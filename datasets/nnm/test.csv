https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-area-mom-foothills-school-division-cease-and-desist-letter-1.5122008,Maybe in grade 11 and 12....but this is nuts.,0.0,101.0,"A Calgary-area mother who spoke out to CBC News over concerns about a large combined Grade 2 class at Red Deer Lake School has been handed a cease-and-desist letter by a law firm on behalf of the school board.

The letter — served on behalf of the Foothills School Division — was written by Brownlee LLP, a large Edmonton law firm, and penned two days after CBC's original story was published.

""It's an example of trying to squash a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Gillian Colborne, one of the mothers who spoke to CBC News after pulling her son from the class over concerns he was struggling in a large room with 47 kids and two teachers.

Colborne, who has another child attending the school, says parents have been trying to get answers from the school division for months, and she was surprised to receive the three-page cease-and-desist letter.

Other parents have also received the letter and are not willing to be interviewed as a result.

""We are parents attempting to advocate for our children in a very calm open manner,"" said Colborne. ""It just seems unnecessary. I would have expected somebody to come to us and say, 'Oh, these are real and valid concerns you have. Let's sit down and talk about them.'""

Parents could be banned from school

The letter accuses parents of making false allegations in communications to various parties. It claims they've made defamatory comments, filed malicious complaints and says that they could be banned from the school. It also threatens legal action if they don't refrain from repeating or publishing their comments.

""Your advocacy has exceeded the boundaries of productive dialogue and devolved into disparaging the professional reputation of well-respected educators,"" the letter states.

It goes on to say the Foothills School Division has responded to each concern relating to their children. It accuses the parents of repeatedly pressuring school staff members through text messages, emails — as well as in person — and says several staff members claim they felt ""unduly pressured by your relentless tactics.""

""To be clear, you are to cease sending all e-mail or other correspondence that contains false or defamatory comments regarding any Foothills School Division employee to anyone. Any failure on your part to take heed of this warning may result in legal proceedings.""

The Foothills School division declined CBC's request for an interview. In a written statement, a spokesperson says: ""At times actions must be taken to ensure that third parties do not negatively impact a school environment and workplace.""

""We feel that we have fully addressed any questions surrounding the Grade 2 classroom configuration at Red Deer Lake School,"" the email states.

""We maintain that it is an effective learning environment. As we stated previously, all parents are welcome to continue to discuss with their child's teacher(s) and school administration any concerns they have about their child's learning.""

Barbara Silva with Support Our Students Alberta calls the cease-and-desist letters 'heavy-handed.' (CBC)

Letter called 'heavy-handed'

""It seems like a very heavy-handed way to shut this conversation down,"" said Barbara Silva, communications director with Support Our Students Alberta. ""Once you bring in legal counsel, it sets up a David and Goliath dynamic.""

Silva says she believes the parents' concerns about a large combined classroom are ""well-founded"" and exist around the province.

While her organization regularly hears from parents who feel their concerns aren't taken seriously by school divisions, Silva says she's never heard of a division taking this kind of legal step.

""Just the sheer image of a school board putting out cease-and-desist orders is pretty alarming,"" said Silva, who admits she isn't privy to all the communications that have occurred between the parents, the school and the school division.

""It puts parents in a position that either they're not going to come forward with their concerns, or they understand really clearly they're going to need to get legal counsel to do so. And that's going to make sure that a lot of people don't come forward with their concerns.""

https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/05/16/trudeau-takes-aim-at-big-tech-announces-digital-charter.html,Is there any country where that exists.,2.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says a gun smuggling 'pipeline' moves firearms across the border from the U.S. into Canada illegally. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Wes Winkel, is the owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to pick out a possible straw buyer, and law enforcement authorities have been slow to identify them based on sales records. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

Because our football team practiced ~25hrs a week, should that be included.",1.0,58.0,"Players, parents and coaches are angry that the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation has decided to cancel public school rugby games across the province because of safety concerns.

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cannabis-testing-oilpatch-datac-1.5146681?cmp=rss,You should only be held to the same standard as police officers in your local jurisdiction.,4.0,9.0,"Seven months after the legalization of recreational cannabis, Garnet Amundson's worries have not abated.

Amundson is chief executive of Calgary-based Essential Energy Services, with nearly 400 workers, including 350 in safety-sensitive roles in the oilpatch.

Topping his list of concerns is having employees who can pass any type of drug test on any given day and arrive at work without any impairment.

Not only does his company drug test employees in certain instances, but the staff may also be tested when they perform work at a facility owned by a different firm. In that case, Amundson said his workers have to meet the standards of the other company.

""Employees have to be completely clean at all times, so they can access these top customers and get on to their job sites,"" he said.

It's a situation underscoring the human resource and legal issues created by the legalization of cannabis for industries where any sign of impairment is closely monitored and safety is a priority.

The oilpatch, for example, has worked hard to get a handle on substance abuse for several years and the legalization of recreational cannabis presents another challenge for companies dealing with the often thorny issue of drug testing.

Testing for cannabis is not as advanced as using a breathalyzer to gauge someone's impairment from alcohol. A urine test for cannabis, for instance, can detect THC, but can't necessarily judge a person's level of impairment.

""I think people maybe have been a bit misinformed believing that there is a completely accurate and reliable way to test for impairment with cannabis,"" said Amundson.

No wonder the legalization of cannabis is proving to be logistically challenging for Amundson and other employers across the country.

Legal grey areas and a lack of definitive tests mean ""complete abstinence from some of these substances is required,"" Amundson said.

Watch as industrial firms deal cannabis legalization:

Impairment is a concern in many industries such as oil and gas, forestry, mining and transportation, where workers are at a high risk of injury.

Other companies in different sectors also continue to grapple with the legalization of cannabis and, in particular, how to respect a worker's right to consume the substance while also ensuring no one is impaired on the job.

""It's a challenge for all employers in Canada, but especially small and medium-sized businesses that don't have the financial or technical resources to manage this themselves,"" said Tim Salter with the Drug and Alcohol Testing Association of Canada.

Some companies are telling workers to abstain from cannabis altogether. (Ben Nelms/CBC)

The major active ingredient in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can be found during urine testing up to 30 days after a worker uses cannabis, said Salter, but that only provides so much information.

""There's really no way for employers to reasonably screen for impairment,"" he said, ""outside of doing a blood test which is not going to happen at the workplace.""

That's where legal issues can occur. If there is an accident on a job site, a company is allowed to do post-incident drug testing. The urine sample may find traces of THC, but again, the test can't judge the level of impairment. That's why a company may not be able to say whether the worker was at fault because of cannabis or not, since there is no definitive proof that THC contributed to the accident.

""Employers are just forced into this corner of promoting abstinence,"" said Salter. ""It's most definitely a mess because the governments really haven't done a great job of preparing the industry for the legalization of cannabis.""

Eventually, Salter said, the court system will have to decide on many of the issues cannabis presents for employers.

One workplace dispute was in front of the Newfoundland Supreme Court recently focusing on a construction labourer who was working on the Lower Churchill hydroelectric project in Labrador.

The man was prescribed cannabis to manage pain due to Crohn's disease and osteoarthritis, since other medication wasn't as effective. His company tried to accommodate his use of cannabis, but couldn't.

Ultimately, the construction company wouldn't give the man any work because of the risk of impairment in the safety-sensitive job site. The province's top court agreed, pointing to how accommodating the worker ""would amount to undue hardship"" for the company.

Each case is different, but the court ruling shows how companies could refuse work to those who use cannabis, medically or not, depending on the dose and the type of job.

Safety first

So far, the legalization of cannabis has not contributed to an increase in workplace accidents, according to Murray Elliott, the chief executive of Energy Safety Canada, although it's too early for reliable statistics.

""There has been very little impact or change in impairment in the workplace,"" said Elliott.

While testing techniques for cannabis are evolving, Elliott said the accuracy is good and there are general guidelines companies can follow to gauge what level of THC in someone's body is a significant risk of impairment.

""There is not necessarily a direct link between the levels of cannabis that show up in testing and whether there is impairment or not. It's really only a risk of impairment,"" he said.

The legalization of cannabis has not contributed to an increase in workplace accidents, according to Murray Elliott with Energy Safety Canada. (Kyle Bakx/CBC)

In preparing for legalization, companies took a range of approaches, such as updating their existing drug and alcohol policies.

Sinopec Canada, an oil and gas producer, spent nine months before legalization to create a policy that would respect the rights of workers, legally protect the company, and also ensure a safe workplace.

Kara Bennik, a human resources advisor with the company, said they set out to be as informed as they could about the issue, consulting different departments to incorporate a range of views.

""We're still evolving and growing our program,"" said Bennik. ""The reality is that future legislation is going to continue to come in.""

Considering the struggles of the oilpatch in recent years, the sector hasn't hired too many workers, but when that happens, Amundson, with Essential Energy Services, worries there will be fewer qualified applicants than before because of the pre-employment drug test.

Already during some hiring, Amundson said the applicants are asked at the end of their interviews if they would pass a drug test.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/canada-first-face-transplant-one-year-later-1.5125849,Thats damn impressive.,2.0,32.0,"When a Montreal medical team pulled off the country's first face transplant last spring, it was a historic moment for Canadian medicine, but the patient's recovery remained far from certain.

Maurice Desjardins's life since then has been full of setbacks, but he has so far avoided the worst-case scenario — his body's rejection of the graft.

As Radio-Canada's current affairs program Découverte reported last year, Desjardins was disfigured in a 2011 hunting accident. He was left with half of a face, as well as chronic pain and severe damage to the nerves, muscles and bones in his face.

Everything changed last spring, when surgeon Dr. Daniel Borsuk and his team performed the high-risk procedure at Montreal's Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. They successfully grafted a donor's jaw, teeth, nose and cartilage onto Desjardins's face — all in one piece.

""I was in control during the graft, but afterwards, during the recovery time, I was no longer in control of anything,"" Borsuk told Découverte recently. He said it's been a stressful and challenging year for Desjardins.

Eating is one of many tasks that remain difficult for Desjardins, who still relies on a feeding tube. Anything he can eat has to be ground up first. Since the operation, he's lost 65 pounds.

Much of his care rests on the shoulders of his wife, Gaétane, who helps administer the 15 or so daily medications, and drives Desjardins back and forth between their home in Notre-Dame-de-la-Sallette and checkups two hours away in Montreal.

When I see Maurice, I am relaxed. It's when I'm not with him, that's when I'm stressed. - Dr. Daniel Borsuk

""I'm always afraid of making a mistake. There are so many different types of medication. I have to pay close attention to what I'm doing,"" she told Découverte. ""It's really a 24/7 job.""

It all became too much for Gaétane to juggle, so she gave up her job to take care of her husband full-time. That was a financial blow to the couple.

Borsuk said he didn't realize there was a lack of financial support for transplant patients.

""I think that we have a great public [health care] system and I think it works really well, but the problem with some of these transplant patients is most of them don't live near a transplant centre,"" he said.

Desjardins and his wife say they're grateful to the family of the donor for their sacrifice. (Charles Dagenais/Radio-Canada)

""They have to leave their homes, get in their car, pay for parking, pay for gas, pay for medication, which aren't always covered. And so it ends up being a quite expensive year for these patients.""

Special patient-doctor bond

During their shared journey, Dr. Borsuk and his patient have grown close.

""There have been a lot of ups and downs. A lot of waves,"" Desjardins said in a recent interview with Découverte.

Borsuk said that every success and obstacle is felt by both of them. During checkups, it's normal for them to clasp hands or even hug.

""I am close to my patients, but with him, it's another level,"" said Borsuk. ""Maybe it's a bit too close? But that's on me.""

The surgeon admitted that it can be difficult to manage relationships with patients like Desjardins, whose day-to-day well-being is often on his mind.

Dr. Daniel Borsuk and Desjardins share a hug. After a year of ups and downs since the surgery, the two men have grown close. (Charles Dagenais/Radio-Canada)

""When I see Maurice, I am relaxed,"" Borsuk said. ""It's when I'm not with him, that's when I'm stressed.""

Bout of infections, low morale

The price of his new face is that Desjardins must take powerful immunosuppressants for the rest of his life. The medication is a double-edged sword: while it helps prevent his body from rejecting the transplant, it also leaves him vulnerable to even the slightest infections.

""He caught everything that he could catch,"" Gaétane said. Three major infections sent Desjardins to hospital repeatedly over the course of his recovery. He spent a total of three months in hospital.

It all came to a head in March, when he fell ill with an infection of the digestive system known as diverticulitis. A pocket of his intestine became infected, and then ruptured.

He caught everything that he could catch. - Gaétane Desjardins

He underwent a surgery so that doctors could attach a temporary colostomy bag, an external pouch that will collect his body's waste while his intestine heals.

The hospitalizations, plus the incessant checkups, have taken a toll on Desjardins and his wife. For a few months, he lost his morale and stopped bothering with his exercises, which are essential for him to regain complete control of his face and his jaw.

""You know, I can't blame him,"" Dr. Borsuk said. ""It's hard to focus on doing your exercises when you have things that are physically hurting you.""

April 2019 was the first time in a year that Desjardins had gone two weeks without an infection.

""I have been happy for two weeks, because I've been out of the hospital for two weeks,"" he said at the time.

But the break from his exercises means Desjardins can no longer close his mouth as fully as he could before, and his speech is limited. It's difficult for him to express himself.

When Desjardins speaks, Gaétane will often ""translate"" for the benefit of other people, because his speech can be difficult to understand.

Gaétane Desjardins said she had to give up her job, because taking care of her husband is too demanding. (Charles Dagenais/Radio-Canada)

Borsuk said he's confident that his patient will work hard to regain control of his jaw.

""I know he'll get it back,"" he said. ""It's like when you have a cast on your wrist: If you don't move your wrist for a month, it's going to be stiff.""

Grateful to donor's family

Dr. Suzon Collette, who is responsible for monitoring Desjardins's recovery, said what he's gone through in this past year is typical for a transplant patient.

""There are good times, months where everything is going well, and then there are steps back, defeats, unexpected things,"" she said.

Despite the obstacles, Collette said at the end of the day, the patients find a way to make it through.

One thing Desjardins has not struggled with is accepting his new physical identity. The medical team had been afraid that he might be upset or disturbed when he saw the reflection of a stranger in the mirror.

Now he finds himself handsome, and it's true. He is. - Gaétane Desjardins

But Desjardins said that wasn't difficult for him. More than anything, he's just thankful.

""It's going very well. I am so grateful to the donor's family,"" he said.

Gaétane said she likes the way her husband looks. She said that before the accident, he never thought much about his face.

""Now, he finds himself handsome, and it's true. He is,"" she said.

Despite all the post-surgery pain and difficulty, Desjardins said he has no regrets about the procedure.

""It was worth it,"" he said recently, while sitting on his couch at home, holding hands with his wife.

Gaétane agreed, smiling at her husband."

Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Slim selection

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

Mounties say they've tracked down a man who waited nearly half an hour in line for a quick turn at the RCMP's photo booth, just for the ""honour"" of standing next to two RCMP officers.

Officers set up their station at the Vaisakhi parade in Surrey, B.C., on April 20, on standby to chat and take photos with anyone who came by. About half a million people marched through the city for the festivities and a line of people waiting to take a photo with two RCMP officers in their red serges grew long.

When the man's turn came, he said he didn't have a camera. Amandeep Takhar, who was volunteering at the booth, said the man told him ""he just wanted the honour of standing alongside two Surrey RCMP members.""

Takhar, 28, took a photo on his personal phone anyway, showing the man dressed in a neat blue windbreaker between the officers with his hands resting on his cane.

""When he came down, I asked him in Punjabi if there's anywhere I could send it to, if he had a phone number or an email and he said that he didn't. He just mentioned, 'I just wanted to be up there and take a picture with them. They do a lot to keep us safe,'"" said Takhar, who's been volunteering with the RCMP's communities program for two years.

""He reminded me of my own grandfather. Such a sweet, calm guy. Soft-spoken gentleman.""

Takhar posted the photo on Twitter, hoping to track down the man's family.

On Tuesday afternoon, Surrey RCMP said they'd identified the man, and he'll visit the detachment soon to receive a copy of his photo."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-senate-resolution-charter-1.5128399,Why would Canada by aircraft from the USA who will be the only one who can maintain it while also being Canada's biggest threat ? Because the military leaders who want to get on their knees to pray to kiss U.S. ass want the f35?,1.0,73.0,"The United States Senate has passed a resolution praising the Canadian government for the way it has conducted itself in the case of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

The resolution commends ""the government of Canada for upholding the rule of law and expressing concern over actions by the government of the People's Republic of China in response to a request from the United States government to the government of Canada for the extradition of a Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. executive.""

The resolution is nonbinding and is considered an expression of the Senate's will on the issue.

Canada has face widespread political and economic pressure from China since Meng's arrest in December and has been looking to its international allies for diplomatic assistance.

In February, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland met with U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, to ask for American help in its ongoing tussle with China over Meng's arrest. Risch ultimately introduced the Senate resolution.

Since Meng's arrest, China has placed a number of trade hurdles in front of Canadian exporters — banning imports from two canola producers, tying up shipments over paperwork and putting unusual obstacles in the way of Canadian soybean and pea exporters.

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December after Canadian officials detained Meng in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S. She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.

In March, China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him by Spavor.

'Arbitrary detention'

In December, a few months before that accusation was made, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Kovrig and Spavor were being unlawfully detained and should be returned to Canada.

That position was affirmed by the Senate Tuesday in a resolution that expressed concern over China's ""apparent arbitrary detention and abusive treatment of Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in apparent retaliation for the government of Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou.""

One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial in January. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling. Last month, a Chinese court sentenced another Canadian, Fan Wei, to death for participating in a global methamphetamine operation.

Meng's Charter of Rights defence

The resolution landed as Meng's defence team said it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the U.S. because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest at Vancouver's airport was unlawful.

Benjamin Howes, a spokesman for Huawei Canada, told reporters in Vancouver Wednesday that Meng's legal team will also argue that her rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated during her arrest.

""Ms. Meng intends to apply to the court for a stay of the extradition proceedings. Canadians value the rule of law and the Charter of Rights,"" he said.

""We have trust in the Canadian legal process and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored.""

According to the federal government's guide to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ""any person in Canada – whether they are a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident or a newcomer – has the rights and freedoms contained in the Charter.""

Seeking more documents

During a hearing Wednesday, Crown prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley, who is representing the Attorney General of Canada, asked Justice Heather Holmes to see that Meng's case proceeds as quickly as possible, proposing a first court date by the end of August.

He said the allegations against Meng centre on a misrepresentation she is alleged to have made to a bank that put the institution's economic interests at risk, adding it's not yet time to make arguments in the case.

The defence said it needs more time to gather documents through freedom of information requests. It also wants audio from Meng's questioning at the time of her arrest, which already has been described as unlawful in a civil suit."

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

Star Editorial | Christchurch Call is a good step in fighting extremism

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

""It's an example of trying to squash a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Gillian Colborne, one of the mothers who spoke to CBC News after pulling her son from the class over concerns he was struggling in a large room with 47 kids and two teachers.

Colborne, who has another child attending the school, says parents have been trying to get answers from the school division for months, and she was surprised to receive the three-page cease-and-desist letter.

Other parents have also received the letter and are not willing to be interviewed as a result.

""We are parents attempting to advocate for our children in a very calm open manner,"" said Colborne. ""It just seems unnecessary. I would have expected somebody to come to us and say, 'Oh, these are real and valid concerns you have. Let's sit down and talk about them.'""

Parents could be banned from school

The letter accuses parents of making false allegations in communications to various parties. It claims they've made defamatory comments, filed malicious complaints and says that they could be banned from the school. It also threatens legal action if they don't refrain from repeating or publishing their comments.

""Your advocacy has exceeded the boundaries of productive dialogue and devolved into disparaging the professional reputation of well-respected educators,"" the letter states.

It goes on to say the Foothills School Division has responded to each concern relating to their children. It accuses the parents of repeatedly pressuring school staff members through text messages, emails — as well as in person — and says several staff members claim they felt ""unduly pressured by your relentless tactics.""

""To be clear, you are to cease sending all e-mail or other correspondence that contains false or defamatory comments regarding any Foothills School Division employee to anyone. Any failure on your part to take heed of this warning may result in legal proceedings.""

The Foothills School division declined CBC's request for an interview. In a written statement, a spokesperson says: ""At times actions must be taken to ensure that third parties do not negatively impact a school environment and workplace.""

""We feel that we have fully addressed any questions surrounding the Grade 2 classroom configuration at Red Deer Lake School,"" the email states.

""We maintain that it is an effective learning environment. As we stated previously, all parents are welcome to continue to discuss with their child's teacher(s) and school administration any concerns they have about their child's learning.""

Barbara Silva with Support Our Students Alberta calls the cease-and-desist letters 'heavy-handed.' (CBC)

Letter called 'heavy-handed'

""It seems like a very heavy-handed way to shut this conversation down,"" said Barbara Silva, communications director with Support Our Students Alberta. ""Once you bring in legal counsel, it sets up a David and Goliath dynamic.""

Silva says she believes the parents' concerns about a large combined classroom are ""well-founded"" and exist around the province.

While her organization regularly hears from parents who feel their concerns aren't taken seriously by school divisions, Silva says she's never heard of a division taking this kind of legal step.

""Just the sheer image of a school board putting out cease-and-desist orders is pretty alarming,"" said Silva, who admits she isn't privy to all the communications that have occurred between the parents, the school and the school division.

""It puts parents in a position that either they're not going to come forward with their concerns, or they understand really clearly they're going to need to get legal counsel to do so. And that's going to make sure that a lot of people don't come forward with their concerns.""

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2019/05/10/beer-store-union-launches-ad-blitz-attacking-premier-doug-ford-for-threatening-7000-jobs.html,Why?,2.0,70.0,"Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

They ran an article a few days ago doubting Trudeau’s re-election and provided reasons why he has let people down.,7.0,56.0,"Story transcript

Curling has been a staple of Canadian winters for decades, but there are some things that have changed over the years — like a skip sliding down the ice with a cigarette in his mouth.

Orest (The Big O) Meleschuk knows a little about smoking on the international stage, because he is the skip in a video that As It Happens recently dug up from the CBC Archives.

In it, a younger Meleschuk can be seen throwing an extremely important rock for Team Canada at the 1972 Silver Broom world championship in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria — complete with a lit dart in his mouth.

""Well you know, if it sits in an ashtray it's going to burn out and I was quite frugal in those days,"" Meleschuk told As It Happens host Carol Off from his home in Selkirk, Man.

""I didn't want to waste it.""

That throw by Meleschuk began one of the most contentious plays in curling history — known as the ""Great Kicked Rock Caper"".

The Canadian team needed two points to force another end against Team U.S.A., or the game was over and Canada would not hold their title for the fifth consecutive year.

As Meleschuk explains, he knocked the U.S. rock out but the Canadian's tying rock rolled farther than he had anticipated. Thinking they had won, the U.S. skip Bob LaBonte ran onto the ice, slipped and kicked the Canadian rock in premature celebration. ​

Canada ended up winning the match in an extra end.

'Beer out of a stein'

Meleschuk says he can't remember exactly how Team Canada celebrated their championship win, but since the match was held in Bavaria it was probably with a beer as opposed to their regular drink — whiskey straight.

""I drank my beer out of a stein, this way they didn't know whether it was milk or water or beer.""

Meleschuk remembered how popular smoking was back in the '70s and how much rinks have changed.

""A lot of curlers smoked. [There were] ashtrays on the boards and back of the ends. Ashtrays all over the place,"" he said.

But he admits that after watching video footage after the event of himself curling with a cigarette, he was a ""little bit embarrassed"" and decided to quit smoking.

""I quit after that year because I was watching a few films and I thought it was so disgusting that I thought I better quit,"" he said.

A broom a game

Meleschuk said he is impressed with how far the equipment has come in the last 40 years — most notably the brooms.

""In those days ... a broomer used to go through a broom almost every two games,"" he said.

""They really go through a broom in a game but we couldn't afford to buy that many brooms so you kept the broom as long as you could.""

That's because the brooms were made out of straw, as opposed to the squeegee-like brushes that are used now. The brooms would leave the sweepers with blisters all over their hands — something Meleschuk doesn't think curlers could handle now.

""I don't think any of the brushers now could flop that broom around from one end to the other for 12 ends, which we used to play,"" he said.

It also meant that there was straw all over the ice, something that could impede the rock if the house sweeper didn't do their job properly.

When it was pointed out to him that the cigarette ash on the ice may have also been a factor, Meleschuk laughed.

""That's why we used to have burnt rocks, because of the hot ashes."""

Andrew Leslie, a retired lieutenant-general who was elected in 2015, is stepping away from politics after one term as an MP.

""I believe it is time for me to take a new path,"" Leslie wrote in a letter posted on his website.

Leslie will step down from his parliamentary secretary role but will remain on as an MP until the writ is dropped.

Leslie took on ""special responsibilities"" as parliamentary secretary, focusing on the Canada-U.S. relations file. He held the position during the NAFTA negotiations last year involving Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland.

In his letter, he thanks Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for appointing him to the role and praised some of the Liberal government's work, specifically on infrastructure and defence spending.

Leslie also touts the money the Liberals have spent in the last three budgets to support veterans, but adds he hopes more will come.

Liberals losing incumbents

Leslie's announcement comes as the Liberals have been slipping in the polls, and follows other party incumbents who have said they won't be running for the October election. They include:

Longtime Nova Scotia MP Rodger Cuzner, who announced last week he won't be seeking re-election. Cuzner served as parliamentary secretary to former prime minister Jean Chrétien in 2003. He also served as chair of the Nova Scotia caucus and party whip.

Cuzner's longtime friend and colleague, Sydney-Victoria MP Mark Eyking, who made the announcement in February.

Scott Brison, another longtime Nova Scotia MP and former Liberal cabinet minister, said in January he would be stepping away from politics. He stepped down as an MP in February.

/s",-1.0,9.0,"The Trudeau government is expanding a federal loan guarantee program for farmers in response to Western Canada's canola crisis — more than doubling the maximum amount of money available to individual producers.

CBC News has learned the federal government is set to announce at a news conference Wednesday morning a boost to the maximum amount available to individual farmers under the Advance Payments Program (APP), from $400,000 per year to $1 million.

The news comes not long after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised that help for canola farmers would be ""coming out in a few days.""

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr will announce details at a news conference on Parliament Hill at 9:30 a.m. ET and CBCNews.ca will carry it live.

Under the former APP rules, producers could receive up to $400,000 per year in advances based on the value of their crops or livestock, with the federal government paying the interest on the first $100,000.

Producers repay the advances after they sell their product. Cash advanced for most commodities has to be repaid in 18 months; cattle and bison producers get 24 months to pay.

Ottawa is changing the APP rules in response to market turmoil in the canola sector. China has blocked Canadian canola seed from Richardson International and Viterra, two of Canada's biggest exporters, saying that shipments were contaminated with pests.

Other China-bound shipments of Canadian canola have been cancelled, forcing exporters to sell the seed elsewhere at a discount. And Reuters reports more commodities are hitting inspection roadblocks at Chinese ports, leaving exporters to scramble for alternate markets.

Canadian politicians have insisted there is no basis for China's pest claim. China's move is widely seen as an act of retaliation over Canada's decision to arrest Meng Wanzhou, an executive with the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, for extradition to the United States.

""Canadians know, of course, as do people around the world, that Canadian food inspection and the quality of Canadian agriculture and produce is world-class, and the processes we have cannot be beaten anywhere in the world,"" Trudeau told a media event Monday morning.

While the move is being driven by the plight of canola growers, the revised APP program is available to all farmers. For canola farmers, however, the federal government is increasing the interest-free portion of the cash advances to $500,000.

Prime Minister Trudeau is expected to call premiers tonight to fill them in on the new APP rules.

Meanwhile, the Trudeau government is trying to go to the source to end China's trade action. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau recently sent a formal request to Beijing for permission to send Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials to China to personally inspect Canadian canola shipments for pests.

Sources tell CBC News that while Chinese officials have been talking positively about the trade relationship with Canada and their desire to solve the canola spat, they've yet to give the CFIA permission to send its own inspectors to China. The sources said the federal government isn't viewing China's stance as an outright rejection of its proposal and plans to keep pushing the idea with Beijing.

Meanwhile, Ottawa continues to search for new markets for Canadian canola. International Trade Minister Jim Carr is expected to lead a trade mission to locate buyers beyond the Chinese market but the government isn't sharing details at this point."

I shouldn’t have said that last bit, it was dismissive and ill thought out.  Sorry.

Still, I can imagine that if they were forced off their farmland, which couldn’t have been theirs if they were renting it, like you said, it would have been after the treaties were signed, yes?  So the aboriginal leaders signed the deal they wanted, and it screwed the people they represented?  Well, that’s basically politics in a nutshell.  But the problem back then is the same one now:  they can’t have treaty rights *and* citizen rights.  It’s unfortunate, but that’s how it works.

Another thing I don’t understand is how if your aboriginal ancestors were kicked off their land, how are you still working it?

Finally, just because FN have been growing beans and corn for centuries doesn’t mean *all* of them were.  It certainly doesn’t mean the tribes in what is now Canada were farming on a consistent basis before the white man came along. From what I understand, they were a fairly nomadic people, and that doesn’t work well for an agrarian society.  South American natives are not the same as North American natives, and it kind of sounds a bit racist to lump every tribe in the Western Hemisphere into one big box you’ve labeled“aboriginal”, and then ascribe every cultural trait from every tribal society to every single one of them.

Carrying signs, the demonstrators walked from city hall down Main Street to Portage Avenue, and then up Memorial Boulevard, before ending at the Manitoba Legislative Building.

Eric Jasysyn helped organize the walk and hoped to get the attention of politicians.

""It is time to start seeing change and it's time to start getting them the water that they deserve,"" he said.

""We want to start getting people hearing our voices.""

According to Indigenous Services Canada, 57 First Nations across Canada were under long-term drinking water advisories, including four in Manitoba, as of April 27.

Indigenous Services Canada has set a date of March 2021 to have all long-term water advisories lifted on Canadian First Nations, and says 85 of the advisories have been lifted since November 2015.

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte threatened in April to “declare war” if Canada did not take back the containers, which were shipped by a private firm in 2013 and 2014 and have been sitting at the port in Manila ever since.

Duterte later threatened to load the containers onto a ship and dump it on Canadian beaches if it was not retrieved.

His threat of war prompted Canadian officials to say for the first time that they were willing to bring it back after some negotiations took place.

At issue in the dispute is the practice of shipping recycling for processing in other countries.

While countries like Canada used to be able to sell their recycled materials to countries like Malaysia, China and the Philippines, those countries no longer want to buy the recyclables, which were previously converted into more valuable materials used in industrial processing.

Contamination of the recyclables has also emerged as a growing concern given the additional work required to sort and dispose of material labelled as recycling if it is not actually fit for processing either because it is dirty or the material is of a low quality."

The letter — served on behalf of the Foothills School Division — was written by Brownlee LLP, a large Edmonton law firm, and penned two days after CBC's original story was published.

""It's an example of trying to squash a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Gillian Colborne, one of the mothers who spoke to CBC News after pulling her son from the class over concerns he was struggling in a large room with 47 kids and two teachers.

Colborne, who has another child attending the school, says parents have been trying to get answers from the school division for months, and she was surprised to receive the three-page cease-and-desist letter.

Other parents have also received the letter and are not willing to be interviewed as a result.

""We are parents attempting to advocate for our children in a very calm open manner,"" said Colborne. ""It just seems unnecessary. I would have expected somebody to come to us and say, 'Oh, these are real and valid concerns you have. Let's sit down and talk about them.'""

Parents could be banned from school

The letter accuses parents of making false allegations in communications to various parties. It claims they've made defamatory comments, filed malicious complaints and says that they could be banned from the school. It also threatens legal action if they don't refrain from repeating or publishing their comments.

""Your advocacy has exceeded the boundaries of productive dialogue and devolved into disparaging the professional reputation of well-respected educators,"" the letter states.

It goes on to say the Foothills School Division has responded to each concern relating to their children. It accuses the parents of repeatedly pressuring school staff members through text messages, emails — as well as in person — and says several staff members claim they felt ""unduly pressured by your relentless tactics.""

""To be clear, you are to cease sending all e-mail or other correspondence that contains false or defamatory comments regarding any Foothills School Division employee to anyone. Any failure on your part to take heed of this warning may result in legal proceedings.""

The Foothills School division declined CBC's request for an interview. In a written statement, a spokesperson says: ""At times actions must be taken to ensure that third parties do not negatively impact a school environment and workplace.""

""We feel that we have fully addressed any questions surrounding the Grade 2 classroom configuration at Red Deer Lake School,"" the email states.

""We maintain that it is an effective learning environment. As we stated previously, all parents are welcome to continue to discuss with their child's teacher(s) and school administration any concerns they have about their child's learning.""

Barbara Silva with Support Our Students Alberta calls the cease-and-desist letters 'heavy-handed.' (CBC)

Letter called 'heavy-handed'

""It seems like a very heavy-handed way to shut this conversation down,"" said Barbara Silva, communications director with Support Our Students Alberta. ""Once you bring in legal counsel, it sets up a David and Goliath dynamic.""

Silva says she believes the parents' concerns about a large combined classroom are ""well-founded"" and exist around the province.

While her organization regularly hears from parents who feel their concerns aren't taken seriously by school divisions, Silva says she's never heard of a division taking this kind of legal step.

""Just the sheer image of a school board putting out cease-and-desist orders is pretty alarming,"" said Silva, who admits she isn't privy to all the communications that have occurred between the parents, the school and the school division.

""It puts parents in a position that either they're not going to come forward with their concerns, or they understand really clearly they're going to need to get legal counsel to do so. And that's going to make sure that a lot of people don't come forward with their concerns.""

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says a gun smuggling 'pipeline' moves firearms across the border from the U.S. into Canada illegally. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Wes Winkel, is the owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to pick out a possible straw buyer, and law enforcement authorities have been slow to identify them based on sales records. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

The study out of Dalhousie University also found that 60 per cent of cannabis users continue to buy from the same supplier as they did before smoking pot became legal last year.

""The reason why they did that is for convenience, quality and most importantly price,"" lead author Sylvain Charlebois told CBC's Maritime Noon on Thursday.

""The price of cannabis in the black market is actually much lower, much more affordable than the legal cannabis.""

Charlebois said he believes when edibles become legal, it could actually continue to fuel the black market.

""The regulatory framework presented by Health Canada is so restrictive that it won't entice manufacturers in Canada to produce edibles,"" he said.

""If there is appetite to consume edibles — no pun — people will actually look for that product. And we may actually see more products being imported into Canada illegally to support that demand.""

Drop in legalization support

The study surveyed 1,051 Canadians over four days last month. The estimated margin of error is 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20. The aim was to compare attitudes before and after October 2018 legalization.

It found the number of Canadians in support of legalization in general fell by 19 per cent — and uncertainty about legalization rose by seven per cent. Only about six per cent of people reported starting using since legalization.

Of the 68 per cent of Canadians who were in favour of legalizing cannabis in 2017, 93 per cent of that group were willing to try an edible product. That dropped to 70 per cent in April.

""That's a significant drop,"" Charlebois said, adding it's probably for a number of different reasons — including media reports of specific incidents, such as when a four-year-old girl in Nova Scotia was hospitalized after accidentally ingesting cannabis-infused chocolate.

The study also found that Canadians are worried about edibles posing a greater risk to children (64 per cent) and pets (54 per cent).

Of those surveyed, 20 per cent said while they don't use cannabis now, they might consider edibles once they become legal. (Shutterstock / Pong Pong)

Charlebois said he believes Health Canada has been focusing on mitigating the risk of cannabis products and not actually educating people.

""We figured out that Canadians are mostly cannabinoid illiterate,"" he said.

People are also concerned about privacy: almost half said they're uncertain about their co-workers knowing they use cannabis recreationally.

The study also found edibles carry less stigma than other forms of cannabis, and 20 per cent of respondents said while they don't use cannabis now, they might consider edibles once they become legal.

Charlebois said in Colorado, where marijuana is also legal, 50 per cent of all sales are edibles.

""The edible market in particular really has got a lot of people to consume cannabis, when really they didn't when only the dry stuff was legal. So we are expecting that to happen in Canada as well,"" he said.

While stigma wasn't something addressed in the 2017 study, Charlebois said the most recent findings suggest more than half of people believe retail facilities should be kept out of residential neighbourhoods. Less than 20 per cent said they're worried about being seen buying cannabis.

""The stigma was not as high or as strong as we thought it would be. However we have a long way to go from seeing cannabis become socially normalized in Canada,"" Charlebois said.

Edit: Grammar",2.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

READ MORE: Atlantic Canada clean energy collaboration receives $2M federal investment

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

Used fuel from the Bruce Power plant is stored in the form of pellets that fit into tubes. These tubes are collected into bundles and packed into carbon steel tubes coated in copper. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository. If so, it seems like one more question may arise in the years ahead: does it really makes sense to build two?"

Curling has been a staple of Canadian winters for decades, but there are some things that have changed over the years — like a skip sliding down the ice with a cigarette in his mouth.

Orest (The Big O) Meleschuk knows a little about smoking on the international stage, because he is the skip in a video that As It Happens recently dug up from the CBC Archives.

In it, a younger Meleschuk can be seen throwing an extremely important rock for Team Canada at the 1972 Silver Broom world championship in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria — complete with a lit dart in his mouth.

""Well you know, if it sits in an ashtray it's going to burn out and I was quite frugal in those days,"" Meleschuk told As It Happens host Carol Off from his home in Selkirk, Man.

""I didn't want to waste it.""

That throw by Meleschuk began one of the most contentious plays in curling history — known as the ""Great Kicked Rock Caper"".

The Canadian team needed two points to force another end against Team U.S.A., or the game was over and Canada would not hold their title for the fifth consecutive year.

As Meleschuk explains, he knocked the U.S. rock out but the Canadian's tying rock rolled farther than he had anticipated. Thinking they had won, the U.S. skip Bob LaBonte ran onto the ice, slipped and kicked the Canadian rock in premature celebration. ​

Canada ended up winning the match in an extra end.

'Beer out of a stein'

Meleschuk says he can't remember exactly how Team Canada celebrated their championship win, but since the match was held in Bavaria it was probably with a beer as opposed to their regular drink — whiskey straight.

""I drank my beer out of a stein, this way they didn't know whether it was milk or water or beer.""

Meleschuk remembered how popular smoking was back in the '70s and how much rinks have changed.

""A lot of curlers smoked. [There were] ashtrays on the boards and back of the ends. Ashtrays all over the place,"" he said.

But he admits that after watching video footage after the event of himself curling with a cigarette, he was a ""little bit embarrassed"" and decided to quit smoking.

""I quit after that year because I was watching a few films and I thought it was so disgusting that I thought I better quit,"" he said.

A broom a game

Meleschuk said he is impressed with how far the equipment has come in the last 40 years — most notably the brooms.

""In those days ... a broomer used to go through a broom almost every two games,"" he said.

""They really go through a broom in a game but we couldn't afford to buy that many brooms so you kept the broom as long as you could.""

That's because the brooms were made out of straw, as opposed to the squeegee-like brushes that are used now. The brooms would leave the sweepers with blisters all over their hands — something Meleschuk doesn't think curlers could handle now.

""I don't think any of the brushers now could flop that broom around from one end to the other for 12 ends, which we used to play,"" he said.

It also meant that there was straw all over the ice, something that could impede the rock if the house sweeper didn't do their job properly.

When it was pointed out to him that the cigarette ash on the ice may have also been a factor, Meleschuk laughed.

""That's why we used to have burnt rocks, because of the hot ashes."""

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions.

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Lawyer Bob Buckingham, right, represented Harrisson at the trial in St. John's. (Mark Quinn/ CBC)

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/niqilurniq-inuit-cookbook-igloolik-1.5126404,The phrase is not commonly used at all - it basically never shows up in daily life.  That's one of reasons I tend to be a bit skeptical when people go on about this.,-2.0,24.0,"Its pages feature a smorgasbord of delectable dishes, including ramen, tartare, pizza and stroganoff, but the recipes feature Arctic char, seal, whale and caribou.

Niqilurniq is a new cookbook written in Inuktitut Roman orthography. It was compiled by Annie Desilets, who went to school for cooking at the Institut de tourisme et d'hôtellerie du Québec in Montreal. She worked on the book with four Inuit women in Igloolik — Micah Arreak, Lucy Kappianaq, Glenda Kripanik and Kanadaise Uyarasuk.

Desilets says the idea came to her in 2012, when she was giving cooking lessons in the community.

""I could see there was a lot of interest into learning how to cook, and interest into sharing recipes in the community,"" she said.

""There's not [many] recipes you can find with country food in books, or on the internet, and lots of recipes are difficult to do because you can't find the ingredients in small community stores. So this cookbook takes care of this reality.""

This pizza is topped with Arctic char. (Inhabit Media)

It's split into three sections: imaq, food from the sea; nuna, food from the land; and palaugaat, which is bread recipes.

""We decided not to do like entrees, main dish and this stuff because it's very like southerners' way of thinking,"" said Desilets.

The book doesn't just offer recipes — it also gives nutrition tips.

Desilets said she hopes the book inspires readers to link country food with the types of food available in stores, and give an alternative to prepackaged foods.

""It was important for us to share this knowledge so people can make better choices, know more about what they're eating,"" she said.

""And personally, as a cook, I just wanted to share the joy of cooking.""

Niqilurniq is only available in Inuktitut right now, but Desilets says Inhabit Media is working on an English version. It's for sale on the Inhabit Media website and offered for free as a PDF on the Nunavut Bilingual Education Society website.

As for Nunavummiut who might want to share their own recipes?

""I encourage people from other communities to do [it],"" said Desilets. ""It's … so much fun to do, just sharing recipes, trying it together."""
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-student-immunization-mandatory-education-minister-cardy-1.5155481,"Any individual can be snobby.

That asking why someone thinks something or for clarity would be an issue is troubling. How could asking for clarity be an issue?

As for his inaccurate analogy, I definitely agree direct statements are better, but it at least seemed to illustrate his point that we shouldn't recklessly expose children to dangers. Truthfully, vaccines prevent very dangerous illnesses from spreading. But there is an uninformed group of people who think vaccines are dangerous, and direct statements aren't taken by that group correctly. Allowing children to come to school unvaccinated undermines the relative medical safety we have come to enjoy.

I don't personally see anything the minister said there as hostile. Perhaps his analogy is offensive to some, though I fail to see why it would be. I guess my followup question would be 'hostile to who and how'?",1.0,98.0,"Education Minister Dominic Cardy says any students who don't meet immunization requirements this fall won't be allowed through the school doors unless and until they do.

Cardy isn't just talking about excluding students during an outbreak like the ongoing one in the Saint John area, where 11 cases of measles have been confirmed, nine of which are linked to Kennebecasis Valley High School in Quispamsis. He means barring them from attending school entirely.

""We wouldn't let a child come to school with a gun,"" he said. ""And a child coming to school who's able to transmit easily infectious, fatal diseases is doing just that — they're bringing something dangerous into the school environment,"" he said.

""Certainly, my expectation is that starting in September every child going into a New Brunswick school be there with their vaccine cards to prove that they are not a risk to themselves or others in the school system.""

New Brunswick has a long-standing policy that requires students to either show proof they are immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), varicella (chicken pox) and meningococcal disease, or obtain an exemption for medical or parental objections.

But it hasn't been consistently enforced for years, so the province doesn't know how many unvaccinated students are in the school system.

Cardy intends to change that.

""They will be excluded from school if they are unwilling to follow the rules around health and safety,"" he said, adding he will give people ""a reasonable amount of time"" to comply once public health resources aren't stretched so thin dealing with the measles outbreak.

Personal exemption provision too broad

He also plans to ""tighten up"" the personal exemption provision of Policy 706, which he describes as too broad.

As it stands, parents can ""just say,' I don't want to have my kids vaccinated,'"" he said. ""I don't think that's good enough.

""I am unaware of any faith tradition that tells people that, you know, 'Thy children must be infected with easily preventable diseases.'

""And we also have an option in New Brunswick that if people don't want to be part of a public system, they're free to home school their kids.""

Under Policy 706, children are supposed to be immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, varicella and meningococcal disease before entering the school system. (Canadian Press)

Cardy believes the only exceptions should be for medical reasons to ensure so-called herd immunity, or community immunity.

""If we had that herd immunity, this outbreak wouldn't have happened,"" he said.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, because measles is so highly contagious and spreads so easily, either through the air or direct contact with an infected individual, at least 95 per cent of people need to be vaccinated for herd immunity to work.

""If you don't want to get yourself vaccinated or your kids vaccinated, think about the kids who are suffering from severe immunosuppression"" and can't be vaccinated, said Cardy.

Marissa Gootjes, 15, of Quispamsis, is just one of those students. She was happy to be back at Kennebecasis Valley High School after undergoing brain surgery to remove a cancerous tumour, followed by 13 months of chemotherapy, but now has to stay home because she's at risk of contracting measles.

'Marissa the Fierce' Gootjes, who earned her nickname playing hockey, may be sidelined for the rest of the school year if the measles outbreak continues to grow because she is immunocompromised from undergoing chemotherapy. (Submitted by Jan Gootjes)

Although some people have questioned whether mandatory immunization could violate charter rights, Cardy argued he also has a duty to protect the rights of students who are vulnerable.

""It doesn't make much sense when we spend time talking about move-over laws on highways and bike laws and helmet laws and stuff like that, if we're going to ignore the transmission of infectious, potentially fatal diseases in our schools,"" he said.

""If you're going to be in a public school system, we've got to take public health into account.""

""That's going to be the choice that parents have to make is if they want to participate in the public school system. There are rules around public health there to protect everyone in our society and those rules will be enforced."""

She is not bound to the GTA by any means. Jagmeet Singh is now in Burnaby South, outside his stomping grounds. No reason Philpott couldn’t do the same.",17.0,41.0,"Former Liberal cabinet members Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott say they will make announcements Monday about their political futures.

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,I'll believe all this is genuine as soon as I see nuns walk around with their hair flowing in the breeze.,-5.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

What would suck for them is if the prosecutors decided on their own to seek a DPA, since nobody would believe it happened without interference",0.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/snc-lavalin-trial-corruption-bribery-1.5153429,Of course something will change.  They'll learn how to cover their tracks better.,-6.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

READ MORE: Atlantic Canada clean energy collaboration receives $2M federal investment

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-senate-resolution-charter-1.5128399,Thanks!,5.0,73.0,"The United States Senate has passed a resolution praising the Canadian government for the way it has conducted itself in the case of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

The resolution commends ""the government of Canada for upholding the rule of law and expressing concern over actions by the government of the People's Republic of China in response to a request from the United States government to the government of Canada for the extradition of a Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. executive.""

The resolution is nonbinding and is considered an expression of the Senate's will on the issue.

Canada has face widespread political and economic pressure from China since Meng's arrest in December and has been looking to its international allies for diplomatic assistance.

In February, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland met with U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, to ask for American help in its ongoing tussle with China over Meng's arrest. Risch ultimately introduced the Senate resolution.

Since Meng's arrest, China has placed a number of trade hurdles in front of Canadian exporters — banning imports from two canola producers, tying up shipments over paperwork and putting unusual obstacles in the way of Canadian soybean and pea exporters.

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December after Canadian officials detained Meng in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S. She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.

In March, China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him by Spavor.

'Arbitrary detention'

In December, a few months before that accusation was made, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Kovrig and Spavor were being unlawfully detained and should be returned to Canada.

That position was affirmed by the Senate Tuesday in a resolution that expressed concern over China's ""apparent arbitrary detention and abusive treatment of Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in apparent retaliation for the government of Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou.""

One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial in January. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling. Last month, a Chinese court sentenced another Canadian, Fan Wei, to death for participating in a global methamphetamine operation.

Meng's Charter of Rights defence

The resolution landed as Meng's defence team said it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the U.S. because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest at Vancouver's airport was unlawful.

Benjamin Howes, a spokesman for Huawei Canada, told reporters in Vancouver Wednesday that Meng's legal team will also argue that her rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated during her arrest.

""Ms. Meng intends to apply to the court for a stay of the extradition proceedings. Canadians value the rule of law and the Charter of Rights,"" he said.

""We have trust in the Canadian legal process and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored.""

According to the federal government's guide to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ""any person in Canada – whether they are a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident or a newcomer – has the rights and freedoms contained in the Charter.""

Seeking more documents

During a hearing Wednesday, Crown prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley, who is representing the Attorney General of Canada, asked Justice Heather Holmes to see that Meng's case proceeds as quickly as possible, proposing a first court date by the end of August.

He said the allegations against Meng centre on a misrepresentation she is alleged to have made to a bank that put the institution's economic interests at risk, adding it's not yet time to make arguments in the case.

The defence said it needs more time to gather documents through freedom of information requests. It also wants audio from Meng's questioning at the time of her arrest, which already has been described as unlawful in a civil suit."

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

Claire Avery, a rugby player at Charles P. Allen High School, said she and her teammates were shocked and devastated by the news.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Brooklyn Peyton, who plays rugby for Lockview High School in Fall River, hoped she would go to university on a rugby scholarship.

She said she's blown away by news of the cancellation.

'I just love the team'

""I started with this team, it's important to me, they are like family,"" she said. ""My coach means a lot to me. He's kind of like my second dad ... I just love the team.""

She and other rugby players at Lockview plan to wear their jerseys to school Friday and play some informal games on the school field to show support for the team.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the group has asked to meet with the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation about the decision to cancel school rugby. (CBC)

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

On Friday, police executed a search warrant at a home on Larratt Lane, near Bathurst Street and Elgin Mills Road West, and discovered explosive materials. Police did not specify what exactly the materials were or how much was removed. They said chemicals were also seized.

Ontario Provincial Police, along with the York police's explosives detection unit, helped to removed the materials.

As a precaution, police practically shut down the street on Friday, forcing neighbours from their homes and restricting vehicle and pedestrian traffic as officers carried out their work. Neighbours have since been allowed back into their homes, police said.

Despite, evacuation orders being lifted and the suburban street returning to normal, residents say they have been left feeling uneasy.

In a news release on Tuesday, police said dangerous chemicals being stored in a home can pose serious risks, including fires and explosions.

They urged members of public to call police if they see any suspicious activity, notice chemical odours, or unusual storage or stockpiling of chemicals and to take precautions.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

You should give it a shot.",1.0,51.0,"The cars pass almost silently, but you see hundreds of them on the streets. Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Slim selection

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

Yes.

Japan couldn't prevent this from happening _inside Japan_, and you think Canada can fix this _in the Philippines_???  You want the government to put a system in place that, from experience, obviously doesn't work?

The company has said it's undertaking a major restructuring, and on Monday said that it will have trimmed thousands of jobs by August.

The company said the plan will save about $600 million US per year by eliminating bureaucracy and increasing the number of workers reporting to each manager.

In the U.S., about 2,300 jobs will be cut through buyouts and layoffs. About 1,500 already have happened, and some 500 workers will be let go in the U.S. and Canada this week. A final 300 will be cut in the U.S. and Canada by August, a spokesperson for Ford Canada told the CBC in an email Monday.

In a memo to employees, Monday, CEO Jim Hackett said the fourth wave of the restructuring will start on Tuesday, with the majority of cuts being finished by May 24.

To succeed in our competitive industry, and position Ford to win in a fast-changing future, we must reduce bureaucracy…and cut costs. - Jim Hackett, Ford CEO

""To succeed in our competitive industry, and position Ford to win in a fast-changing future, we must reduce bureaucracy, empower managers, speed decision making and focus on the most valuable work, and cost cuts,"" Hackett wrote.

In the U.S., about 1,500 white-collar employees have left the company voluntarily since the restructuring began last year, some taking buyouts. About 300 have been laid off already, with another 500 layoffs starting this week.

Most of Ford's white-collar workers are in and around the company's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters.

2nd recent set of layoffs

It's the second set of layoffs for Detroit-area automakers, even though the companies are making healthy profits. Sales in the U.S., where the automakers get most of their revenue, have fallen slightly but still are strong.

In November, General Motors announced it would shed up to 14,000 workers as it cut expenses to prepare for a shift to electric and autonomous vehicles.

The layoffs included closure of five factories in the U.S. and Canada and cuts of another 8,000 white-collar workers worldwide. About 5,000 blue-collar positions were cut, but most of laid-off factory workers in the U.S. will be placed at other plants mainly that build trucks and SUVs.

Both companies have said the cuts are needed to prepare for the future, because companies face huge capital expenditures to update their current vehicles and develop them for the future.

The cuts brought withering criticism of GM from U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress, especially the closing of a small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio. Trump campaigned on bringing factory jobs back to the industrial Midwest. GM has since announced a possible deal to sell the Lordstown plant to a startup electric vehicle maker, but it hasn't been finalized.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cannabis-edibles-study-dalhousie-university-sylvain-charlebois-1.5128514,Someone is triggered lmao,-4.0,45.0,"Canadians' interest in cannabis-infused food is waning even as edibles are expected to become legal by mid-October, according to a new study that looks at changing attitudes toward marijuana.

The study out of Dalhousie University also found that 60 per cent of cannabis users continue to buy from the same supplier as they did before smoking pot became legal last year.

""The reason why they did that is for convenience, quality and most importantly price,"" lead author Sylvain Charlebois told CBC's Maritime Noon on Thursday.

""The price of cannabis in the black market is actually much lower, much more affordable than the legal cannabis.""

Charlebois said he believes when edibles become legal, it could actually continue to fuel the black market.

""The regulatory framework presented by Health Canada is so restrictive that it won't entice manufacturers in Canada to produce edibles,"" he said.

""If there is appetite to consume edibles — no pun — people will actually look for that product. And we may actually see more products being imported into Canada illegally to support that demand.""

Drop in legalization support

The study surveyed 1,051 Canadians over four days last month. The estimated margin of error is 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20. The aim was to compare attitudes before and after October 2018 legalization.

It found the number of Canadians in support of legalization in general fell by 19 per cent — and uncertainty about legalization rose by seven per cent. Only about six per cent of people reported starting using since legalization.

Of the 68 per cent of Canadians who were in favour of legalizing cannabis in 2017, 93 per cent of that group were willing to try an edible product. That dropped to 70 per cent in April.

""That's a significant drop,"" Charlebois said, adding it's probably for a number of different reasons — including media reports of specific incidents, such as when a four-year-old girl in Nova Scotia was hospitalized after accidentally ingesting cannabis-infused chocolate.

The study also found that Canadians are worried about edibles posing a greater risk to children (64 per cent) and pets (54 per cent).

Charlebois said he believes Health Canada has been focusing on mitigating the risk of cannabis products and not actually educating people.

""We figured out that Canadians are mostly cannabinoid illiterate,"" he said.

People are also concerned about privacy: almost half said they're uncertain about their co-workers knowing they use cannabis recreationally.

The study also found edibles carry less stigma than other forms of cannabis, and 20 per cent of respondents said while they don't use cannabis now, they might consider edibles once they become legal.

Charlebois said in Colorado, where marijuana is also legal, 50 per cent of all sales are edibles.

""The edible market in particular really has got a lot of people to consume cannabis, when really they didn't when only the dry stuff was legal. So we are expecting that to happen in Canada as well,"" he said.

While stigma wasn't something addressed in the 2017 study, Charlebois said the most recent findings suggest more than half of people believe retail facilities should be kept out of residential neighbourhoods. Less than 20 per cent said they're worried about being seen buying cannabis.

""The stigma was not as high or as strong as we thought it would be. However we have a long way to go from seeing cannabis become socially normalized in Canada,"" Charlebois said.

""And with restrictions, and in particular restrictions affecting edibles, that process may take much longer than expected."""

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

Looks like this family is fitting in just fine.,17.0,205.0,"Police north of Toronto have charged a father and son after officers found explosive materials and a detonator device at a home in Richmond Hill, Ont.

Reza Mohammadiasl, 47, and his son Mahyar, 18, were arrested on Monday and charged with one count each of possession of an explosive device following a search of their home. Both men were scheduled to appear in Newmarket court on Tuesday.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the arrests and charges are a local matter that concerns York police and there is no known connection to national security.

""There is no known connection to any issue related to national security,"" he said in Ottawa. ""It is a local policing matter. Obviously they've made arrests, they've laid charges, and it's up to them to comment further.""

Border agents tipped off police

York Regional Police said the investigation began last Thursday when they received information about a person being investigated by the United States Customs and Border Protection and the Canada Border Services Agency.

On Friday, police executed a search warrant at a home on Larratt Lane, near Bathurst Street and Elgin Mills Road West, and discovered explosive materials. Police did not specify what exactly the materials were or how much was removed. They said chemicals were also seized.

Ontario Provincial Police, along with the York police's explosives detection unit, helped to removed the materials.

As a precaution, police practically shut down the street on Friday, forcing neighbours from their homes and restricting vehicle and pedestrian traffic as officers carried out their work. Neighbours have since been allowed back into their homes, police said.

Despite, evacuation orders being lifted and the suburban street returning to normal, residents say they have been left feeling uneasy.

Jill Garazi, who has lived on Larratt Lane for 16 years, said the experience was ""very stressful and traumatic.""

""You don't know what's going on, you don't know if your house is going to blow up, you don't know anything,"" Garazi said.

Area resident Rajneesh Bir said crime was so uncommon in the neighbourhood that even minor robberies were rare.

""Suddenly we hear about explosives and wow. It's very scary,"" Bir said.

'It's a very serious case for sure'

Const. Andy Pattenden, spokesperson for the York Regional Police, said officers are investigating how the materials got into the home, why they were there and what the accused planned to do with them.

""We don't often see things like this. It's a very serious case for sure. The charge, possession of explosives, is a very serious charge,"" Pattenden said.

""Thankfully, nobody was injured in this particular case. But there's lots more to this investigation. That's why we really need some tips and help from the public as to how these materials got there, why they were there and what these two people were up to.""

Police had a presence at the home on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Pattenden said.

In a news release on Tuesday, police said dangerous chemicals being stored in a home can pose serious risks, including fires and explosions.

They urged members of public to call police if they see any suspicious activity, notice chemical odours, or unusual storage or stockpiling of chemicals and to take precautions.

Hazardous materials should never be eaten, inhaled or consumed, and even slightly inhaling a chemical can cause serious injury, they said. If a material is considered hazardous, police urge the public to leave the area and call 911.

""If you witness anyone dumping material that appears to be hazardous waste, get the best description as possible and call police immediately. Never approach the suspects,"" police said.

Police would like to hear from anyone who knows the two accused or who has information that may help investigators."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cra-kmpg-settlement-taxes-1.5154610,You've never been a contractor obviously.,12.0,145.0,"The Canada Revenue Agency has once again made a secret out-of-court settlement with wealthy KPMG clients caught using what the CRA itself had alleged was a ""grossly negligent"" offshore ""sham"" set up to avoid detection by tax authorities, CBC's The Fifth Estate and Radio-Canada's Enquête have learned.

This, despite the Liberal government's vow to crack down on high-net-worth taxpayers who used the now-infamous Isle of Man scheme. The scheme orchestrated by accounting giant KPMG enabled clients to dodge tens of millions of dollars in taxes in Canada by making it look as if multimillionaires had given away their fortunes to anonymous overseas shell companies and get their investment income back as tax-free gifts.

KPMG is a global network of accounting and auditing firms headquartered out of the Netherlands and is one of the top firms in Canada.

""Tax cheats can no longer hide,"" National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier promised in 2017.

Now, Tax Court documents obtained by CBC News/Radio-Canada show two members of the Cooper family in Victoria, as well as the estate of the late patriarch Peter Cooper, reached an out-of-court settlement on May 24 over their involvement in the scheme.

Details of the settlement and even minutes of the meetings discussing it are under wraps. A CBC News/Radio-Canada reporter who showed up to one such meeting this spring left after realizing it was closed to the public.

Journalists discovered references to the final settlement agreement in Tax Court documents only by chance.

CRA cites privacy in keeping settlement details secret

The Canada Revenue Agency says strict privacy provisions of Canadian tax law make it difficult to disclose minutes describing individual taxpayer information.

The Isle of Man tax dodge had been active as far back as 1999 and, according to documents filed in Tax Court by the CRA in 2015, had ""intended to deceive"" federal regulators.

Still, significant details of the scheme remain a mystery, including the role played by the KPMG's senior executives. With no public trial, those details may continue to remain secret.

Toby Sanger, executive director of the advocacy group Canadians for Tax Fairness, says the CRA should never have agreed to settle the case.

""I think it's outrageous,"" he said. ""We've had a lot of tough talk and promises from this minister about how they will crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy and corporations, but unfortunately, we've seen no evidence of this so far.""

Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier said in an email statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête that while she cannot comment on specific cases, she finds the lack of transparency about settlements brokered by her agency ""problematic.""

""I have instructed the CRA to review its processes to allow for more transparency with respect to the reasons for which a settlement is reached,"" she said.

KPMG took 15% cut of taxes dodged

One member of the Cooper family, Marshall Cooper, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s and that it was KPMG that came up with the offshore tax plan.

Documents show KPMG planned to take a 15 per cent cut of the taxes dodged, including $300,000 from the Cooper family. Internal records show the scheme was marketed across the country, with successful KPMG sales agents and accountants referred to as product ""champions.""

Marshall Cooper, pictured, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s. (Facebook)

In all, more than 20 wealthy families participated in the offshore scheme.

Two years ago, Lebouthillier issued a news release outlining her intention to clamp down on the KPMG scheme, publicly stating that those involved could even face criminal charges over possible ""tax fraud.""

""The case of KPMG is before the courts right now, and we continue to pursue action against KPMG,"" Lebouthillier said in 2017 in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""We will see this to the end as Canadians have asked us to do.""

She said at the time that her government took the matter ""very seriously.""

""Those who choose to participate in these schemes must face the consequences of their actions,"" she said in a separate statement.

Yet more than two years after that pledge, participants in the KPMG scheme, namely, members of the Cooper family, were offered a secret out-of-court settlement.

In her statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête this week, Lebouthillier said the decision to settle was not hers to make and that she had instructed the CRA to review its settlements to ""allow for more transparency.""

Minister says 'systemic changes' are coming

To ""ensure integrity of our tax system,"" Lebouthillier said, out-of-court settlements are made by the CRA and the Department of Justice ""at arm's length"" from the minister and the minister's office.

""Canadians deserve a fair and equitable tax system, and we will continue to make systemic changes within the CRA to make sure that this is the case,"" she said in her statement this week.

CBC News/Radio-Canada first revealed four years ago that KPMG, one of the largest accounting firms in Canada, with tens of millions in federal contracts, had for years been running a massive offshore tax dodge for wealthy clients it had kept hidden from federal investigators.

The Trudeau government's previous tough talk on the so-called sham had come after a document leaked to The Fifth Estate/Enquête showed the CRA itself had offered a secret ""no penalties"" amnesty in May 2015 to many of the KPMG clients involved in the scheme.

The CRA offered to have them simply pay the back taxes owed — but with the condition they not tell the public about the offer.

Liberal MPs halted a parliamentary finance committee investigation in 2016 after KPMG argued the investigation could prejudice court cases. Now, it looks like those court cases might never happen. (CBC)

Stung by those revelations, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in 2017 that the government had learned a lesson from the KPMG affair and promised to do a ""better job of getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.""

Since then, the Liberal government vowed to make sure those kinds of offshore tax dodges were in the past.

In fact, it was concerns over future KPMG court cases that prompted the Liberal-dominated House of Commons finance committee to shut down its own investigation into the embattled accounting firm back in 2016.

Documents had already begun to emerge detailing the extent to which KPMG was helping clients not only dodge taxes but also hide money from potential creditors, including circumventing the Canadian Divorce Act by ""protecting"" assets from ex-spouses.

Lawyers for KPMG had argued that the ongoing finance committee investigation could prejudice cases before the court.

Several KPMG executives had been named to testify in the spring of 2016, but Liberal MPs voted to shut down the inquiry, arguing that any more testimony and documents should be produced in court and not in Parliament.

Now, it appears that those future court cases cited as a reason for shutting down the investigation might never materialize.

The Fifth Estate and Enquête also later revealed that in June 2016, around the same time the Liberal MPs shut down their investigation, a former senior KPMG executive was appointed to the Liberal Party's national board of directors.

""There is no reason why the finance committee shouldn't restart their hearings,"" Canadians for Tax Fairness's Sanger said.

Settlements offer 'substantial savings to the public'

Sanger said it all seems like a Liberal ""coverup"" to close down the KPMG investigation.

Canadians still do not know who were the key people at KPMG involved in running the investigation, for example, how high up it went within the organization, or all the names of the wealthy clients who participated.

Max Weder, the lawyer for the Cooper family, said he ""can't comment on the settlement.""

Documents show the family paid virtually no tax over a span of eight years — and even obtained federal and provincial tax credits — despite receiving nearly $6 million from an offshore company worth $26 million that KPMG helped set up.

KPMG has always maintained the scheme was legal. The firm's lawyers claimed any money the Coopers received were gifts and therefore non-taxable. Nevertheless, KPMG now says it would not set up this type of offshore structure anymore.

For its part, the CRA said that the settlement was made in accordance with the law and is ""supported by the facts of this particular case."" The agency also said it ""maximized revenue"" by making a decision to settle out of court, instead of facing an uncertain ruling in Tax Court.

Harold Verge, 72, is blind. His wife also suffers from a series of debilitating health issues. Last month, they lost the home they owned for the past 24 years when it was sold, against their will, they say.

The agent, Vince Iannello, while not denying any of the specific allegations, says he has ""never wavered"" from caring for his clients. For its part, Royal LePage says it is investigating the Verges' case.

But the Verges say their ordeal began when Iannello, a realtor with Royal LePage Your Community Realty in Vaughan, offered to help the couple renew their two mortgages, according to Verge.

""When my wife was trying to read the paperwork, he kept saying, 'Don't read it, sign it, sign it,'"" Verge recalled Iannello telling her.

""We thought we were only signing to renew our mortgages.""

Days after the mortgages were renewed, the Verges say Iannello returned to their home and told them it was going to be sold. CBC News has reviewed the mortgage renewal documents, both in the Verges' home and at their lawyer's office.

""He said he's going to sell our house whether we like it or not, because we're not allowed to own our house after you're 65 years old,"" Verge said.

""He said he had to do his part to sell it.""

There are no laws in Canada preventing seniors from owning property.

""I think he tricked us into it. My wife feels the same way. He tricked us,"" Verge said about listing the home for sale.

Iannello also allegedly told the couple his wife had just given birth to a third child, and that the realtor needed money, according to Verge.

Last month, the Verges moved into a small rented bungalow several kilometres away after their home was sold.

""I wake up in the middle of the night tormented and in fear,"" Verge told CBC News.

""What's going to happen next?"" he said, pointing to stacks of boxes piled high in the living room of the rented bungalow.

""I'm afraid if I unpack everything, and the landlord says you have to get out, you have to move, we've got to worry about packing and moving again,"" he said.

Iannello paid their first and last months' rent once their home was sold.

Vince Iannello is a real estate agent with Royal LePage Your Community In brokerage.

'They were fooled,' lawyer says

Verge and his wife Florence bought their 2.5-storey, semi-detached home at 42 Connaught Ave, in the Queen Street East and Greenwood Avenue area, in 1995.

The couple was in good standing financially, despite their modest incomes and their two mortgages.

Harold Verge weaves cane to repair seats and backrests on antique chairs. Florence Verge retired after working 30 years at a McDonald's restaurant.

Iannello declined to answer numerous questions from CBC News. In an emailed statement he said he wasn't able to due to legal reasons.

""I was surprised to be contacted by the CBC regarding these allegations,"" he wrote.

Commitment to Verges 'is genuine,' Iannello says

""My commitment to the Verges is genuine and I am disappointed that no further details can be provided by me at this time due to the potential for litigation,"" his email reads.

The Verges, with the help of a concerned friend, have since hired a lawyer to look into the situation.

""They were fooled,"" Charles Wagman, the Verges' lawyer, told CBC News.

""There was pressure because of the idea they had to sell, that they weren't entitled at law to own property anymore. That's what the Verges say motivated them to sell.""

Wagman says the home was also sold for below market value.

""It appears the property was grossly undersold.""

In a complaint to the brokerage, Wagman accuses Iannello of negligence, noting the realtor didn't list the Verges' home on the Multiple Listing Service. The website is widely used by realtors to list homes for sale and attract a larger pool of potential buyers.

Instead, Iannello sent an email to other agents at the Royal LePage Your Community Realty brokerage letting them know the Verge's home was available.

CBC News obtained a copy of the email. In it, Iannello claimed the Verges were ""motivated sellers.""

""They were the opposite of motivated sellers. They didn't want to sell,"" said Wagman.

House sold for less than any other on the street recently

Nine days after being listed, the Verges' home was sold with the help of one of Iannello's colleagues at Royal LePage Your Community Realty.

Realtor Leslie-Jane Patterson's clients bought the Verges' home for $675 000.

In an email that Patterson wrote to another potential buyer, she noted the home had been appraised at $750 000. She described the home as being in ""rough shape"" but added it had upgraded hydro service, water systems and a newer furnace.

Patterson described the Verges' home as an ""opportunity"" and told her client, two other 2.5 storey, semi-detached homes on the same street recently sold for $880 000 and $886 000 each.

""I have zero vested interest in this property other than helping these poor souls that appear to be being taken advantage of. I had no idea of the situation when I took my investors through the property today — if anything I was told not to engage in conversing with the vendor, oops!!!"" she wrote in the email.

It's not clear who Patterson believed was taking advantage of the Verges.

She declined to respond to specific questions from CBC News, and hung up when reached by phone.

In a later email to CBC News, she provided no specifics about the situation.

""Nothing brings me more joy than helping my clients successfully navigate their home sales and purchases. I take great pride and care in my work. I respect the privacy of my clients and it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any additional manner,"" she wrote.

Patterson, Iannello and the brokerage pocketed more than $33 000 in commissions from the sale.

In his email, Iannello suggested he did nothing wrong.

""I have never wavered from always caring about the well being of my clients. Until this is resolved, I will not have an opportunity to discuss this further,"" he wrote.

'Looking into the details' of Verges' case, Royal LePage says

Representatives from Royal LePage's corporate head office also declined to answer any specific questions about the home sale.

In an emailed statement, the company's director of communications suggested the matter is being investigated.

""Royal LePage's brand is built on integrity, a strong commitment to the community and the best interests of consumers,"" Sarah Louise Gardiner wrote.

""Our brokerages are independently owned and operated and we are looking into the details of this specific situation. We cannot discuss it further at this time.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-adds-record-jobs-april-1.5130682,But was it accurate?,4.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/national-gun-trafficking-straw-buying-smuggling-firearms-1.5126228,Yeah there are actually quite a few. There are towns bisected by the border and some unmanned crossings where while there is a telephone booth thing to scan your passport I could see how if you didn’t know you could drive right by.,9.0,34.0,"Police are scrambling to keep pace with criminals who are coming up with creative ways to supply Canada's black market with firearms.

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says a gun smuggling 'pipeline' moves firearms across the border from the U.S. into Canada illegally. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Wes Winkel, is the owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to pick out a possible straw buyer, and law enforcement authorities have been slow to identify them based on sales records. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

""We want to start getting people hearing our voices.""

According to Indigenous Services Canada, 57 First Nations across Canada were under long-term drinking water advisories, including four in Manitoba, as of April 27.

TORONTO – The Ontario government says it plans to join British Columbia’s proposed class action lawsuit against dozens of opioid manufacturers.

Attorney General Caroline Mulroney says the province will introduce legislation that, if passed, would enable Ontario’s participation in the suit launched late last year.

She says Ontario would invest any potential awards won from the litigation into frontline mental health and addiction services.

British Columbia filed the proposed class action against dozens of pharmaceutical companies in a bid to recoup the health-care costs associated with opioid addiction.

The untested suit alleges the companies falsely marketed opioids as less addictive than other pain drugs and helped trigger an overdose crisis that has killed thousands since OxyContin was introduced to the Canadian market in 1996.

It names the maker of OxyContin – Purdue Pharma Inc. – as well as other major drug manufacturers, and also targets pharmacies, including Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. and its owner Loblaw Companies Ltd., claiming they should have known the quantities of opioids they were distributing exceeded any legitimate market.

Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jason-kenney-primary-residence-mp-expense-1.5120002,"Legal barely, ethical, not at all.",6.0,27.0,"A federal committee that oversees House of Commons expenses has cleared Alberta Premier Jason Kenney of any wrongdoing for claiming a room in his mother's basement as his primary residence while he sat as a Conservative MP.

House of Commons expenditure reports show Kenney collected secondary-residence subsidies in Ottawa between 2012 and 2015 of about $10,000 each year as an MP for Calgary Midnapore, while his mother's retirement-community bungalow in Calgary was listed as his address with Elections Canada.

Daniel Paquette, the chief financial officer of the House of Commons, said Kenney, whose United Conservative Party won a majority in last month's provincial election, met all the requirements that were necessary at the time of his claims.

'Partisan considerations'

While conservative MPs on the Board of Internal Economy were satisfied with the ruling, they called the process a partisan attack and warned they could dig into historical expense claims, as well.

The Board of Internal Economy is responsible for the financial and administrative affairs of the House of Commons, and sets budgets for MP office spending, hospitality, travel expenses and security.

""I think, quite frankly, this board should be very concerned that this process was engaged for what can only be determined to have been partisan considerations to affect the ability of Mr. Kenney to conduct his campaign to become premier of Alberta,"" said MP Mark Strahl.

""So, quite frankly, I think this was a very disturbing case, because we can all play this game. We can go back to times when members of the Liberal Party were found to have been illegally claiming housing allowances,"" Strahl said.

Conservative MP Candice Bergen echoed her colleague's concerns.

""I think we have to think very, very seriously about what happened and how we were a part of it,"" she said.

The Board of Internal Economy is the governing body of the House of Commons and is responsible for expense policies. It is non-partisan.

Allegations raised before campaign

The allegations that Kenney was improperly claiming expenses was first raised by lawyer Kyle Morrow in January in the lead-up to the Alberta election campaign.

Morrow ran for the Alberta Liberals in the riding of Lacombe-Ponoka in the 2012 provincial election, which prompted the Kenney campaign to dismiss him as a ""failed Liberal candidate.""

The parliamentary investigation was initiated when Ontario Liberal MP Jennifer O'Connell formally requested it.

At the board hearing on Thursday, government house whip Mark Holland said he believes the investigation was important, even though it found no fault.

""I understand the concern. I would just simply state that the process of verifying, particularly when in a public forum and there are questions about expenses, there is an important need to verify the veracity of those expenses sometimes,"" he said.

Holland said he is satisfied with the findings."

I was replying to someone saying that Islam was incompatible with western values.  I think perhaps the point I was making got lost when their comment got deleted.  I assumed you were defending them.",1.0,165.0,"A lawyer representing a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after she spent eight years on death row in Pakistan says she has arrived in Canada.

Pakistani officials and others involved in the case said Wednesday that Asia Bibi had left Pakistan to be reunited with her daughters in Canada, where they had been granted asylum. Her lawyer, Saif-ul Malook, said she had already arrived in Canada.

Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2009 after a quarrel with a fellow farmworker. Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction last year and she had been in protective custody since then.

Islamic extremists have rioted over the case and threatened to kill her. The same radical Islamists, many of whom have been jailed for their threats, also urged the overthrow of the government following Bibi's acquittal.

Wilson Chawdhry of the British Pakistani Christian Association told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he received a text message from a British diplomat saying ""Asia is out."" A close friend of Bibi also confirmed that she had left the country, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

A statement from the association says it received confirmation around 8 p.m. ET Tuesday that Bibi ""had safely exited Pakistan.""

""Asia Bibi bravely held on to her faith through the most brutal of incarcerations that involved her having access to sunlight for two hours per month,"" the statement says. ""Now she finally travels to Canada to be reunited with her children.""

Chowdhry said in the statement released by the association that Bibi is ""unwell"" after suffering a decade of isolation both in and out of captivity.

""She must be treated with utmost care and receive appropriate medical care now she is free,"" he said.

Officials at Pakistan's interior and foreign ministries also confirmed her departure, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would not discuss the case Wednesday.

""I have no comment,"" Trudeau said. ""Obviously, there are sensitive privacy issues and security issues on this and unfortunately I can't comment at this time.""

Global Affairs Canada said Wednesday it ""has no comment on this matter."" Trudeau said last November that Canada was then in talks with the Pakistani government about Bibi.

The friend, who last spoke to her on Tuesday, said Bibi and her husband Ashiq Masih had spent the last several weeks getting their documents in order. He said she was longing to see her daughters, with whom she talked almost daily from her secure location, protected by Pakistani security forces.

Chawdhry said he had been in regular contact with Bibi's husband throughout the ordeal as well as with several diplomats involved in international efforts to get her to safety.

The case has brought international attention to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, which carries an automatic death penalty. The mere suspicion of blasphemy against Islam is enough to ignite mob lynchings in the country. The accusation of blasphemy has also been used to intimidate religious minorities and to settle scores.

Radical Islamists have made the punishment of blasphemy a major rallying cry, bringing tens of thousands into the streets and paralyzing major cities.

Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, has been celebrated as a martyr by hardliners since he was hanged for the killing, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Pakistan's minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated later that year after demanding justice for Bibi.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed not to be intimidated by the rioters, saying the rule of law would decide Bibi's fate. But she was denied permission to leave the country for several months until sentiments cooled.

A three-judge Supreme Court panel in January cleared Bibi's final legal hurdle when they ruled there was no compelling reason to overturn the court's earlier acquittal. The judges accused those who charged Bibi with blasphemy of committing perjury, but said they would not be tried because of the sensitivity of the case. The judges upheld the blasphemy law."

Provincial officials have told the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine (OIRM) that its $5 million in annual funding from the province will cease next March.

The Toronto-based institute provides grants to help Ontario researchers turn their their stem cell discoveries into treatments that are both medically and commercially viable.

The government's decision to terminate the funding is ""extremely short-sighted and uninformed,"" said Bernard Thébaud, a neonatal researcher who received funding from OIRM to explore the use of stem cells in preventing complications from premature birth.

""If [the government] would do a careful analysis, they would realize this is a worthwhile investment,"" said Thébaud, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and professor of pediatrics at the University of Ottawa.

Bernard Thébaud, a neonatologist at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and a senior scientist with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, says if the government would do a 'careful analysis' it would realize stem-cell research is a 'worthwhile investment.' (Canadian Lung Association)

His work has shown that stem cells isolated from the umbilical cord have the potential to prevent brain and lung damage in premature babies and promote healthy development of the organs as the children age.

""We believe this [research] could be a game-changer for these pre-term babies and could substantially improve their outcomes,"" Thébaud said Wednesday in an interview.

The funding to OIRM came from Ontario's Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. The minister responsible, Todd Smith, said the researchers can turn to the private sector.

""The previous government was throwing millions of dollars around like crazy and they were not holding anyone accountable as to how they were spending that money,"" Smith told reporters Wednesday at Queen's Park.

""What we've heard from the life-sciences sector is that a lot of these organizations don't actually need government money, that the private sector will step up,"" said Smith.

But scientists in the stem-cell field say the private sector is not willing to invest until their studies reach a late phase. To get there, they say government funding is crucial.

""We pick the really outstanding projects that have true potential and we fund them to the point where they can attract additional funding and then begin to move forward,"" said Duncan Stewart, president and scientific director of OIRM.

""Without a catalyst to kick-start the process, then it's not going to happen.""

The scientists see a bitter irony in the government's move, since stem cell research was born in Ontario. James Till and Ernest McCulloch discovered the existence of stem cells in 1961 at the Toronto-based Ontario Cancer Institute.

""It's very deflating, it's very disappointing to learn that this is going to not continue,"" said Stewart.

""The concern is that many great ideas, great technologies that could have blossomed into successful new opportunities commercially and new therapies for our patients just aren't going to move forward.""

Duncan Stewart, president and scientific director of the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine, is hopeful the government can be persuaded to renew OIRM's funding instead of stopping it. (Mike Crawley/CBC)

Research funded by OIRM attracted a $225-million investment by pharmaceutical giant Bayer and venture capital firm Versant Ventures to create BlueRock Therapeutics, now headquartered in Toronto. The company aims to treat heart disease and degenerative brain diseases.

""We were very excited about what we were able to accomplish with relatively modest funding,"" said Stewart.

The institute was created in 2014, with a promise from the Wynne government of $25 million over five years.

Stewart said he is hopeful the government can be persuaded to renew OIRM's funding instead of stopping it.

""We have a year, and a year is a long time in politics,"" said Stewart.

""We're hoping to use that time to try to position ourselves to continue in some way. Unfortunately, we have no idea what will happen after that."""

Curling has been a staple of Canadian winters for decades, but there are some things that have changed over the years — like a skip sliding down the ice with a cigarette in his mouth.

Orest (The Big O) Meleschuk knows a little about smoking on the international stage, because he is the skip in a video that As It Happens recently dug up from the CBC Archives.

In it, a younger Meleschuk can be seen throwing an extremely important rock for Team Canada at the 1972 Silver Broom world championship in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria — complete with a lit dart in his mouth.

""Well you know, if it sits in an ashtray it's going to burn out and I was quite frugal in those days,"" Meleschuk told As It Happens host Carol Off from his home in Selkirk, Man.

""I didn't want to waste it.""

That throw by Meleschuk began one of the most contentious plays in curling history — known as the ""Great Kicked Rock Caper"".

The Canadian team needed two points to force another end against Team U.S.A., or the game was over and Canada would not hold their title for the fifth consecutive year.

As Meleschuk explains, he knocked the U.S. rock out but the Canadian's tying rock rolled farther than he had anticipated. Thinking they had won, the U.S. skip Bob LaBonte ran onto the ice, slipped and kicked the Canadian rock in premature celebration. ​

Canada ended up winning the match in an extra end.

'Beer out of a stein'

Meleschuk says he can't remember exactly how Team Canada celebrated their championship win, but since the match was held in Bavaria it was probably with a beer as opposed to their regular drink — whiskey straight.

""I drank my beer out of a stein, this way they didn't know whether it was milk or water or beer.""

Meleschuk remembered how popular smoking was back in the '70s and how much rinks have changed.

""A lot of curlers smoked. [There were] ashtrays on the boards and back of the ends. Ashtrays all over the place,"" he said.

But he admits that after watching video footage after the event of himself curling with a cigarette, he was a ""little bit embarrassed"" and decided to quit smoking.

""I quit after that year because I was watching a few films and I thought it was so disgusting that I thought I better quit,"" he said.

A broom a game

Meleschuk said he is impressed with how far the equipment has come in the last 40 years — most notably the brooms.

""In those days ... a broomer used to go through a broom almost every two games,"" he said.

""They really go through a broom in a game but we couldn't afford to buy that many brooms so you kept the broom as long as you could.""

That's because the brooms were made out of straw, as opposed to the squeegee-like brushes that are used now. The brooms would leave the sweepers with blisters all over their hands — something Meleschuk doesn't think curlers could handle now.

""I don't think any of the brushers now could flop that broom around from one end to the other for 12 ends, which we used to play,"" he said.

It also meant that there was straw all over the ice, something that could impede the rock if the house sweeper didn't do their job properly.

When it was pointed out to him that the cigarette ash on the ice may have also been a factor, Meleschuk laughed.

""That's why we used to have burnt rocks, because of the hot ashes."""

Roughly 1,100 people, including more than 800 students from the Seven Oaks School Division, took part, organizers estimate.

Carrying signs, the demonstrators walked from city hall down Main Street to Portage Avenue, and then up Memorial Boulevard, before ending at the Manitoba Legislative Building.

Eric Jasysyn helped organize the walk and hoped to get the attention of politicians.

""The Indigenous communities have been suffering for so long and it's time to start seeing change,"" said Jasysyn, a Grade 12 student from Seven Oaks Met School.

Jasysyn points specifically to the situation at Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, which provides Winnipeg with its drinking water, yet doesn't have a water treatment facility and has been under a years-long boil water advisory.

""It is time to start seeing change and it's time to start getting them the water that they deserve,"" he said.

""We want to start getting people hearing our voices.""

According to Indigenous Services Canada, 57 First Nations across Canada were under long-term drinking water advisories, including four in Manitoba, as of April 27.

Indigenous Services Canada has set a date of March 2021 to have all long-term water advisories lifted on Canadian First Nations, and says 85 of the advisories have been lifted since November 2015.

""There are communities across Canada that don't have access to clean drinking water — that's a big problem.""

""Chasing environmentalists might play well politically, but it's not actually relevant to the discussion that Alberta and Canada need to be having,"" added Simon Dyer of the clean-energy think tank Pembina Institute.

Both groups have been singled out by Kenney as examples of ones distorting the truth about the impact of the oilsands.

The premier has said government staff will be tasked with responding quickly to what he calls myths and lies. Kenney has also promised to fund lawsuits against offending environmentalists and to call a public inquiry into the role of money from U.S. foundations.

""Stay tuned,"" Energy Minister Sonya Savage said Tuesday. ""We'll have something to talk about next week.""

Environmental groups have already been discussing informally what the United Conservative government might have in mind and how they should react.

""We've been contacted,"" said Devon Page of Eco Justice, an environmental law firm. ""We've been saying to the groups, 'We're here. We'll respond and represent you as we have in the past.'

""What we're trying hard not to do is to do what I think the Kenney government wants, which is to get distracted.""

Dyer and Stewart said their groups are about 85 per cent funded by Canadians. The Pembina Institute was founded in Drayton Valley, Alta., and its headquarters remain in Calgary.

A lot of the rhetoric around our work and our contribution to Alberta has been based on complete misinformation. - Simon Dyer, Pembina Institute

Both called the war room political posturing aimed at the party's base.

""A lot of the rhetoric around our work and our contribution to Alberta has been based on complete misinformation,"" said Dyer, who noted Pembina has worked with virtually every major energy company in the province.

Stewart called the threats a rerun of the 2012 campaign against environmental groups fuelled by the right-wing The Rebel media group and led by Stephen Harper's federal Conservatives.

""We learned to play rope-a-dope,"" said Stewart. ""Stephen Harper was our best recruiter.

""We had people contacting us saying 'how do I lie down in front of a bulldozer?' We don't usually get a lot of those calls but we were getting a lot of those calls.""

Each group is confident in the accuracy of the facts it cites. Dyer said Pembina research has been used by investors, academics and governments.

'Not interested in polarizing this debate'

Stewart said the issue isn't facts, but how they are understood.

""Often what it is is a disagreement over which fact is important. Industry will say 'we're reducing emissions per barrel.' We'll say 'emissions are going up.' Both statements are true and it depends which you think is more important.""

Cara Zwibel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the Kenney government must tread carefully. It's okay to defend your position, but not to threaten, she said.

""If we're talking about initiating lawsuits against individuals or organizations on the basis of speaking out on issues of public importance, then that raises serious problems,"" she said. ""Then we have a much more obvious impact and potential violation on freedom of expression.""

Ward said any cases the government funds would also be tough to win.

He must walk the walk as well",1.0,16.0,"OTTAWA—The federal government is still weighing whether Huawei can help build Canada’s 5G infrastructure as the U.S. took one step closer to banning the Chinese telecom giant.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Wednesday that the government continues to review “all potential suppliers” for Canada’s next generation of wireless networks from both a technological and national security perspective.

Goodale was speaking just before President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk, paving the way for a ban on doing business with China’s Huawei Technologies.

“We obviously pay careful attention to what our allies are saying and doing. Some have expressed views, others have not,” Goodale said outside the House of Commons.

“We’ll take all that into account, but we want to make the very best decision for Canada with respect to the technology and also on national security. Our national security will not be compromised.”

The U.S. has actively lobbied allies to keep Huawei technology out of American networks, suggesting it could be used to spy for Beijing.

Huawei has aggressively and repeatedly denied allegations it poses a national security threat.

Canada has been reviewing Huawei’s involvement in the country’s 5G infrastructure — “5G” refers to the fifth generation of wireless technology, with each generation increasing how fast data can be transferred — for months.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said a government led by him would ban Huawei on national security grounds.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

“I believe there are many security concerns as it relates to Huawei and the development of Canada’s 5G. We know the government of China has acknowledged its role in certain cyber-attacks,” Scheer told reporters Wednesday.

“It’s up to the government of Canada to protect not just the personal information of Canadians but also the integrity of Canadian institutions.”

Trump’s order would have little impact on the main wireless carriers in the U.S., which do not employ Huawei products in their networks. According to Reuters, only about 25 per cent of smaller U.S. carriers use equipment from Huawei and another Chinese supplier, ZTE.

But a move by Trump to officially ban all Huawei products could be another salvo in the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.

A U.S. ban would also put constraints on what Ottawa can do. In an interview with Sky News last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo strongly suggested that the U.S. could limit intelligence sharing with countries that allow Huawei technology in their networks.

“We don’t believe you can have those technologies in your systems and still have a trusted network,” Pompeo

“But the United States, for its part, will only participate in trusted networks. We will only share America’s information with those networks that we are confident aren’t under the control of China . . . There’s really risk if countries choose that path, that we won’t be able to participate in those networks.”

A breakdown in intelligence sharing with the U.S. would have serious ramifications for Canada, which is a net importer of intelligence in the Five Eyes alliance, and is likely a consideration in the federal government’s review of the 5G file.

Goodale wouldn’t say Wednesday when that review will be released. Bloomberg News, citing unnamed government officials, reported last week that the Liberals could delay a decision until after October’s federal election.

In a recent application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Shaw's home satellite service advised the broadcast regulator it wanted to terminate the Local Television Satellite Solution (LTSS).

The LTSS provided minimum access to Canadian television services, including CBC, Radio-Canada, CTV, Global and Citytv. It was only available free if a household was in an area that previously received over-the-air signals free through an antenna, and lost them in 2011 when transmission converted to digital.

Unless I'm willing to give up some of the rent money, I have to accept that I will no longer be able to receive, as a Canadian, CBC programming. - Doug Grisack, LTSS subscriber in Lethbridge, Alta.

That conversion removed television service for rural Canadians across the country and viewers in both small cities and metro areas as large as Saskatoon or London, Ont.

Lethbridge, Alta., resident Doug Grisack is concerned he'll lose access to programming as a result of Shaw's request, unless he opens up his wallet for pay television service.

""Unless I'm willing to give up some of the rent money, I have to accept that I will no longer be able to receive, as a Canadian, CBC programming,"" said Grisack, who has sent his concerns to the CRTC.

""I think as a Canadian taxpayer, I should have some sort of access to the national programming of the CBC.""

Service a condition of Shaw acquiring Global

Providing the free satellite service was part of a deal Shaw made with the broadcast regulator when it acquired Global TV in 2010. The CRTC required Shaw Direct (then branded Star Choice) to offer the program until its next licence renewal at the end of August 2019.

In filing for that licence renewal, Shaw indicated it provided equipment and satellite service to more than 31,000 households, and while it refused to confirm for the CBC how many Canadians are currently receiving signals, it said it voluntarily kept the program going for two years longer than the CRTC originally requested.

In a statement emailed to CBC News, Shaw said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment on the LTSS while their application is in front of the CRTC.

Chunks of Canada lose access to basic, free TV

Large portions of Canada will no longer have access to basic services such as CBC Television signals if this goes through, according to Gregory Taylor, a University of Calgary assistant professor.

""You've got these dead zones as far as over-the-air television goes right now,"" said Taylor, an expert in Canada's conversion from analog to digital television.

He is not advocating that the CRTC require Shaw itself to continue the LTSS, but believes it's important the federal regulator maintain basic TV access across the country.

Small cities like Kingston, Ont., Brandon, Man., Fort McMurray, Alta., and Kelowna, B.C., would be affected.

Gregory Taylor, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, says the CRTC can 'be creative' to maintain the LTSS. (CBC)

""The success of this program should show the CRTC that this demand exists,"" said Taylor. ""The CRTC can be creative about this if they choose to make the effort to maintain it.""

Taylor pointed out the regulator has multiple sources of funding it can direct towards a program like the LTSS, similar to how the CRTC requires funding of Canadian television programming already.

Former chairman surprised by request

The past chairman of the CRTC from 2007-2012 told CBC News he was surprised to hear of Shaw requesting to kill the LTSS service.

""I don't understand why they would not [continue],"" said Konrad von Finkenstein, who oversaw the regulator during the analog to digital transition for broadcast signals, and pointed out the LTSS service gave Shaw free advertising and access to potential customer homes across the country.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-area-mom-foothills-school-division-cease-and-desist-letter-1.5122008,well there are 2 in this class room.  15 kids per teacher is a really low ratio,7.0,101.0,"A Calgary-area mother who spoke out to CBC News over concerns about a large combined Grade 2 class at Red Deer Lake School has been handed a cease-and-desist letter by a law firm on behalf of the school board.

The letter — served on behalf of the Foothills School Division — was written by Brownlee LLP, a large Edmonton law firm, and penned two days after CBC's original story was published.

""It's an example of trying to squash a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Gillian Colborne, one of the mothers who spoke to CBC News after pulling her son from the class over concerns he was struggling in a large room with 47 kids and two teachers.

Colborne, who has another child attending the school, says parents have been trying to get answers from the school division for months, and she was surprised to receive the three-page cease-and-desist letter.

Other parents have also received the letter and are not willing to be interviewed as a result.

""We are parents attempting to advocate for our children in a very calm open manner,"" said Colborne. ""It just seems unnecessary. I would have expected somebody to come to us and say, 'Oh, these are real and valid concerns you have. Let's sit down and talk about them.'""

Parents could be banned from school

The letter accuses parents of making false allegations in communications to various parties. It claims they've made defamatory comments, filed malicious complaints and says that they could be banned from the school. It also threatens legal action if they don't refrain from repeating or publishing their comments.

""Your advocacy has exceeded the boundaries of productive dialogue and devolved into disparaging the professional reputation of well-respected educators,"" the letter states.

It goes on to say the Foothills School Division has responded to each concern relating to their children. It accuses the parents of repeatedly pressuring school staff members through text messages, emails — as well as in person — and says several staff members claim they felt ""unduly pressured by your relentless tactics.""

""To be clear, you are to cease sending all e-mail or other correspondence that contains false or defamatory comments regarding any Foothills School Division employee to anyone. Any failure on your part to take heed of this warning may result in legal proceedings.""

The Foothills School division declined CBC's request for an interview. In a written statement, a spokesperson says: ""At times actions must be taken to ensure that third parties do not negatively impact a school environment and workplace.""

""We feel that we have fully addressed any questions surrounding the Grade 2 classroom configuration at Red Deer Lake School,"" the email states.

""We maintain that it is an effective learning environment. As we stated previously, all parents are welcome to continue to discuss with their child's teacher(s) and school administration any concerns they have about their child's learning.""

Barbara Silva with Support Our Students Alberta calls the cease-and-desist letters 'heavy-handed.' (CBC)

Letter called 'heavy-handed'

""It seems like a very heavy-handed way to shut this conversation down,"" said Barbara Silva, communications director with Support Our Students Alberta. ""Once you bring in legal counsel, it sets up a David and Goliath dynamic.""

Silva says she believes the parents' concerns about a large combined classroom are ""well-founded"" and exist around the province.

While her organization regularly hears from parents who feel their concerns aren't taken seriously by school divisions, Silva says she's never heard of a division taking this kind of legal step.

""Just the sheer image of a school board putting out cease-and-desist orders is pretty alarming,"" said Silva, who admits she isn't privy to all the communications that have occurred between the parents, the school and the school division.

""It puts parents in a position that either they're not going to come forward with their concerns, or they understand really clearly they're going to need to get legal counsel to do so. And that's going to make sure that a lot of people don't come forward with their concerns.""

&gt; For many Muslim women,  the hijab has become a symbol of Islamic feminism. Accordingly, Muslim women overwhelmingly find efforts (mostly of white non-Muslims) to “liberate” them to be deeply offensive and terribly misguided—in much the same way secular dictators in Iran and Turkey forced women to dress in “modern” (i.e. Western) styles, complete with fashion police to sanction women who dressed too conservatively or exclude them altogether from the public sphere.",-6.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

Current trends favor automated policing of what you can or cannot do online, since it costs money to actually bring people to a fair trial.",27.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

Star Editorial | Christchurch Call is a good step in fighting extremism

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-adds-record-jobs-april-1.5130682,Scheer is gonna implode,10.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

Stephen Garvey, leader of the Alliance, said the party was told the meetings had to be cancelled because the Legion doesn't allow political parties to book its halls.

The Alliance is calling for a drastic reduction in immigrants to Canada, rescinding the Multiculturalism Act and opposes hate speech laws and anti-Islamophobia policies. The party also believes climate change is a hoax.

Kicked out of N.S. parade last year

Last year, the group was kicked out of an Annapolis Valley parade, and a Legion booking in Halifax was cancelled.

Two years ago, CBC News reported Garvey took part in an anti-immigration protest outside a school in Red Deer, Alta which included members of the group Worldwide Coalition Against Islam.

Garvey said the Legion is being intimidated by his political foes into shutting the party out of its halls, which he called censorship.

He said the party is looking into holding events at other venues.

Valerie Mitchell-Veinotte, executive director of the Legion's Nova Scotia-Nunavut command in Dartmouth, said the bookings were made in error.

She said the branches had to cancel because the halls turned out to be unavailable on the dates requested.

There is no policy against renting to the Alliance, Mitchell-Veinotte said.

Branches could make other dates available, but Mitchell-Veinotte said if they do, the command would like to be consulted ""just to ensure that they are making facilities available to organizations that share the same goals and objectives and values as the Royal Canadian Legion.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

READ MORE: Atlantic Canada clean energy collaboration receives $2M federal investment

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository. If so, it seems like one more question may arise in the years ahead: does it really makes sense to build two?"

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is defending a decision to give a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservative Party a role in determining which news organizations are eligible for government funding.

Eight Canadian organizations will select representatives to sit on an advisory panel that will decide how the government should dole out $600-million media support fund, the government announced Wednesday.

They are News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

Unifor — a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservatives under both Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer — represents more than 12,000 journalists and media workers in Canada.

In a statement posted to Facebook, Unifor said critics are mischaracterizing its role on the panel. The union says it will help define the criteria through which the funds will be allocated, but won't be directly involved in deciding who gets the money.

""There is a lot at stake as we work to protect and preserve our news industry in Canada and after years of discussion we finally have a path forward,"" the union said.

As It Happens has reached out to Unifor for comment.

Rodriguez spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the new panel. Here is part of their conversation.

I don't know if you had a chance to read Chris Selley at the National Post ... who says that that your putting Unifor on this panel is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. How do you respond?

We chose different organizations that represent journalists and different media across the country with different regions being represented, both official languages, the ethnic press.

We wanted to make sure that it was representative of the industry, and that's the reason why they're all there.

Why Unifor?

It represents thousands of employees from the news sector.

But it also represents a very, very strong bias, doesn't it? Because Unifor has made it quite clear that they call themselves ""the resistance."" They have put out publicity. I'm sure you've seen their publicity: ""The resistance: Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" If you want to have a panel that appears to be unbiased, how does that help you?

This is Andrew Scheer's opinion, and ...

Excuse me. No, no. This is not Andrew Scheer's opinion. I'm looking at a picture put out. This is Unifor Canada's picture.

We're talking about professionals, which is the case of all the groups there are on this list.

And the reason why we wanted to intervene is because professional journalism is one of the pillars of democracy. And the Conservatives may think that, ""Well, you know what? We shouldn't do anything and then let them all die.""

On the contrary, we're saying, ""No, we have to be there to support them with one clear principle — to respect the freedom and independence of the press.""

Unifor posted this image in a November 2018 tweet that read: 'Unifor’s National Executive Board started planning for the federal election today @AndrewScheer #canlab #canpoli.' (@UniforTheUnion/Twitter)

That's not the issue here. The issue is that you said you were going to put together a panel, an advisory panel, to decide who is going to get the funds, the $600 million worth of support to the media in this country, and that you would have an unbiased and an independent panel.

Yes, which is the case.

Mr. Rodriguez, have you not seen the publicity that Unifor is putting out calling themselves ""the resistance"" and saying, ""Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" Have you not seen that?

I know what you're talking about.

The Conservatives are saying that Unifor, any people working or any journalists, can be bought by this program, which is not the case, and I think it's an insult to professional journalists that build their career on integrity and on independence and on professionalism.

We're talking about the people on the panel. We're not talking about the journalists who might be benefiting from these funds. We saw that Unifor, it was quite partisan during the 2015 election campaign, that they put out attack ads against Stephen Harper's Conservatives, which surely helped you get elected. So, again, we're back to this problem of an appearance of bias. That if you have, if you are giving this position to Unifor, to the union, to decide who is going to get this funding, when it's an organization that has clearly come out ... going against your political enemies, that's a problem, isn't it?

This is repeating what Andrew Scheer is saying. And, again, I have to disagree with you, because if you look at the role the associations are playing, the role ... the journalists are playing, they're there to ask the tough questions — just exactly like what you're doing.

And also, this proves my point that we need that type of journalism of tough questions. And maybe the Conservatives, they don't want to hear those questions, but I think they're absolutely necessary in our democracy. So that's why the panel is in place. That's why we're moving forward.

But you've asked this panel to help decide who is a proper journalist and what's a proper news outlet and who is worthy of these funds. And who you've put on the panel that gets to decide that an organization that has a very, very strong, very partisan political statement.

But you keep repeating the same thing.

Because I'm not getting a very good answer from you.

I am answering your question and I'm saying that it's a panel with different people there from different sides of the industry, all representing professional journalists.

I guess what I'm trying to get to ... is that you want people to trust this fund, and Canadians want journalism they can trust. They want to believe that it's unbiased. But if the critics of your fund have always raised the alarm about any possible bias, that's why you wanted to have an independent panel. But haven't you just walked into that trap?

No, these panels represent people from all sides of industry. It represents work as a journalist, it represents the owners, it represents francophones, anglophones, the different regions, the ethnic media. It represents everybody.

And you don't think that there is a bias here, or a perception of bias, if you have as one of your panel members — and I know I'm asking you this once again, and I apologize for that, but I still haven't got a clear answer — do you not think that this is a problem of bias?

But I did answer your question.

You don't think that there's any bias on the part of Unifor, that Unifor doesn't have a political agenda?

No, you're saying that the journalists they represent have their own agenda.

No, no, I'm not saying that.

Yes, you're saying that.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm not. The panel you put together has Unifor as one of its members. And the question is that an organization that is clearly partisan and anti-Conservative, and have made that very clear, we're asking if that's an appropriate party to have on this panel?

We're saying that we need people from all walks of life. In this case ... people that represent the workers, the employers, the regions, the official languages and all of that to be represented there to make sure that this panel represents all of them, and that it takes neutral decisions on professional journalism.

Police are still looking for the driver, who abandoned his vehicle and fled the crash scene.

The hit and run happened at about 7:20 a.m. on the westbound lanes of Laurier Avenue W., not far from where traffic from the Queen Elizabeth Driveway merges onto Laurier.

The cyclist, believed to be between 55 and 60 years old, suffered multi-system trauma and severe head injuries after he was thrown off his bicycle, according to Marc-Antoine Deschamps, an Ottawa paramedic spokesperson.

Speaking Thursday morning, Marc-Antoine Deschamps with Ottawa paramedics said a male cyclist sustained life-threatening injuries when he was struck by a vehicle. The cyclist later died in hospital. 0:27

""He sustained some very significant head injuries,"" Deschamps said. ""Paramedics tried to stabilize on scene and on the way to the trauma centre with life-threatening injuries.""

Early Thursday afternoon, police announced the cyclist had died in hospital, and that his identity is not being released.

The right front side of the minivan, including the windshield and bumper, suffered extensive damage.

An arrest has not yet been made.

The suspect is described as a skinny man with long black hair standing five feet 10 inches tall, according to police.

He was seen on a surveillance camera at the Rideau Centre, not far from where the van was abandoned, wearing a light-coloured jacket over a hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans and white sneakers with two stripes on the side.

He was also carrying a blue backpack.

Police are asking anyone who might have witnessed the crash or taken photos or video to get in touch with the collision investigation unit at 613-236-1222, ext. 2481.

Several police officers could be seen scouring the area near the Rideau Centre and Westin Hotel in the hours following the collision.

Police have closed westbound Laurier Avenue W. between Elgin and Nicholas streets and northbound Elgin Street from Laurier to Slater streets.

The eastbound lanes of the Mackenzie King Bridge were also closed but they reopened shortly before 1:30 p.m.

The stretch of Laurier where the cyclist was struck has a painted bike lane and is not segregated from vehicles.

Decriminalization led by a slim 51 per cent, according to preliminary figures on Tuesday's election released by Denver's Election Division. As many as 1,300 votes still remain to be counted, but that figure was not enough to swing the vote the other way, division spokesperson Alton Dillard said.

Final election results will be released on May 16, he said.

Organizers turned to the same strategy that marijuana activists used to decriminalize pot possession in the city in 2005. That move was followed by statewide legalization in 2012. A number of other states have since broadly allowed marijuana sales and use by adults.

Organizers say their only goal in the mushroom measure is to keep people out of jail in Denver for using or possessing the drug to cope with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and other conditions.

The initiative effectively decriminalizes use or possession of psilocybin by people 21 and older, making it the lowest enforcement priority for police and prosecutors. It does not legalize psilocybin or permit its sale by cannabis businesses.

Kevin Matthews, director of the Decriminalize Denver campaign, said psilocybin has helped him deal with depression for years.

""This is not something you have to take every day,"" the 33-year-old Denver native said. ""It provides a lot of lasting benefits, weeks and months after one experience.""

Used in religious practices

Psilocybin has been federally outlawed since the 1960s, when it was widely known as a recreational drug. The ban stymied medical research, but small studies in recent years have found the substance had positive effects on anxiety and depression for cancer patients.

Users have described seeing vivid colours and geometric patterns and experiencing powerful spiritual connections and emotions.

Magic mushrooms have been used in religious practices for decades because of their powerful effect on perceptions and spiritual experiences. Those same effects have appealed to recreational users dating to the 1960s counterculture movement.

A California effort to decriminalize psilocybin failed to qualify for the statewide ballot in 2018. Organizers in Oregon are trying to gather enough support to put an initiative to a statewide vote next year.

Mayor opposed initiative

It took the pro-psilocybin organizers in Denver three tries to develop language approved by city officials for the ballot. They collected more than 8,000 signatures to qualify for Tuesday's election.

Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and District Attorney Beth McCann opposed the initiative, but there was no organized campaign against decriminalization. The city's election largely focused on a six-way race for mayor and a heated effort to end Denver's ""urban camping"" ban that affects people without housing.

Voters roundly rejected an end to the camping ban. In the mayor's race, incumbent Michael Hancock will face a June 4 runoff election against challenger Jamie Giellis.

The mushroom ordinance also prevents city funds from being used to pursue criminal penalties on possession or use and creates a panel to study the effects of the change."

Absolutely 0% chance of the NDP or the Conservatives dropping this story during the campaign. They will make sure it's in the news.",1.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-area-mom-foothills-school-division-cease-and-desist-letter-1.5122008,I had 30 in mine 22 years ago and fuck me how was 2nd grade that long ago. That math made my heart hurt a bit,4.0,101.0,"A Calgary-area mother who spoke out to CBC News over concerns about a large combined Grade 2 class at Red Deer Lake School has been handed a cease-and-desist letter by a law firm on behalf of the school board.

The letter — served on behalf of the Foothills School Division — was written by Brownlee LLP, a large Edmonton law firm, and penned two days after CBC's original story was published.

""It's an example of trying to squash a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Gillian Colborne, one of the mothers who spoke to CBC News after pulling her son from the class over concerns he was struggling in a large room with 47 kids and two teachers.

Colborne, who has another child attending the school, says parents have been trying to get answers from the school division for months, and she was surprised to receive the three-page cease-and-desist letter.

Other parents have also received the letter and are not willing to be interviewed as a result.

""We are parents attempting to advocate for our children in a very calm open manner,"" said Colborne. ""It just seems unnecessary. I would have expected somebody to come to us and say, 'Oh, these are real and valid concerns you have. Let's sit down and talk about them.'""

Parents could be banned from school

The letter accuses parents of making false allegations in communications to various parties. It claims they've made defamatory comments, filed malicious complaints and says that they could be banned from the school. It also threatens legal action if they don't refrain from repeating or publishing their comments.

""Your advocacy has exceeded the boundaries of productive dialogue and devolved into disparaging the professional reputation of well-respected educators,"" the letter states.

It goes on to say the Foothills School Division has responded to each concern relating to their children. It accuses the parents of repeatedly pressuring school staff members through text messages, emails — as well as in person — and says several staff members claim they felt ""unduly pressured by your relentless tactics.""

""To be clear, you are to cease sending all e-mail or other correspondence that contains false or defamatory comments regarding any Foothills School Division employee to anyone. Any failure on your part to take heed of this warning may result in legal proceedings.""

The Foothills School division declined CBC's request for an interview. In a written statement, a spokesperson says: ""At times actions must be taken to ensure that third parties do not negatively impact a school environment and workplace.""

""We feel that we have fully addressed any questions surrounding the Grade 2 classroom configuration at Red Deer Lake School,"" the email states.

""We maintain that it is an effective learning environment. As we stated previously, all parents are welcome to continue to discuss with their child's teacher(s) and school administration any concerns they have about their child's learning.""

Barbara Silva with Support Our Students Alberta calls the cease-and-desist letters 'heavy-handed.' (CBC)

Letter called 'heavy-handed'

""It seems like a very heavy-handed way to shut this conversation down,"" said Barbara Silva, communications director with Support Our Students Alberta. ""Once you bring in legal counsel, it sets up a David and Goliath dynamic.""

Silva says she believes the parents' concerns about a large combined classroom are ""well-founded"" and exist around the province.

While her organization regularly hears from parents who feel their concerns aren't taken seriously by school divisions, Silva says she's never heard of a division taking this kind of legal step.

""Just the sheer image of a school board putting out cease-and-desist orders is pretty alarming,"" said Silva, who admits she isn't privy to all the communications that have occurred between the parents, the school and the school division.

""It puts parents in a position that either they're not going to come forward with their concerns, or they understand really clearly they're going to need to get legal counsel to do so. And that's going to make sure that a lot of people don't come forward with their concerns.""

Michael Chertoff has a warning for Canada about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Canada's federal government is currently deciding whether Huawei can be trusted to build the next generation of Internet infrastructure across the country.

Chertoff, who was the United States' homeland security secretary under former president George W. Bush, says that decision could have major consequences for Canada's relationships with both China and the United States.

Meanwhile, Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is due to appear in a Vancouver court where a judge will consider an extradition request from the United States.

Here is part of Chertoff's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.

Mr. Chertoff, how is the United States likely to respond if Justin Trudeau agrees to allow Huawei 5G network to be a principal part of our system?

I think it's going to raise concerns about the security of your system.

We've seen stories recently, in fact, involving more back doors or problems with Chinese software and hardware.

So that's going to create some obstacles to the ability to rapidly share data because they're concerned that there'll be a compromise.

Chertoff cautions Canadians to reconsider pursuing a 5G network deal with Chinese tech giant Huawei. (Reuters)

You know that China says that Huawei is a private company — that the Chinese government is not involved with it and that there are firewalls that would protect these networks from any kind of Chinese influence. What does the United States think of that?

I think most Americans are skeptical of that for a number of reasons.

First of all, the Chinese clearly anoint certain companies as champions and support them.

And if you just look at what happened recently, with respect to Canadians being arrested in China as retaliation for the arrest of a senior Huawei official, it suggests a degree of solicitude for the company by the Chinese government that is is not consistent with the idea that they're independent.

To could give the Chinese the ability to occupy a pivotal part of your infrastructure, one that will be, as I say, the commanding heights of the next 10 or 20 years of the economy, you're giving them enormous leverage in any dispute.

You're giving them a surface area for which they can potentially take intellectual property or otherwise compromise confidential material and you have to, I think, seriously view China as a rival, if not an adversary.

The U.S. is seeking the extradition of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, but Canada appears to be bearing the brunt of China's displeasure in a situation that blurs the lines between politics and justice. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

What could they potentially do?

Well, they could either find or embed pathways in to compromise networks and allow the theft of intellectual property.

They could introduce disruption or latency into the network because it's not just the hardware and software that you first install. It's all of the updates, the patches, everything you do to them to tend to and monitor the system going forward.

It's not just a question of taking data and either misusing it or stealing intellectual property. This will actually be part of the mechanism that controls your industrial control systems and your operating systems.

So the person who dominates that, in a way, has the ability to affect everything from your power grid to your air traffic control system to your even your sensitive national security infrastructure.

The Canadian government is deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention of two Canadians in China. Read my statement: <a href=""https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc"">https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc</a> —@cafreeland

As you mentioned, we have two Canadians who are detained in China, held in isolation. Two others on death row. In other matters, our trade is being deeply effected as the Chinese shut us out of the markets. All this because of this extradition request from your country for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meanwhile, your president is busy securing a comprehensive free trade agreement with China and moving ahead and benefiting. So do you understand why Canadians might feel like we're being played here?

Well, I don't think that's a fair inference. Look, I think there are a couple of different things.

First of all, I mean obviously the security relationship the U.S. and Canada have is a very strong one. We're allies and I don't think anybody believes the U.S. is an ally of China — nor is it clear to me what's going to come out of this trade agreement.

I think what actually is demonstrated by Chinese behaviour is that when you're touching on what they view as one of their national champions, they will use any leverage they have to punish you.

And that ought to cause people to ask the question: well geez, if we give them the keys to the kingdom on our 5G network, what will they do if they don't like something we do in the future?

But wait a second. We arrested Meng Wanzhou at your behest, at your government's behest, and we're being punished while you move ahead with getting the trade deals that we're shut out of now. So I guess the question is, you know, at some point this seems rather unfair to us.

First of all, I don't know whether the Chinese aren't going to try to punish the U.S.

But if you're asking me why the Chinese decided they were going to focus on Canada in retaliating, I think it suggests they're trying to bully Canada and it may be that they feel they can get away with it more with Canada or that they can intervene before the extradition gets done.

Well, maybe the United States should start pushing back at our behest a bit.

I think we may see some further developments. I would not describe your relationship between China and the U.S. as a warm and fuzzy relationship.

There are a lot of different deals going on but I would be very careful not to have the Chinese try to drive a wedge between the Canadians and the Americans, by making it seem as if they're picking on one and not on the other.

Well, President Trump has said that he may trade Meng Wanzhou for getting his trade deals. So, maybe we're being played by your country as well.

I don't know what you're referring to and I don't read Twitter as a map for what's going to happen.

I would not presume anybody knows what's going to be the next step in all this because there are a lot of balls in the air.

Is it not true that President Trump suggested that he could exchange Meng Wanzhou for a trade deal with China?

He often says all kinds of different things, which never come to pass. So I'm not going to speculate as to what was in his head. But I'm not going to presume that this has any realistic prospect of happening.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/philpott-wilson-raybould-political-future-1.5150957/,Why can't someone be successful as an independent?,12.0,197.0,"Former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott will seek re-election as Independent candidates in the fall election campaign, having rejected an offer to join the Green Party after weeks of talks with leader Elizabeth May.

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

It has been one of the greatest honours of my life serving as the Member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville. Today I announced I will be seeking re-election as an Independent candidate in the 2019 federal election.

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/canoe-lake-cree-nation-vote-buying-scheme-1.5133756,...Why?,2.0,167.0,"Larry Iron blew the whistle on himself.

Then, months after providing an intricate account of his own voter fraud, he tried to make the whole thing go away.

So far, he's been mostly successful.

In January 2017, an Indigenous politician swore on the record that he traded money for votes during the recent election of chief and council on the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation. Then he tried to take it all back. The CBC iTeam Geoff Leo investigates the allegation. 11:30

In January 2017, the Indigenous politician swore on the record that he traded money for votes during the recent election of chief and council on the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation, which is about 350 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon. He offered bank records to prove it.

I do verily believe that they misappropriated funds from Canoe Lake Cree First Nation. They used these misappropriated funds to purchase votes and influence electors. - Larry Iron's affidavit

Larry's affidavit, combined with almost three full bankers boxes of documents filed in federal court, paint a picture of an elaborate and extensive vote-buying scheme.

It's all included in an application filed by activists from the First Nation, attempting to overturn the results of the Dec. 16, 2016 election.

They alleged that some candidates, ""provided money, employment, contracts, cigarettes, gasoline and other valuable consideration to electors and persons that have influence on electors in exchange for the vote of electors.""

Larry was one of those activists. Larry was also one of those candidates. And his allegations were the backbone of the case.

A detailed affidavit

Larry swore an affidavit just weeks after the election saying it had been influenced by a vote-buying scheme orchestrated by the chief and a couple of councillors.

""I do verily believe that they misappropriated funds from Canoe Lake Cree First Nation,"" Larry wrote. ""They used these misappropriated funds to purchase votes and influence electors.""

Larry's 34-page affidavit says he knew about the plan because he was an active participant. It provides a detailed description of how he and several others used public money to pay band members to vote for a slate of candidates — a slate that included Larry.

The affidavit lays out who Larry paid, how much and on which dates. He provided bank records to back up some of his claims.

None of the claims in the affidavit have been tested in court.

Larry seen as 'incriminating himself'

Leonard Iron, no relation, was one of the activists who joined with Larry in the attempt to overturn the election.

Leonard says he was stunned by the detailed evidence Larry provided and by Larry's willingness to risk being prosecuted.

According to an affidavit filed by Leonard, Larry told the activists he had been warned by his lawyer, ""that what he, Larry Iron, had disclosed contained criminal conduct above and beyond that of vote buying, that he was implicated, that a criminal investigation was a likely event, and that he would be subject to the same legal consequences as others he was accusing if those matters were proven in court.""

Under the First Nations Elections Act, the activists' only option was to take the matter to court.

Larry's decision to proceed gave Leonard and the other activists great confidence.

""We convinced ourselves that if Larry Iron was willing to swear an affidavit in which he would be incriminating himself he could not possibly back out after that,"" said Leonard.

Leonard and the other activists turned out to be wrong about that.

Larry bails out

Six months later, Larry bailed on the case, requesting his affidavit be withdrawn. In a letter on the court file, Larry said he had reached an agreement with the Chief to enact sweeping reforms on reserve.

In his affidavit, Leonard said Larry showed up at a band meeting at the end of June 2017 to announce he was withdrawing the appeal of the election. Until that point, Larry had been funding the effort.

In addition, Leonard wrote that Larry, ""apparently speaking on behalf of the respondents (the chief and some councillors), began offering me employment with the First Nation if I agreed to drop the appeal.""

""Larry Iron advised me that 'You might as well accept. You won't get anywhere without my affidavit anyway.' ""

Leonard refused.

""We wanted this case to continue, especially after we obtained all those documents,"" Leonard said. ""It's insane what they were doing.""

For me the case is closed and it's an old story. - Larry Iron

The case collapsed. Leonard said neither the RCMP nor the federal government would do anything to help.

In a letter to Leonard, the RCMP said the ""affidavit serves only as an unsubstantiated allegation,"" and said the banking records weren't useful because, ""documents compelled during a civil proceeding such as this, cannot be used in a criminal proceeding against an individual.""

As for the federal government, Leonard said they've been no help either, opting to refer Leonard to the courts or back to the chief and council. He said he's baffled that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is so eager to support democracy around the globe but not here in Canada.

""Why is this guy concerned about fair and even elections in Venezuela when he doesn't care about the same thing on reserves?"" Leonard asked. ""He's responsible for them and he doesn't do a damn thing about it.""

Earlier this month, CBC asked Larry for an interview about his affidavit and Leonard's allegations. He refused.

""For me the case is closed and it's an old story,"" Larry told CBC before hanging up.

Todd MacKay with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation said that he's heard allegations of voter fraud on First Nations in Saskatchewan for years, but that he's never seen a case with this much sworn evidence. He said his organization is working with the activists to help draw attention to the case.

Allegations of voter fraud in federal or provincial elections have resulted in aggressive investigations, but the Canoe Lake case has resulted in ""one huge collective shrug,"" McKay said.

He said that, given the seriousness of the allegations on Canoe Lake, ""the people there deserve answers and frankly all Canadians deserve answers because this shouldn't be happening anywhere in the world. And it absolutely can't be happening in Canada.""

Larry 'felt betrayed'

In his affidavit, Larry said he had worked with the Chief Francis Iron during the course of the December 2016 election campaign to pay voters to cast ballots for a slate of candidates that included Larry himself, who was running for council.

Elected office on Canoe Lake can be very profitable.

Chief Francis Iron, first elected in 2014, was paid $221,000 in salary and expenses in 2015/2016 to run a reserve of slightly more than 1,000 people, according to the federal government. Councillors were paid as much as $182,000 that same year.

Chief Francis was re-elected, but Larry lost.

According to the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation's Facebook page, Chief Francis Iron was sworn in on March 16, 2017. (Canoe Lake Cree First Nation/Facebook)

Larry was furious, according to Leonard.

""He was supposed to be elected because he was part of that conspiracy and then he felt betrayed by those people because he wasn't elected,"" Leonard told CBC.

Leonard's affidavit adds, ""his conscience was bothering him about the extent of vote-buying that had occurred, in which he was personally involved and that if he did not come forward, the corrupt activities he had witnessed would escalate.""

An affidavit filed in federal court by band member Margaret Couillonneur said ""[Larry] stated to me that he was 'going to get everybody' and that he was going to appeal the results of the election.""

Leonard wrote in his affidavit that, days after the election, Larry invited him and several other band members to a restaurant where he ""disclosed shocking information about his involvement in a vote buying conspiracy with enough details that it provided credibility to his claim that 'No one else had a chance of winning the election except the ones who ultimately won.""

Leonard and the other activists agreed to work with Larry to overturn the election.

Duelling explanations for payments to band members

In many cases, Chief Francis and another accused councillor Wilfred Iron, in their respective affidavits, seem to agree with Larry on the basic facts.

Chief Francis and Wilfred concede that in the days and weeks leading up to the December 16, 2016 vote they provided Larry with money to give to other band members.

The primary dispute centres on what the payments were for.

While Larry claims they were given in exchange for votes, Chief Francis and Wilfred deny that and offer a range of other explanations.

Unfortunately, it has been a common practice in elections of Canoe Lake Cree First Nation that candidates offer money or similar such matters in exchange for votes. - Larry Iron's affidavit

Marie Florence Yew, a Canoe Lake band councillor until the December election, filed an affidavit saying many payments described by Larry were not lawfully authorized.

Yew said that according to the Indian Act, any payments from band accounts must be authorized by band council.

""At no point in time were any of these directives referred to in the affidavit of Larry Amable Iron sworn January 7, 2017, discussed at a band council meeting,"" she wrote.

Under questioning by lawyers for the activists, Chief Francis conceded that some payments are made without a band council meeting.

""When emergencies come up, there's no time to call a meeting. You know that. Emergency comes up, family member's in hospital, what are we supposed to do? Oh,wait, I got to call a meeting. Can't say that,"" said Chief Francis.

He said in other cases, the payments were authorized by an impromptu phone meeting of a quorum of council.

However, he said in most cases payments from band accounts are authorized at a council meeting.

Timeline of alleged vote-buying

Late October 2016

The court application to overturn the election describes an October 2016 meeting between Chief Francis and Larry, when they discussed ""the prospect of working together to influence the election.""

Larry's affidavit says he asked Chief Francis whether there was sufficient funding and the chief told him not to be concerned about money, ""as he had everything set up and that he had 'access.' Francis Xavier Iron then indicated that 'Whatever it takes, I need to get back into power.' ""

Larry's affidavit says adequate funding is crucial to elections on the First Nation.

""Unfortunately, it has been a common practice in elections of Canoe Lake Cree First Nation that candidates offer money or similar such matters in exchange for votes, or that electors demand the same in exchange for their votes.""

The affidavit claims that Chief Francis offered Larry and two influential female band members, Margaret Coulineur and Malvina Iron, a series of payments between $1,000 and $2,500 in exchange for their assistance and support.

""Francis Xavier Iron then indicated that if he was elected, there would be a further $5,000 in cash paid to each of us, and if he was 'very successful' that a 'bonus' would also be paid.""

November 3, 2016

In his affidavit, Chief Francis confirms that on November 3, 2016, he met with Larry, Margaret and Malvina, ""to formally ask them for their support in the upcoming … election.""

He also confirmed he provided each of them with cheques for $1,500, but said ""no discussion occurred with respect to providing any of them with money to secure their support.""

In early November 2016, Larry Iron was provided a cheque from Chief Francis Iron. Larry says the money was paid in exchange for his support and assistance during the election. (Federal court)

The chief said he gave Larry the money as an act of charity.

""I often agree to assist band members with money and I agreed to assist Larry Amable Iron with assistance in the amount of $1,500.""

He said he gave Margaret and Malvina the money because they agreed to attend a meeting of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) on his behalf.

In their affidavits, both women agreed they were paid on November 3 and intended to go to the FSIN event. But they both said they were unable to attend.

However, under cross-examination, the lawyer for the activists pointed out that the FSIN event they agreed to attend happened on October 26 and 27.

Neither woman explained why they accepted payment to attend an event they didn't attend.

In the midst of that questioning, Margaret said wasn't feeling well and may need a break from the cross-examination.

""In case I have to, I got to. I can't sit here, and then I'm going to fall over. Then what?""

Both Margaret and Malvina claimed they did volunteer work in exchange for the money rather than repaying the band and they denied making any agreement to support Chief Francis or help him with the election.

November 30, 2016

According to Larry's affidavit, he and Chief Francis delivered a $1,000 cheque to a band member. The cheque had a notation that read, ""off reserve assistance.""

Chief Francis told the man ""if he voted for him that he would continue to support [him] in this way,'"" Larry alleged.

In his affidavit, Chief Francis confirmed the payment happened but said it was band assistance money to help the man pay for materials to fix his cabin.

December 2, 2016

Larry said in his affidavit that on December 2, Chief Francis informed him that $700 had been deposited into Larry's bank account. He said the Chief told him the money, ""was to set up a meeting for off-reserve members and to plan a supper"" hosted by the chief.

Larry's affidavit says Chief Francis Iron told him he was being provided $700 to organize a campaign supper for the chief. (Federal court)

December 5, 2016

Wilfred Iron, a councillor running for re-election, confirms in his own affidavit there was a dinner on December 5 and cheques were handed out.

He wrote that he paid three band members, who he named, $400 each. Documentation he attached shows the word ""donation"" beside each payment.

Wilfred's affidavit says at that meeting he ""received a large number of requests from urban band members seeking assistance from the band with money to pay bills, rent and or purchase groceries.""

He said these sorts of requests ""are a normal occurrence around the holiday season.""

""I specifically deny that any payments or assistance was provided to any band member for the purpose of securing their vote or to unlawfully influence their vote,"" Wilfred wrote.

December 6, 2016

Larry was sent by the chief to the First Nations Bank in Saskatoon, where Canoe Lake had its accounts, to pick up some cash and cheques for people as dictated by a directive prepared by the chief.

Larry says Chief Francis provided him a written list of cheques and cash he was instructed to pick up from the bank. (Federal court)

He wrote that he was surprised to see that Chief Francis was authorizing $4,000 cheques for certain council candidates given that the chief ""had previously told me that those persons were not campaigning with us.""

According to Larry's affidavit, the chief replied ""he had to ensure they all got $4,000 because they all knew about the financial transactions that had occurred… and that if any of them were not successful in the election that $4,000 would ensure their silence 'so they couldn't come after me if they lost in the election.' ""

In his affidavit, Chief Francis confirmed that he asked Larry to pick up and deliver the money but denied it was to buy votes. Instead, the chief said, the payments were for travel and honorariums.

In addition to cheques for council candidates, Larry was also instructed to pick up cheques for band members and deposit them into their accounts.

One of those people, Barry Opekokew, confirmed in an affidavit that a $1,000 cheque had been deposited into his account by Larry.

He said the money wasn't to buy his vote but instead was ""for financial assistance to attend Saskatoon for my father-in-law's medical treatment."" .

Larry said the chief also told him to pick up $6,000 cash from the bank ""to ensure that they had enough money to influence voters and in particular during the elders gathering.""

The band had arranged an elders gathering to be held in a Prince Albert hotel on December 6 to 8. The advanced poll was being held in the same hotel in the midst of that elders gathering.

Canoe Lake paid for the elders hotel and paid each of them $500 cash.

In an interview with CBC, Chief Francis said that money was to help pay for some extra elders who weren't pre-registered for the event.

""I understand it would make it look shady but it had nothing to do with giving money for the election they were just forgotten payments,"" said the chief.

During cross-examination Canoe Lake's interim manager, Rachel Iron, conceded that the December 2016 payments weren't entered into the band's general ledger until February 2017 — after the election appeal had been launched.

December 8, 2016

Larry said Chief Francis and Wilfred told him they were depositing another $750 in his bank account, ""which they told me was to be used by me to pay band members in exchange for their vote.""

In his affidavit, Wilfred said that money wasn't to buy votes but was to cover Larry's expenses travelling back and forth to the bank.

Larry said the chief also gave him an additional $900 cash and instructed him to provide it to three men in Meadow Lake with instructions to vote for a slate of candidates that included the chief and Larry. The chief denies this.

Larry said he spent most of this day at a hotel in Saskatoon where he witnessed a steady stream of band members meeting with Chief Francis and Wilfred. Larry said the chief ""informed me these band members were collecting cash payments for their votes.""

He said that on one occasion, Chief Francis and Wilfred were away so Larry paid two band members $100 dollars each, on direction from the chief.

Chief Francis said he wasn't at that hotel on that date ""nor did I hand out money to band members to secure their votes.""

December 9, 2016

Larry said the chief provided him $300 cash to pass on to a couple of named band members. The chief denies this.

In addition, Larry said the chief sent him an email transfer of $200 to provide to a female band member.

The chief confirms making that $200 payment but he denied the money was election related.

Instead he said it was an assistance payment made to Larry directly because of his ""inability to pay his basic bills.""

December 13, 2016

Larry's affidavit says the chief wanted to send another $2,500 to Larry ""for payments to various voters prior to the main poll on December 16.""

Larry said this time he expressed some reservation.

""I was concerned with the number of transfers that I was receiving and my inability to explain them. I refused to accept any further direct transfers,"" the affidavit says.

According to Larry's affidavit, Chief Francis suggested transferring money to Larry's son Keith Iron instead. Larry said the chief indicated that in the bands books, he would make it appear ""as payment in relation to work that Keith Iron had done.""

Keith's account received a transfer of $2,500.

In an affidavit, Keith confirms he received the money and passed most of it on to his father.

Larry's affidavit says this bank statement shows that Chief Francis Iron had $2,500 transferred to Larry's son Keith, which Keith then immediately transferred to Larry. (Federal court)

""My father confided in me that he had grown uncomfortable with so much money being transferred into his personal bank account from the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation without any documentation as to why such deposits were occurring,"" Keith said in his affidavit.

In his affidavit, Chief Francis said the payment was for work Keith had done on the Canoe Lake store.

However, Keith's affidavit says ""I did not perform any work or provide any other services nor had I agreed to perform work or provide services for the First Nation for which I should be paid.""

December 14 & 15, 2016

Larry said he went to the home of a band member where he delivered $100 cheques to five people, all of whom are named in the affidavit. Larry directed them to vote for a slate of candidates that included Chief Francis and himself.

Larry said he went back to that same home, delivering another eight $100 cheques and directing the band members who received them to vote for a slate of candidates that included Chief Francis and himself.

The chief's affidavit says ""this money was not provided for these alleged purposes.""

Several of the people alleged by Larry to have been paid in exchange for their vote filed affidavits denying having received any such payment.

December 16, 2016 - Election Day

Larry said the chief told him to pick up a female band member, give her $200 and ask her to pick up three men, who are named in the affidavit, from a neighbouring First Nation and bring them to a polling station.

The woman was to tell the men if they voted for the chief's slate of candidates he would give them $200 each.

Larry also claims the chief told the woman to fill up her tank at the band store and charge it to the First Nation's account.

Larry backs out, killing court case

In June 2017, many of the people who filed affidavits supporting or opposing the motion to overturn the election were cross-examined by lawyers.

Leonard says he was there for all of it and was very pleased with how it was going.

However, on the final day, Larry approached Leonard to say he was bailing out.

Leonard's affidavit says that's when Larry offered to get him a job if he also agreed to drop the case. Leonard refused.

On July 7, 2017, Larry wrote the lawyer representing him, requesting that his affidavit and those of his sons be withdrawn. ""We are requesting that the parties involved can no longer use our affidavits in this case.""

When reached by CBC earlier this month, Larry seemed to be under the impression that by sending that letter, the affidavit was no longer public.

""They were all taken out from the court system,"" Larry told CBC when reached by phone. ""There's no affidavits in there."" CBC pointed out that his affidavit is still on the public record in federal court.

Shortly after pulling out of the court case, Larry began campaigning for vice-chief at the Meadow Lake Tribal Council, the second-in-command for the organization, which represents nine northwest Saskatchewan First Nations.

Larry won the job in November 2017 after having received more support from the 49 appointed delegates than his closest competitor.

'A one time opportunity to deal with this issue'

In a July 2017 letter to the law society about the matter, Larry said he ended the court case because he had reached an agreement with the leadership of the First Nation to enact sweeping reforms.

""The community has been faced with this kind of behaviour for the last 20 years,"" he wrote. ""We now have a one time opportunity to deal with this issue head on with the community members and guaranteed this will never happen again in our election process.""

He claimed that in exchange for withdrawing his affidavit, ""Chief Francis along with his council have agreed to inact (sp) a advisory council and have allowed my team and complainants to be part of the process.""

He also claimed they agreed to develop and implement a new financial management act, an executive act and a financial audit committee.

When reached by phone earlier this month, Chief Francis denied any such agreement.

""There was no deal made between the band and Larry,"" said the chief. ""I'll leave it at that.""

When asked if he had made any of the reforms Larry claimed were coming, the chief provided a simple answer.

""No."""

The National Citizens Alliance says it had scheduled town hall meetings next month at Legions in Halifax, Truro and Sydney.

But the Legion cancelled the bookings on Monday, around the same time as a social media campaign started to criticize the bookings.

Stephen Garvey, leader of the Alliance, said the party was told the meetings had to be cancelled because the Legion doesn't allow political parties to book its halls.

""Political rights are at the heart of our fundamental freedoms, yet they're being sacrificed now, because someone doesn't like a viewpoint or something,"" Garvey said.

""There's no laws broken.""

The National Citizens Alliance, which is based in Calgary, became a registered federal party in January, according to Elections Canada.

The Alliance is calling for a drastic reduction in immigrants to Canada, rescinding the Multiculturalism Act and opposes hate speech laws and anti-Islamophobia policies. The party also believes climate change is a hoax.

Kicked out of N.S. parade last year

Last year, the group was kicked out of an Annapolis Valley parade, and a Legion booking in Halifax was cancelled.

Two years ago, CBC News reported Garvey took part in an anti-immigration protest outside a school in Red Deer, Alta which included members of the group Worldwide Coalition Against Islam.

Garvey, then-leader of the National Advancement Party of Canada, a federally registered political party, said the intent of the protest was to raise awareness about the need to protect ""Canadian culture"" in schools.""

Garvey said the Legion is being intimidated by his political foes into shutting the party out of its halls, which he called censorship.

He said the party is looking into holding events at other venues.

Valerie Mitchell-Veinotte, executive director of the Legion's Nova Scotia-Nunavut command in Dartmouth, said the bookings were made in error.

No policy against NCA: Legion

She said the branches had to cancel because the halls turned out to be unavailable on the dates requested.

There is no policy against renting to the Alliance, Mitchell-Veinotte said.

Branches could make other dates available, but Mitchell-Veinotte said if they do, the command would like to be consulted ""just to ensure that they are making facilities available to organizations that share the same goals and objectives and values as the Royal Canadian Legion.""

Provincial officials have told the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine (OIRM) that its $5 million in annual funding from the province will cease next March.

The Toronto-based institute provides grants to help Ontario researchers turn their their stem cell discoveries into treatments that are both medically and commercially viable.

The government's decision to terminate the funding is ""extremely short-sighted and uninformed,"" said Bernard Thébaud, a neonatal researcher who received funding from OIRM to explore the use of stem cells in preventing complications from premature birth.

""If [the government] would do a careful analysis, they would realize this is a worthwhile investment,"" said Thébaud, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and professor of pediatrics at the University of Ottawa.

Bernard Thébaud, a neonatologist at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and a senior scientist with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, says if the government would do a 'careful analysis' it would realize stem-cell research is a 'worthwhile investment.' (Canadian Lung Association)

His work has shown that stem cells isolated from the umbilical cord have the potential to prevent brain and lung damage in premature babies and promote healthy development of the organs as the children age.

""We believe this [research] could be a game-changer for these pre-term babies and could substantially improve their outcomes,"" Thébaud said Wednesday in an interview.

The funding to OIRM came from Ontario's Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. The minister responsible, Todd Smith, said the researchers can turn to the private sector.

""The previous government was throwing millions of dollars around like crazy and they were not holding anyone accountable as to how they were spending that money,"" Smith told reporters Wednesday at Queen's Park.

""What we've heard from the life-sciences sector is that a lot of these organizations don't actually need government money, that the private sector will step up,"" said Smith.

But scientists in the stem-cell field say the private sector is not willing to invest until their studies reach a late phase. To get there, they say government funding is crucial.

""We pick the really outstanding projects that have true potential and we fund them to the point where they can attract additional funding and then begin to move forward,"" said Duncan Stewart, president and scientific director of OIRM.

""Without a catalyst to kick-start the process, then it's not going to happen.""

The scientists see a bitter irony in the government's move, since stem cell research was born in Ontario. James Till and Ernest McCulloch discovered the existence of stem cells in 1961 at the Toronto-based Ontario Cancer Institute.

""It's very deflating, it's very disappointing to learn that this is going to not continue,"" said Stewart.

""The concern is that many great ideas, great technologies that could have blossomed into successful new opportunities commercially and new therapies for our patients just aren't going to move forward.""

Research funded by OIRM attracted a $225-million investment by pharmaceutical giant Bayer and venture capital firm Versant Ventures to create BlueRock Therapeutics, now headquartered in Toronto. The company aims to treat heart disease and degenerative brain diseases.

""We were very excited about what we were able to accomplish with relatively modest funding,"" said Stewart.

The institute was created in 2014, with a promise from the Wynne government of $25 million over five years.

Stewart said he is hopeful the government can be persuaded to renew OIRM's funding instead of stopping it.

""We have a year, and a year is a long time in politics,"" said Stewart.

""We're hoping to use that time to try to position ourselves to continue in some way. Unfortunately, we have no idea what will happen after that."""

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

But the name on the cards he placed in the hands of residents and slide into the cracks of door frames is not his, it is that of Progressive Conservative MPP Robin Martin. The goal of this campaign is to save Toronto from the senseless and dangerous budget cuts imposed by the province.

In an unprecedented move, Tory went door-to-door to encourage residents to fight back.

This is not a one-off photo opportunity, the mayor said as the canvas began in the pouring rain.

“We’re going to be doing this for as long as we have to in different parts of the city.”

Face time with residents is the latest effort in the city’s clash with the province that has included back-and-forth letters, a war of words via TV news, public statements with other municipal leaders and recently a city-issued petition.

Senior officials say the city faces $177 million in provincial cuts for programs affecting child care, public health and more.

Tory, who was joined by local Councillor Mike Colle and about 25 volunteers and members of his own staff, met residents in Lytton Park, near Avenue Rd. and Glencairn Ave., with a purposely positive message. Saying Martin was a “good person,” Tory asked residents to call or write their provincial representative to encourage her to help reverse the cuts.

“We’re not here to sort of attack anybody,” Tory told those gathered to knock on doors.

Later he told reporters in reference to the MPPs in Toronto ridings: “A lot of these people were very narrowly elected the last time and I hope that they’ll be mindful not only of their own political position but also of the rights and wrongs of this.”

In the pocket of Eglinton-Lawrence that Tory visited Saturday, he had residents’ support.

“I told him I’m very grateful and, you know, my family’s very grateful for having an articulate spokesperson for the city and all the things the city stands for,” said Glenn Miller, who didn’t vote for the PC candidate in the last provincial election and isn’t likely to in the future. “There’s so many threads in the city that need sustaining, quite literally, that we don’t want to see them unilaterally cut.”

Kelly Monaghan had heard about the cuts before Tory arrived at her home and had planned to contact her MPP, Martin.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

“I was very disappointed, as the mayor just indicated, that it was done sort of after the budgets had been set ,” she said. “It doesn’t make any sense to me in terms of how to govern, in terms of how to appropriately allocate the resources.”

In one case, the mayor’s efforts quickly preceded him.

After one resident opened the door for Tory and the mayor began to make his pitch, the man cut in: “We just saw that on the news.”

Sen. Kim Pate says the Trudeau government’s Bill C-83 only offers a cosmetic rebranding of the practice of separating inmates from others in isolated cells for administrative or disciplinary reasons.

Pate was the executive director of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, which work with women in the criminal-justice system, before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau named her to the Senate as an independent in 2016.

Currently, inmates in segregation are restricted to two hours a day outside their cells and do not have access to meaningful interactions with others, nor do they benefit from programming or mental-health supports. According to recent numbers released to the parliamentary budget office, the number of inmates in segregation at any given time has varied from 360 to 434. Nearly all are men.

“Over four decades, I have spent countless hours kneeling on cement floors outside segregation cells, pleading through meal slots in solid metal doors as someone’s loved one — someone’s child, sibling, parent or partner — smashed their heads against cement walls or floors, slashed their bodies, tied ligatures or put nooses around their necks, tried to gouge out their own eyes, mutilated themselves in sometimes unimaginable ways, or smeared blood and feces on their bodies, windows and walls,” Pate said in a speech in the Senate on Thursday. “I have heard indescribable sounds of torment and despair that reverberate and haunt me.”

Last October, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale announced Bill C-83 would end the practice of isolating prisoners who pose risks to security or themselves — changes aimed at addressing recommendations from the coroner’s inquest into the 2007 death of Ashley Smith.

Smith, who was 19, strangled herself in a segregation cell at Grand Valley Institution in Kitchener, Ont., as prison guards looked on. She had spent more than 1,000 days in segregation before her death.

An Ontario coroner’s inquest in 2013 ruled her death a homicide and made 104 recommendations, including the banning of indefinite solitary confinement.

Under Bill C-83, prisoners transferred to structured intervention units will be permitted to spend four hours a day outside their cells, during which time they would be guaranteed a minimum of two hours to interact with others. Inmates in these units are also supposed to be visited daily by health professionals and see patient advocates.

The bill was adopted by the House of Commons and is now before the Senate.

Pate says the fine print of the legislation does not deliver on Goodale’s promises. Provisions and procedural safeguards in the current law are being “watered down,” she says.

Under Bill C-83, segregation cells are just renamed as “structured intervention units,” Pate says. With no hard time limits on isolation or separation of inmates, which the current law has, the new legislation makes it easier to put someone in segregation, she argues.

She and other legal experts who have provided feedback on the bill say it would not withstand a constitutional challenge.

“I think it needs some very significant amendment. Otherwise all parliamentarians who vote for this bill as-is would be doing a major disservice to the country, because we would be knowingly passing unconstitutional legislation.”

Goodale was not available for an interview this week but his spokesman Scott Bardsley says the minister will discuss the bill with senators when it goes to the Senate committee on social affairs for further review.

As for constitutional concerns that courts have raised about the current system regarding a lack of oversight and a lack of meaningful human interaction for inmates in segregation, Bill C-83 directly addresses both, Bardsley says.

“The new system created by Bill C-83 will strengthen procedural safeguards by implementing binding external oversight, as well as regular reviews by the warden and the Commissioner (of corrections). And unlike with the current system, these oversight mechanisms will be enshrined in law.”

Pate and other senators have been visiting federal prisons as part of a broader study by the Senate human-rights committee.

Last week, Nova Scotia independent Sen. Colin Deacon published photos from a visit he made to the Nova Institution for Women in Truro, N.S. One showed a map given to the visiting senators by government officials indicating an outside yard for inmates that included a “garden and spirituality area,” The reality the senators encountered was a bare concrete pad.

“The objectives laid out by (Correctional Services Canada) and its staff are great. Their ability to consistently act (to) achieve those objectives seems constrained,”Deacon wrote.

Pate produces more photographs showing institution after institution she has visited where segregation cells have been re-categorized as “structured intervention units” with minimal changes.

“I’ve literally been chasing around saying, ‘Where are these new units?’ There’s no new units, just new names.”

A recent parliamentary budget office report Pate commissioned found that the operating costs for the structured intervention units would be $58 million annually.

Pate asked for costings of three alternatives. Placing profoundly mentally ill inmates in psychiatric hospitals would cost $900 a day per inmate, the PBO found. Placements with correctional services on First Nations would cost $300 a day per inmate. A national anti-gang program in prisons would cost about $200,000.

Determining whether those moves would save money is difficult, the PBO report says — that depends on how well they work.

Pate wants the government and her Senate colleagues to take a closer look at alternative measures rather than passing Bill C-83 in its current form.

“The minister says he wants to get rid of segregation. I fully support that and think that’s fantastic. But the pretext that this bill is going to do it … if he actually believes that, I don’t think he has actually gone into any of the prisons to see what they’re now going to call structured intervention units.”

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-working-with-harper-1.5128872,"Uh, yikes.",1.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."
https://globalnews.ca/news/5310901/canada-privacy-passwords-law/,"With weed being legal now, I think criminalizing the act of forgetting is a bad idea.",13.0,49.0,"If someone was accused of a crime and police suspected that evidence could be found on their phone, would it surprise you to learn that the police can order them to provide their password?

Following Britain’s lead, Australia recently passed a law that allows police to compel decryption, which means forcing an accused person to provide their password or unlock a device. However, in Canada and the United States — countries with a constitutional bill of rights — courts are divided on whether compelling a person to reveal their password should be legal.

The issue comes up in cases where police need evidence on a laptop or phone that no company or agency can help them retrieve without a password, or without possibly destroying the data.

Does ordering you to hand over your password entail a form of self-incrimination or a violation of the right to silence? Would granting police the power to compel passwords cross a line centuries old against forcing a person to speak to build the case against them? Or should rights act as a trump card, effectively shutting down prosecutions — leaving victims without justice and shielding criminals from the law?

Story continues below advertisement

A recent Ontario case is the first in Canada to deal with the matter directly, and highlights what’s at stake. As a law professor focusing on technology and rights, I was keen to see how the court would resolve these issues.

Warrants for electronic data

In the 2019 case of R v. Shergill, the accused was charged with a series of sexual and child pornography offences involving a 15-year-old girl. Police obtained his phone upon arrest and a warrant to search it, but couldn’t open it without a password.

There are at present no powers in Canadian law that explicitly authorize police to compel an accused to provide a password or unlock a device. But courts do have the power to compel a person to help police do something to execute a warrant.

The Crown in Shergill asked the judge for an assistance order that would compel the accused to open his phone. In response, the defence argued that doing so would offend Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Drawing on American case law, the Crown responded that an order to compel a password would be Charter-compliant for two reasons.

Complying with the Charter

First, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not rule out all forms of compulsion: it permits an accused person to be forced to provide fingerprints, breath and DNA samples. It only prevents the Crown from compelling the accused to testify.

The Crown conceded that handing over a password is a form of testimony, but says the data on the phone is not. Since the data existed before the investigation, compelling an accused person to reveal their password does not force the accused to assist in creating the evidence against them; it only forces them to reveal that they know the password, a fact the court can exclude from the evidence considered in the trial.

Some scholars have gone further, arguing that a password shouldn’t even be considered testimony, since it doesn’t serve the same expressive function as other forms of speech traditionally protected under the Constitution, such as art or political opinion.

The purpose of compelling an accused to reveal their password is not to conscript the accused in helping the prosecution build a case: it simply enables the state to access evidence to which it is lawfully entitled.

The weight of tradition

Justice Philip Downes, who presided over R v. Shergill, disagreed, setting out reasons that closely parallel the prevailing view on password compulsion in U.S. courts.

The act of providing a password or unlocking a phone is a form of testimony, because it entails communicating something that exists only in one’s mind. It is closer in nature to revealing the combination of a safe rather than handing over a physical key.

The data on a phone is also closely tied to the password. In practical terms, since police are unlikely to access the phone’s data without the password, it is unrealistic to say that when an accused is compelled to unlock a phone, the data pre-exists being compelled to do so. Essentially, by handing over their password, the accused creates the evidence used against them.

The judge conceded that encryption poses a serious hurdle for police. Constitutional rights should not serve as an absolute trump card over the state’s interest. But the breach of the accused’s rights here was fundamental in nature and the weight of authority favoured the accused.

Passwords as testimony

The debate in Canada and the U.S. over whether password compulsion is legal turns on the same core issues: is a password a form of testimony? Does the accused help to create the case against them by unlocking a phone? And what is the state’s interest here? Does encryption pose an insurmountable hurdle to prosecution, or is it often only a matter of convenience?

Some law scholars argue that with an ever-growing abundance of other sources of data, compelled decryption is really only a matter of convenience. Others argue that in serious cases — murder, sexual assault — we can’t always find a true substitute for the data we fail to access behind encryption.

One possible way forward is to engage in a balancing of interests on a case-by-case basis, similar to what we do when we decide whether evidence obtained in violation of rights should still be admissible. In each case, we could weigh the severity of the breach with the seriousness of the offence.

Regardless of the solution, however, the problem that data encryption poses to law enforcement continues to pose a challenge. For a society that values the rule of law, it will force us to make hard choices between liberty and justice.

Right now.
I'm sitting in class with 33 other people",1.0,101.0,"A Calgary-area mother who spoke out to CBC News over concerns about a large combined Grade 2 class at Red Deer Lake School has been handed a cease-and-desist letter by a law firm on behalf of the school board.

The letter — served on behalf of the Foothills School Division — was written by Brownlee LLP, a large Edmonton law firm, and penned two days after CBC's original story was published.

""It's an example of trying to squash a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Gillian Colborne, one of the mothers who spoke to CBC News after pulling her son from the class over concerns he was struggling in a large room with 47 kids and two teachers.

Colborne, who has another child attending the school, says parents have been trying to get answers from the school division for months, and she was surprised to receive the three-page cease-and-desist letter.

Other parents have also received the letter and are not willing to be interviewed as a result.

""We are parents attempting to advocate for our children in a very calm open manner,"" said Colborne. ""It just seems unnecessary. I would have expected somebody to come to us and say, 'Oh, these are real and valid concerns you have. Let's sit down and talk about them.'""

Parents could be banned from school

The letter accuses parents of making false allegations in communications to various parties. It claims they've made defamatory comments, filed malicious complaints and says that they could be banned from the school. It also threatens legal action if they don't refrain from repeating or publishing their comments.

""Your advocacy has exceeded the boundaries of productive dialogue and devolved into disparaging the professional reputation of well-respected educators,"" the letter states.

It goes on to say the Foothills School Division has responded to each concern relating to their children. It accuses the parents of repeatedly pressuring school staff members through text messages, emails — as well as in person — and says several staff members claim they felt ""unduly pressured by your relentless tactics.""

""To be clear, you are to cease sending all e-mail or other correspondence that contains false or defamatory comments regarding any Foothills School Division employee to anyone. Any failure on your part to take heed of this warning may result in legal proceedings.""

The Foothills School division declined CBC's request for an interview. In a written statement, a spokesperson says: ""At times actions must be taken to ensure that third parties do not negatively impact a school environment and workplace.""

""We feel that we have fully addressed any questions surrounding the Grade 2 classroom configuration at Red Deer Lake School,"" the email states.

""We maintain that it is an effective learning environment. As we stated previously, all parents are welcome to continue to discuss with their child's teacher(s) and school administration any concerns they have about their child's learning.""

Barbara Silva with Support Our Students Alberta calls the cease-and-desist letters 'heavy-handed.' (CBC)

Letter called 'heavy-handed'

""It seems like a very heavy-handed way to shut this conversation down,"" said Barbara Silva, communications director with Support Our Students Alberta. ""Once you bring in legal counsel, it sets up a David and Goliath dynamic.""

Silva says she believes the parents' concerns about a large combined classroom are ""well-founded"" and exist around the province.

While her organization regularly hears from parents who feel their concerns aren't taken seriously by school divisions, Silva says she's never heard of a division taking this kind of legal step.

""Just the sheer image of a school board putting out cease-and-desist orders is pretty alarming,"" said Silva, who admits she isn't privy to all the communications that have occurred between the parents, the school and the school division.

""It puts parents in a position that either they're not going to come forward with their concerns, or they understand really clearly they're going to need to get legal counsel to do so. And that's going to make sure that a lot of people don't come forward with their concerns.""

Pakistani officials and others involved in the case said Wednesday that Asia Bibi had left Pakistan to be reunited with her daughters in Canada, where they had been granted asylum. Her lawyer, Saif-ul Malook, said she had already arrived in Canada.

Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2009 after a quarrel with a fellow farmworker. Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction last year and she had been in protective custody since then.

Islamic extremists have rioted over the case and threatened to kill her. The same radical Islamists, many of whom have been jailed for their threats, also urged the overthrow of the government following Bibi's acquittal.

Wilson Chawdhry of the British Pakistani Christian Association told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he received a text message from a British diplomat saying ""Asia is out."" A close friend of Bibi also confirmed that she had left the country, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

A statement from the association says it received confirmation around 8 p.m. ET Tuesday that Bibi ""had safely exited Pakistan.""

""Asia Bibi bravely held on to her faith through the most brutal of incarcerations that involved her having access to sunlight for two hours per month,"" the statement says. ""Now she finally travels to Canada to be reunited with her children.""

Chowdhry said in the statement released by the association that Bibi is ""unwell"" after suffering a decade of isolation both in and out of captivity.

""She must be treated with utmost care and receive appropriate medical care now she is free,"" he said.

Officials at Pakistan's interior and foreign ministries also confirmed her departure, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would not discuss the case Wednesday.

""I have no comment,"" Trudeau said. ""Obviously, there are sensitive privacy issues and security issues on this and unfortunately I can't comment at this time.""

Global Affairs Canada said Wednesday it ""has no comment on this matter."" Trudeau said last November that Canada was then in talks with the Pakistani government about Bibi.

The friend, who last spoke to her on Tuesday, said Bibi and her husband Ashiq Masih had spent the last several weeks getting their documents in order. He said she was longing to see her daughters, with whom she talked almost daily from her secure location, protected by Pakistani security forces.

Chawdhry said he had been in regular contact with Bibi's husband throughout the ordeal as well as with several diplomats involved in international efforts to get her to safety.

The case has brought international attention to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, which carries an automatic death penalty. The mere suspicion of blasphemy against Islam is enough to ignite mob lynchings in the country. The accusation of blasphemy has also been used to intimidate religious minorities and to settle scores.

Radical Islamists have made the punishment of blasphemy a major rallying cry, bringing tens of thousands into the streets and paralyzing major cities.

Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, has been celebrated as a martyr by hardliners since he was hanged for the killing, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Pakistan's minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated later that year after demanding justice for Bibi.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed not to be intimidated by the rioters, saying the rule of law would decide Bibi's fate. But she was denied permission to leave the country for several months until sentiments cooled.

A three-judge Supreme Court panel in January cleared Bibi's final legal hurdle when they ruled there was no compelling reason to overturn the court's earlier acquittal. The judges accused those who charged Bibi with blasphemy of committing perjury, but said they would not be tried because of the sensitivity of the case. The judges upheld the blasphemy law."

The province's top court was asked to weigh in on proposed amendments to B.C.'s Environmental Management Act forcing anyone wanting to transport increased quantities of ""heavy oil"" to seek provincial permission.

While B.C.'s attorney general argues the government has the right to enact laws aimed at protecting British Columbians from the effects of a catastrophic spill, Ottawa claims the move is a ruse designed with just one target in mind: the proposed twinning of a 1,150 pipeline to move bitumen from Edmonton to the West Coast.

The case revolves around weighty legal and constitutional issues, but it boils down to a few fundamental questions about the role of government in the lives of Canadians — and the balance between local and national interests.

He claimed their arguments all boiled down to one thing:

""That even if the pipelines or railways they own or operate create a risk of even catastrophic environmental harm because of the substance they carry, the province is nevertheless powerless to enact laws to prevent that risk from materializing,"" Arvay told the five appeal court judges.

""We say that the province is not required to accept such a fate.""

'A Trojan horse'

The appeal court battle is the latest in a series of legal and political hurdles the pipeline expansion has faced since then-owner Kinder Morgan first lodged its plans with the National Energy Board (NEB) in 2013.

Last year, the federal government announced plans to buy the $4.5 billion pipeline from Kinder Morgan shareholders, who expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the approval process.

The Federal Court of Appeal put the project on hold in 2018 after finding that the government had not adequately consulted with First Nations and the NEB had failed to fully consider impacts on marine life.

Ottawa has since moved to rectify those shortcomings.

The reference question was debated over five days in March. It's one of the rare proceedings B.C.'s appeal court has decided to webcast.

Jan Brongers, lawyer for Canada's attorney general, acknowledged the ""superficial attraction"" of Arvay's argument. But he warned the judges against falling for it.

""Our main concern is that this legislation appears to be a Trojan horse,"" he said.

""It's one that's designed to appear as constitutionally acceptable local environmental protection measures, but in substance it's an unconstitutional initiative whose only logical reason for being is to limit federally regulated pipelines and railways from moving additional quantities of heavy oil.""

The court has been asked to consider three basic questions:

Does B.C. have the authority to enact the proposed amendments?

Would those rules apply to ""heavy oil"" from another province?

Would existing federal legislation trump the provincial rules in any event?

The federal government argued that it has exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines and railways, and that B.C.'s legislation is simply a bid to kill a project the provincial NDP government vigorously opposes.

But Arvay claimed B.C. isn't trying to usurp Ottawa's power — that instead the proposed amendments would work in tandem with federal laws to ensure locals are protected from the risks of projects in their backyards.

""Decisions affecting individuals should as far as reasonably possible be made by the level of government closest to the individuals affected,"" he told the court.

Strange bedfellows

A host of intervenors have lined up on either side of the debate, with the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby supporting British Columbia along with the Assembly of First Nations.

""Local governments and First Nations governments are on the front lines of emergency response for their communities,"" the City of Vancouver said in its written arguments.

""It is these communities that are at risk from a heavy oil accident and who will suffer the impacts.""

Several individual First Nations have also aligned themselves with the government of Canada, along with a number of oil and gas industry groups and the attorneys general of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Alberta said the provinces and Ottawa should work together to protect the environment, but B.C. can't take unilateral steps that would result in the obstruction or delay of the project.

Regardless of what the appeal court decides, the ultimate decision on the law is likely to rest with the Supreme Court of Canada."

It is something he’s done at least twice now and on huge national files we’ve never seen before.",10.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

That's how Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research, sees the Newfoundland and Labrador provincial election after a poll conducted among 856 potential voters was released on Thursday.

Among decided or leaning voters polled, 42 per cent support the Progressive Conservatives, while the Liberals hold 40 per cent, the New Democrats are at 13 per cent, and six per cent selected ""other"" options.

A few seats for the third party could mean the difference between a majority and a minority. - Lorne Bozinoff

The difference between the two leading parties is within the margin of error — plus or minus three per cent, 19 times out of 20 — meaning it's too close to confidently say one party is leading over the other.

The poll did not account for undecided voters. When asked why, Bozinoff told The St. John's Morning Show it didn't matter.

""We take them out because we believe at the end of the day, most of the undecideds will vote the way everyone else will vote. They'll break basically in the same proportions, or they won't vote.""

Of the 856 respondents, only 79 said they were undecided, leaving 91 per cent of people decided or leaning.

Based on the 777 respondents counted in the results, Forum Research estimates the PCs will win 19 seats, the Liberals 18 and the NDP three.

""What will be fascinating to watch is how the NDP will factor into the final results,"" Bozinoff said. ""Even just a few seats for the third party could mean the difference between a majority and a minority government.""

This is the third poll released in Newfoundland and Labrador this week, with each showing different results.

Abacus Data had the PCs five percentage points higher than the Liberals among decided voters, while MQO suggested the Liberals had a 12-point lead over the PCs — again, among decided voters.

Forum Research was the only group of pollsters to accurately predict the PC party was leading in the recent Prince Edward Island election.

Trouble for Liberals in central

The polling suggests the strongest support for the PCs is in ""central Newfoundland and Grand Falls-Windsor,"" where most districts are currently red.

Forum Research says 48 per cent of respondents in the region support the PC party, whereas support for the Liberals is at 37 per cent.

The west coast of Newfoundland shows the strongest support for the Liberals, with 45 per cent of respondents saying they'd vote red.

More than half dissatisfied with all leaders

While the numbers for party support is close, the number of people disapproving of all three party leaders is even closer.

""None of them did that well,"" Bozinoff said.

The poll suggested 63 per cent of respondents disapprove of the job Dwight Ball has done as premier, while 37 per cent support him.

For Ches Crosbie, 55 per cent of people disapprove of his abilities to lead the Progressive Conservative party, while 45 per cent approve.

Leaders Alison Coffin, Dwight Ball and Ches Crosbie are vying for the top job in the province. (CBC)

For the NDP, 52 per cent disapprove of Alison Coffin's job as leader, while 48 per cent approve.

About 40 per cent of respondents didn't think there was a winner at the leader's debate broadcast by CBC and NTV on May 1.

When asked if they thought Newfoundland and Labrador was better or worse off than it was four years ago, 66 per cent said worse, with 42 per cent saying ""much worse.""

A man and woman are facing dozens of charges in connection to a human trafficking investigation that police said involved a teenager in the sex trade.

In February, police apprehended a 15-year-old girl after police and the human trafficking and exploitation unit became aware she was allegedly getting involved in the sex trade.

An investigation revealed that between December 2018 and March 2019, a man and woman recruited, procured and trafficked the 15-year-old and another 16-year-old girl from a home in central Edmonton, according to police.

“Human trafficking isn’t always an elaborate, organized operation like you see in the movies; it can be two people exploiting victims in a residence or hotel room next door,” Det. Dan Duiker said.

“If you notice unusual or suspicious activity, report it to police. A dispute between a couple could be much more than meets the eye. Your report could save a vulnerable youth from going down a path they can’t escape.”

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-defence-committee-1.5138975,Shockingly similar to what is happening in the US. ��,-9.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

The Mounties released a statement last week defending their handling of the case and — as late as Monday — had turned aside further requests for comment."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,it just doesn't make sense not to post the photo of the person who said the headline quote (which is taken out of context for maximum shock value),20.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

So the clergy of mainstream religions like Anglicanism?",2.0,63.0,"A former German teacher in a southern Alberta Hutterite community who terrorized and abused children for more than a decade has pleaded guilty to seven counts of assault with a weapon.

Johan Hofer, 48, admitted to beating children in the Waterton Hutterite Colony and in his class with straps, tree branches — and in one case, burning them with a lighter to show them how hot hell would be.

Judge Derek Redman of the Provincial Court of Alberta imposed a two-year conditional sentence order, meaning Hofer will serve his sentence in the community under conditions that include house arrest for 12 months and a curfew for the remaining year.

Because of the abuse they suffered between 2002 and 2013, several children left the colony at Hill Spring, Alta. — some 70 kilometres southwest from Lethbridge — before their 18th birthdays to get away from Hofer, according to the facts read aloud by the prosecutor.

Dozens of male ministers from Hutterite colonies across the Prairies showed up in court, filling the room.

When asked their opinions on Hofer staying in the community, one elder from Waterton said the case has been ""very, very emotional for the colony and for the church.""

If he causes no arguments, ""it will be for the good to come together as one family to serve our heavenly father,"" said the elder.

Whipped, humiliated

Since the charges were laid, many of the victims' families have been ostracized from the community, according to prosecutor Darwyn Ross.

Hofer was to go on trial this week on 14 counts of assault with a weapon but pleaded to half the counts instead.

The court heard Tuesday what some of the victims endured.

In several cases, Hofer would have children kneel on the hard tile for the duration of his class. Often he would have his victims — who ranged in ages from six to 14 — bend over a stool and would whip them with a leather strap in front of their classmates.

The children described feeling not only intense physical pain but also humiliation.

""Most days I was afraid to leave the house,"" wrote one of Hofer's victims in an impact statement.

The boy, whose identity is protected by a publication ban, said his days always ended in tears and he felt as though he had nowhere to hide.

'Did not intend to hurt the children'

One girl said the pain was often a 10 out of 10 after Hofer hit her hands and backside with a belt, tree branches and yardsticks.

Another victim described being hit in the side with a stick so hard he bled through his shirt. The boy was guilty, in Hofer's opinion, of failing to write out his German verses quickly enough.

Redman asked the lawyers involved if Hofer simply ""went way too far"" in his effort to discipline.

Defence lawyer Adriano Iovinelli agreed with the judge's suggestion.

""My client did not intend to hurt the children,"" said Iovinelli. ""The intent was for the discipline.""

Iovinelli compared his client's actions to old-school corporal punishment, which the senior defence lawyer said even he suffered as a child."

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

READ MORE: Atlantic Canada clean energy collaboration receives $2M federal investment

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

Used fuel from the Bruce Power plant is stored in the form of pellets that fit into tubes. These tubes are collected into bundles and packed into carbon steel tubes coated in copper. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository.

https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/05/16/trudeau-takes-aim-at-big-tech-announces-digital-charter.html,Feel free to leave.,-3.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-philpott-federal-election-1.5149284,Boom! Mic drop!,2.0,41.0,"Former Liberal cabinet members Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott say they will make announcements Monday about their political futures.

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."

Trudeau is a corrupt little boy with absolutely no integrity.,19.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

But Canada will always be better than 99% of the world.",1.0,12.0,"After years of keeping silent, Inuit from Igloolik, Nunavut, say they want answers about medical tests performed on them in the late 1960s and early '70s.

Nearly 50 years ago, the hamlet of Igloolik was the site of a boom in scientific research, all part of a larger project called the International Biological Program. While the program was aimed at answering a wide array of scientific questions, much of the work in Igloolik focused on Inuit.

""We would do all these different kinds of things for a researcher,"" said former Nunavut premier Paul Quassa, who grew up in Igloolik.

In the early '70s he was a young man, spending his days going to school and hunting. He remembers researchers being in the community and doing experiments — he says some were merely inconvenient and annoying, but others were more invasive.

Quassa remembers being taken to a research building with his uncle and his cousin. There, they were told to roll up their sleeves.

Three Inuit show scars from skin graft procedures they say were done by researchers in the 1960s and 1970s. The photos were taken about a month ago; CBC News has agreed not to identify the people pictured. (Submitted by Steven Cooper)

""They took pieces of our skin, from another person, and then they put into ours,"" said Quassa.

""They had a little circular knife or blade, and they would just start twisting it and then you could see the skin being cut in a circle.""

The scars from the skin graft are still visible on his forearm.

We are not animals, we are another human being that deserves respect. - Paul Quassa

He described another instance where he had been out hunting one February, wearing caribou clothing. When he got back, researchers made him stand outside for 20 minutes before letting him inside. Quassa suspects they were testing his ability to withstand the cold.

Quassa says he never gave his consent to be experimented on; he says Inuit were very compliant and trusting back then, and they did what they were told.

'It was really unfair'

The International Biological Program was a large-scale multi-year project aimed at co-ordinating research among scientists worldwide. It looked at everything from pest control to pollution and how people adapted to their environments.

A 1970 article on the program published in Science said studies on ""Eskimos, South American Indians, migrants and populations living at high altitude … include not only the health of these populations but also social conditions, nutritional patterns [and] biological rhythms.""

I was grafted with part of the skin of my sister. - Lazarie Uttak

It's estimated that researchers did the skin grafting experiment on more than 30 Inuit from Igloolik, including Lazarie Uttak.

""I was grafted with part of the skin of my sister,"" said Uttak. ""I feel like we were being used.""

Uttak, 67, still lives in Igloolik and says at least 15 of the people who were experimented on are still alive in the hamlet today.

""We talk about this sometimes,"" he said. ""It was really unfair. We never got any information from them about why this was happening and the reason why they did it. I never found out.""

2005 book outlines tests

The experiments in Igloolik are outlined in the 2005 book Beyond the Hippocratic Oath: A Memoir on the Rise of Modern Medical Ethics by Dr. John B. Dossetor, a celebrated Canadian physician who was inducted into the Order of Canada in 1994.

In it, Dossetor describes participating in the large research mission, travelling to Igloolik in 1972 and performing a series of skin grafts on Inuit.

Dossetor and his colleagues were studying why some skin grafts work while others fail, and they wanted to test their theories on an isolated human population.

Dossetor was a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta at the time. He went on to become an expert in medical ethics.

Igloolik has a population of about 1,600. (CBC)

In his book, Dossetor writes that his research in Igloolik received ""community consent,"" which he said was granted by elders via a non-Inuk translator. At the time Dossetor felt that was sufficient.

The doctor confronts the ethics of his research in the book, ultimately concluding that his team had not done enough to secure meaningful consent, though Quassa and Uttak say he never made any attempts to reach out or apologize to those he experimented on.

Dossetor is in his early 90s, living in Ottawa. He declined an interview request.

Memoir is 'sickening'

Representatives from the federal Department of Indigenous Services and from Health Canada both declined to comment.

In an email, the director of the University of Alberta's Research Ethics Office, Susan Babcock, said the university did not have a formal research ethics review process in 1972. It wasn't until 1978 that the Medical Research Council of Canada put together the first framework for ethical requirements for human participation in research.

""The research conducted by Dr. Dossetor in the early 1970s would be reviewed and undertaken differently now,"" wrote Babcock.

The university's ethics office has no record of anyone expressing concerns about Dossetor's work.

Quassa says the details revealed in Dossetor's memoir are ""sickening.""

Quassa shot back at the doctor's concept of ""community consent."" He questions what details were actually shared with locals in Inuktitut, and dismissed the idea that elders could unilaterally grant consent for invasive medical procedures.

""I've heard of scientists doing experiments on monkeys — they use animals to do a lot of experiments for the betterment of humankind,"" he said.

""We are not monkeys, we are not animals, we are another human being that deserves respect.""

Quassa, Uttak and other Igloolik Inuit are considering their legal options. They are working with an Edmonton-based law firm to potentially seek an apology and damages."

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

Bernier has so far failed to parlay the significant political capital he had accumulated as a CPC leadership front-runner into a lasting electoral down payment for his People’s Party. If anything, he has depleted that capital.

Two years ago, one in two Conservative members supported Bernier’s bid to succeed Stephen Harper. For 12 of the 13 ballots it took to declare a winner, the leadership was his to lose.

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Maxime Bernier fails to gain momentum in Conservative territory

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

Since Bernier set out on his own last summer, Scheer’s Conservatives have vaulted to first place in voting intentions. Over the first quarter of this year, they raised more money than the ruling Liberals. Over the same period, Scheer’s personal ratings have improved while Bernier’s star has faded.

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

Calgary police have found the bodies of a woman and child, believed to be 25-year-old Jasmine Lovett and her 22-month-old daughter Aliyah Sanderson.

The bodies were found on Monday at 4 a.m. about 50 kilometres west of the city in a wooded area in Kananaskis Country near Grizzly Creek, according to police.

More than 50 police officers and officials were involved in an extensive search of an area that spanned Bragg Creek and Priddis in the days that followed the disappearance of the mother and daughter.

Staff Sgt. Martin Schiavetta said the man previously identified as the “primary suspect” in the case was re-arrested at about 11 a.m. Monday and is facing two charges of second-degree murder.

Lovett and Sanderson were reported missing on April 23 after they didn’t show up for a family dinner. They were last seen a week prior, on April 16, according to police. Their disappearance was declared a suspected double-homicide on April 25.

The family of Sanderson told Global News on Monday morning they had met with investigators and were notified the bodies were found in Kananaskis Country and an arrest had been made.

In an emailed statement sent through Calgary police, the Lovett family thanked officers and anyone else who helped in the search for their loved ones.

“We would also like to thank the public for their continued support, which has meant a great deal to us,” the statement read.

“Our lives have been devastated and our hearts are heavy. We are trying to understand how this tragedy could have happened to our loved ones.” Tweet This

The bodies were removed from the wooded area Monday morning and autopsies began once they arrived back in Calgary. Formal identification will be done by the medical examiner, which Schiavetta said could likely come on Tuesday. The cause of death is not expected to be released.

Schiavetta said investigators were “satisfied” to find the bodies, but said the discovery is a difficult one.

“It’s a very sad feeling when you have to notify the families of that,” Schiavetta said.

“There are a lot of similarities in this case to other domestic homicides that our officers have investigated. I can tell you that the officers that were in Kananaskis last night obviously had a very difficult time when they discovered the bodies.”

Later that day, Robert Leeming — who Global News confirmed to be the owner of a home in Cranston that was subject to extensive forensic investigation in the case — told media he was arrested and questioned by police in relation to the suspected homicides, before being released a day later.

Police were led to the Bragg Creek area after cellphone pings were identified in the area. On April 29, investigators said the destruction of evidence “by means of burning” was thought to have happened in the area of Bragg Creek, Elbow Falls, Priddis and/or East Kananaskis sometime between Tuesday, April 16 and Saturday, April 20.

Police said investigators would not release information on how the bodies were discovered to “protect the integrity of the investigation and future court proceedings.”

“I can tell you the investigative process picked up momentum over the past few days which led us to locate the bodies early this morning,” Schiavetta said. Tweet This

In aerial footage from the Global1 helicopter, several police officers could be seen canvassing large swaths of ground and a number of marked and unmarked police vehicles could be seen on the side of the highway.

The collision reconstruction team was brought in to help, as Schiavetta said their analysis and skills are occasionally also used for crime scene construction.

The search for any evidence related to the disappearance of Lovett and Sanderson had been hampered by bad weather for a week, but Schiavetta said the area the bodies were found didn’t have as much snow as what searchers encountered in the Bragg Creek area.

The deficit is projected to INCREASE under his watch.,19.0,43.0,"The Ford government is reducing funding for children and youth at risk by $84.5 million, according to an analysis of provincial spending estimates by the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies.

The reduction includes a $28 million cut to the $1.5 billion the province gives 49 children’s aid societies in Ontario, increasing concerns about the ability of agencies to serve and protect vulnerable children. The cut comes as 18 child protection agencies struggle with deficits totalling more than $12 million.

The deficits have already forced some agencies to lay off staff and reduce the number of children at risk they take into care.

“A decrease in children in care does not mean there are fewer children in need of protection,” the OACAS warned in a PowerPoint produced in late March, outlining its core messages before the provincial budget was tabled.

The association’s post-budget analysis suggests their warning may not have been heard.

The $84.5 million cut for youth at risk is contained in a May 16 “briefing note” the OACAS sent to top CAS officials, and obtained by the Star. The calculations are based on the government’s operating and capital spending estimates tabled in the legislature May 9.

Anti-poverty advocates shaken by cuts contemplated by Ford government

Opinion | Martin Regg Cohn: Secret document shows how far Doug Ford’s Tories would cut social services — until they were talked back from the brink

The OACAS calculated funding envelopes that fall under the budget line of “child and youth at risk,” including services for child protection and youth involved with the justice system.

The association is uncertain about the full impact of the cuts. Some funding envelopes have been eliminated and new ones created. It’s unclear if programs funded under the eliminated envelopes will continue to be funded under the new ones. Some of the cuts may involve the closing of unused facilities or resources, particularly in the area of youth justice. But when all the pluses and minuses are calculated, the funding shortfall is $84.5 million, according to the OACAS.

“We are concerned about the impact of any potential cuts to our members and to the families that they serve,” Nicole Bonnie, chief executive officer of the OACAS said in an email response to questions.

“At this time we do not have details as to which programs will be funded or who will deliver them,” Bonnie added. “We are waiting for more detailed information from the ministry to understand the exact nature of the impact on child welfare.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Bonnie hopes to soon meet with Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. “Our message is and always has been that the children and families we serve are the most marginalized and disenfranchised, and programs that support their well-being need to be fully funded.”

The minister’s office did not respond to direct questions about the cuts. In an emailed statement, MacLeod’s press secretary, Derek Rowland, described the well-being of vulnerable young people as the government’s “utmost priority.” The steady decline of children being taken into care since 2006, he added, has helped most children’s aid societies balance their budgets and the ministry is working with those that haven’t.

“We will be holding Ontario’s Children’s Aid Societies and other providers to higher standards to keep our kids safe,” Rowland said, denouncing what he described as “the lack of oversight and relaxed regulation” of the previous Liberal government.

Rowland said the government is increasing investments in prevention programs “to ensure kids keep out of trouble.” The government also “expects significant savings” in the youth justice sector after a review found “underutilized detention facilities.”

A plan to reduce the number of children’s aid societies through amalgamation is also being considered by the ministry.

What isn’t in doubt is that children’s aid societies will have less core funding to work with.

One children’s aid society, Brant Family and Children’s Services, has struggled with deficits that forced the layoff of 26 workers in March, in a community facing perhaps the worst opioid addiction epidemic in the province. Its executive director then posted a letter to the Brantford area community on the agency’s website, warning of serious consequences.

“When governments cut child welfare services (managers, front-line staff, and support services), children ultimately die or are allowed by society to live in unbearable, violent and neglectful conditions,” Andy Koster wrote.

“With higher caseloads and tight timelines, workers are forced to move from one crisis to another instead of planning and working proactively with families to prevent future incidents,” he added. “Despite best efforts, children fall through the cracks and suffer the consequences of insufficient resources.”

The cuts for children at risk also comes on the heels of the government eliminating the office that advocated for children and youth.

Kiaras Gharabaghi, director of Ryerson University’s School of Child and Youth Care, denounced the cuts as implemented without consultations.

“They are cuts that have no interest in making the system work better for kids and families,” he said in an interview after reviewing the OACAS document.

“This sector requires a different approach,” Gharabaghi added. “It’s one where young people die by violence, by suicide, by neglect. It’s not the same as increasing class sizes in schools to save some money.”

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-senate-resolution-charter-1.5128399,What a useful resolution! Just what we needed.,1.0,73.0,"The United States Senate has passed a resolution praising the Canadian government for the way it has conducted itself in the case of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

The resolution commends ""the government of Canada for upholding the rule of law and expressing concern over actions by the government of the People's Republic of China in response to a request from the United States government to the government of Canada for the extradition of a Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. executive.""

The resolution is nonbinding and is considered an expression of the Senate's will on the issue.

Canada has face widespread political and economic pressure from China since Meng's arrest in December and has been looking to its international allies for diplomatic assistance.

In February, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland met with U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, to ask for American help in its ongoing tussle with China over Meng's arrest. Risch ultimately introduced the Senate resolution.

Since Meng's arrest, China has placed a number of trade hurdles in front of Canadian exporters — banning imports from two canola producers, tying up shipments over paperwork and putting unusual obstacles in the way of Canadian soybean and pea exporters.

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December after Canadian officials detained Meng in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S. She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.

In March, China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him by Spavor.

'Arbitrary detention'

In December, a few months before that accusation was made, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Kovrig and Spavor were being unlawfully detained and should be returned to Canada.

That position was affirmed by the Senate Tuesday in a resolution that expressed concern over China's ""apparent arbitrary detention and abusive treatment of Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in apparent retaliation for the government of Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou.""

One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial in January. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling. Last month, a Chinese court sentenced another Canadian, Fan Wei, to death for participating in a global methamphetamine operation.

Meng's Charter of Rights defence

The resolution landed as Meng's defence team said it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the U.S. because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest at Vancouver's airport was unlawful.

Benjamin Howes, a spokesman for Huawei Canada, told reporters in Vancouver Wednesday that Meng's legal team will also argue that her rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated during her arrest.

""Ms. Meng intends to apply to the court for a stay of the extradition proceedings. Canadians value the rule of law and the Charter of Rights,"" he said.

""We have trust in the Canadian legal process and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored.""

According to the federal government's guide to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ""any person in Canada – whether they are a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident or a newcomer – has the rights and freedoms contained in the Charter.""

Seeking more documents

During a hearing Wednesday, Crown prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley, who is representing the Attorney General of Canada, asked Justice Heather Holmes to see that Meng's case proceeds as quickly as possible, proposing a first court date by the end of August.

He said the allegations against Meng centre on a misrepresentation she is alleged to have made to a bank that put the institution's economic interests at risk, adding it's not yet time to make arguments in the case.

The defence said it needs more time to gather documents through freedom of information requests. It also wants audio from Meng's questioning at the time of her arrest, which already has been described as unlawful in a civil suit."

The court delays mean the project will not be able to start construction in the U.S. this year, Paul Miller, president of liquids pipelines, confirmed during an afternoon conference call with financial analysts.

The project could still be unfinished if a new federal government is elected in the U.S. in 2020, he added, but it's hoped all permits and approvals will be in hand by then and a new administration won't affect bringing the project on stream.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,"&gt; It really isn't fair to ask that. Sure, ideally I want a non biased individual in any office setting, however expression of religion is still protected under the charter of rights..

There is also an expectation of constituents to be mature and not force their cultist beliefs to others",5.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Djemila Benhabib, representing the Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité, said Tuesday that some Muslim women who wear the hijab are 'fundamentalists.' (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/kenneth-harrisson-not-guilty-1.5146259,"Welp, he's a goner.",5.0,84.0,"A St. John's man accused of possessing child pornography in an unusual case involving what's been described as a child sex doll has been found not guilty.

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Lawyer Bob Buckingham, right, represented Harrisson at the trial in St. John's. (Mark Quinn/ CBC)

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

I'm still the only person on my road with no blue box come garbage day. It always seemed so robotic, watching the subdivision fill with blueboxes. Like a scene out of the Wall or a Kubrick movie. I felt wrong being a part of that.This is validating.",-1.0,134.0,"For the second time in five weeks, an angry government in Asia is demanding Canada take back unwanted waste.

First it was the Philippines — now Malaysia .

Many Canadians have been surprised — and unhappy — to learn that Canada sends vast amounts of its recyclable waste overseas.

They've been dutifully putting their plastic, glass and paper into the blue bin, believing they are doing the right thing for the environment. But the recycling process can be complicated, and the outcome isn't always as green as we might think.

What happens to what I put in the blue bin?

According to Myra Hird of the School of Environmental Studies at Queen's University, we don't really know.

""People think that when they put something in their recycling bin, it's actually going to be recycled. But this is not the case.""

She said the waste might be recycled, but everything depends on market value. (More on that later.)

You may be tossing your recyclables into a blue bin supplied by a municipal recycling program, but the municipal government's responsibility ends once the blue bin contents are sold to a recycling company. Waste and recycling is for the most part handled by private industry in Canada.

Canadian recycling companies take the material from municipal programs and sort it, clean it and compress it into smaller cubes. Those cubes are then put up for auction.

""[Municipalities] are only responsible for that first contract,"" said Hird. They need to know where the recycling and the waste first goes. After that, they're not responsible for knowing the rest of that chain.""

Recycling is a ritual in a lot of Canadian homes, and we do it with the best intentions. But intentions in our kitchens may not be good enough. Media ID: 2:20

Who buys it?

It might be bought by a Canadian company that will further process it into pellets that are sold to the plastics industry to be used in new products — such as pipes or plastic bags.

But it could also be bought by a recycling broker who will sell it again — often to companies overseas who seek to make a profit from it. All perfectly legal. But, said Hird, hard to follow.

""These brokers mean that these contracts can change hands several times between the source and the destination."" And, she said, there is no accountability.

For years, China was a huge market for the developed world's plastic waste, taking in about 45 per cent of the world's plastics waste since 1992 . But last year, China announced it no longer wants it. Canada, and other countries, needed to find new markets.

How is Canadian plastic waste ending up in Asian countries?

""We don't like to keep our waste around,"" said Hird, ""so we move it between regions. We transport waste to the United States, to South Korea, to obviously, Malaysia, the Philippines and elsewhere.""

And while companies in those countries may be willing to buy it, governments in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam started to crack down late last year — imposing bans and stricter regulations.

Malaysia's environment minister opened a container of contaminated Canadian plastic scrap at Port Klang. The country says it will send the unwanted waste back. (Eric Szeto/CBC)

Companies buy recyclable waste, because they can make money on it. This is where market value comes in. But recycling, said Hird, is not a stable industry.

""Something that we put in the recycling bin in January … that may get recycled if there's value in it, if there's a market in it."" But if there's no market, she said, then by November or December, that same material might be put in landfill because there's no longer a significant profit to be made.

What's more, said Martin Vogt, president of Ontario-based company EFS-plastics, overseas companies do not always recycle all of what we send. ""They're picking out the good plastics, and that plastic will be recycled. But most of it ends up in the oceans, in landfills … and sometimes it's burned.""

How much does Canada recycle itself?

Much less than you might think.

""Canada recycles only nine per cent of the plastic that we use here in this country,"" according to Keith Brooks of Environment Defence.

And Hird cautions that Canadians are not made aware of the costs of recycling. ""Recycling means changing that material, which often involves significant transportation.""

She uses an example of polystyrene — a standard, versatile foam plastic used to make everything from food containers to protective packaging — that is collected in Kingston.

""[It] gets shipped to northern Ontario using trucks that use non-renewable fossil fuels. It's then liquefied and made smaller, more compact, and then it's put on more trucks which are then taken to Montreal, which then are put on ships that go to the United States and go to South Korea. All of this for one more use for that polystyrene.""

So is recycling in Canada working?

According to Brooks, not really.

""We need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use. That means banning some plastic [by] the government. We need to hold producers responsible for this plastic ultimately — that's a really important thing. And we need government to take action to do that.

In British Columbia, legislation shifted the onus of handling recycling onto the businesses that create the waste, something known as ""extended producer responsibility."" Recycle B.C, a non-profit, took responsibility for the province's waste recycling about five years ago. It works to keep contamination levels low, so its recycled products are usually higher quality, making them easier to sell.

And Recycle B.C. spokesperson David Lefebvre told CBC News in April,""all of the plastic that's collected here in the province ends up here in B.C.""

There are calls for the Canadian government to create a stronger end market for recyclables, by making it mandatory for manufacturers to use a certain amount of recycled material in new products. (CBC News)

Is there a solution?

Vogt agrees the solution requires government involvement, but had a different take than Brooks.

He said governments need to, ""come out and say we need to have recycled content in our products in order to create the circle economy and basically get the industry going.""

But Brooks and Hird both say the real solution lies in reducing all waste, not relying on recycling."

In a recent application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Shaw's home satellite service advised the broadcast regulator it wanted to terminate the Local Television Satellite Solution (LTSS).

The LTSS provided minimum access to Canadian television services, including CBC, Radio-Canada, CTV, Global and Citytv. It was only available free if a household was in an area that previously received over-the-air signals free through an antenna, and lost them in 2011 when transmission converted to digital.

Unless I'm willing to give up some of the rent money, I have to accept that I will no longer be able to receive, as a Canadian, CBC programming. - Doug Grisack, LTSS subscriber in Lethbridge, Alta.

That conversion removed television service for rural Canadians across the country and viewers in both small cities and metro areas as large as Saskatoon or London, Ont.

Lethbridge, Alta., resident Doug Grisack is concerned he'll lose access to programming as a result of Shaw's request, unless he opens up his wallet for pay television service.

""Unless I'm willing to give up some of the rent money, I have to accept that I will no longer be able to receive, as a Canadian, CBC programming,"" said Grisack, who has sent his concerns to the CRTC.

""I think as a Canadian taxpayer, I should have some sort of access to the national programming of the CBC.""

Service a condition of Shaw acquiring Global

Providing the free satellite service was part of a deal Shaw made with the broadcast regulator when it acquired Global TV in 2010. The CRTC required Shaw Direct (then branded Star Choice) to offer the program until its next licence renewal at the end of August 2019.

Shaw's satellite arm looks to end free distribution of satellite to more than 30,000 households. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)

In filing for that licence renewal, Shaw indicated it provided equipment and satellite service to more than 31,000 households, and while it refused to confirm for the CBC how many Canadians are currently receiving signals, it said it voluntarily kept the program going for two years longer than the CRTC originally requested.

In a statement emailed to CBC News, Shaw said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment on the LTSS while their application is in front of the CRTC.

Chunks of Canada lose access to basic, free TV

Large portions of Canada will no longer have access to basic services such as CBC Television signals if this goes through, according to Gregory Taylor, a University of Calgary assistant professor.

""You've got these dead zones as far as over-the-air television goes right now,"" said Taylor, an expert in Canada's conversion from analog to digital television.

He is not advocating that the CRTC require Shaw itself to continue the LTSS, but believes it's important the federal regulator maintain basic TV access across the country.

Small cities like Kingston, Ont., Brandon, Man., Fort McMurray, Alta., and Kelowna, B.C., would be affected.

Gregory Taylor, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, says the CRTC can 'be creative' to maintain the LTSS. (CBC)

""The success of this program should show the CRTC that this demand exists,"" said Taylor. ""The CRTC can be creative about this if they choose to make the effort to maintain it.""

Taylor pointed out the regulator has multiple sources of funding it can direct towards a program like the LTSS, similar to how the CRTC requires funding of Canadian television programming already.

Former chairman surprised by request

The past chairman of the CRTC from 2007-2012 told CBC News he was surprised to hear of Shaw requesting to kill the LTSS service.

""I don't understand why they would not [continue],"" said Konrad von Finkenstein, who oversaw the regulator during the analog to digital transition for broadcast signals, and pointed out the LTSS service gave Shaw free advertising and access to potential customer homes across the country.

Konrad von Finckenstein was chairman of the CRTC when Shaw's free satellite service was first implemented. ((Pawel Dwulit/Canadian Press))

""The whole idea of broadcasting over-the-air is to give people free access to television,"" said von Finkenstein. ""Just because we made a change in assigning the airwaves [converting to digital] it should not come at the expense of people who were enjoying free TV … before.""

Shaw has sent advertisements to current LTSS clients offering them a two-year discount on paid service, but according to customers including Grisack, the company has not indicated what would happen if the CRTC refuses their request to discontinue the program.

The CRTC is accepting public comments on Shaw's application until end of today (May 13). Shaw said it would make its final submission to the regulator later in the month."

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/kenneth-harrisson-not-guilty-1.5146259,Because you don't understand progressives. Consentual relationships are between adults.,15.0,84.0,"A St. John's man accused of possessing child pornography in an unusual case involving what's been described as a child sex doll has been found not guilty.

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

and? what does a scarf around someone's head have to do with this? 

\&gt; In a society that values equality and reason over brainwashing, women should not need to cover their hair, nor their faces, to prove some notion of modesty or piety and shame on anyone who exposes children to this.

i'll cover my hair if I want to or wear it out if I want to. Why should government have any role in my closet?",-1.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/walk-for-water-winnipeg-1.5131285,He is right and you really are.,12.0,109.0,"Over a thousand people poured into the streets of downtown Winnipeg Friday to bring attention to the dozens of First Nations across Canada currently under boil water advisories.

Roughly 1,100 people, including more than 800 students from the Seven Oaks School Division, took part, organizers estimate.

Carrying signs, the demonstrators walked from city hall down Main Street to Portage Avenue, and then up Memorial Boulevard, before ending at the Manitoba Legislative Building.

Eric Jasysyn helped organize the walk and hoped to get the attention of politicians.

""The Indigenous communities have been suffering for so long and it's time to start seeing change,"" said Jasysyn, a Grade 12 student from Seven Oaks Met School.

""We want to make sure everyone understands that water is a basic human right and everyone deserves access to clean water.""

Jasysyn points specifically to the situation at Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, which provides Winnipeg with its drinking water, yet doesn't have a water treatment facility and has been under a years-long boil water advisory.

""It is time to start seeing change and it's time to start getting them the water that they deserve,"" he said.

""We want to start getting people hearing our voices.""

According to Indigenous Services Canada, 57 First Nations across Canada were under long-term drinking water advisories, including four in Manitoba, as of April 27.

Indigenous Services Canada has set a date of March 2021 to have all long-term water advisories lifted on Canadian First Nations, and says 85 of the advisories have been lifted since November 2015.

""There are communities across Canada that don't have access to clean drinking water — that's a big problem.""

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says a gun smuggling 'pipeline' moves firearms across the border from the U.S. into Canada illegally. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Wes Winkel, is the owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to pick out a possible straw buyer, and law enforcement authorities have been slow to identify them based on sales records. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

The Chinese tech executive at the centre of a high-profile international extradition case is seeking to have her case thrown out.

Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer for Chinese telecom giant Huawei, told the the B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver Wednesday that she is the subject of an abuse of process by border officials, RCMP, the FBI and the government of Canada.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.

WATCH: Huawei Canada spokesperson details problems with case

She stands accused of violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran by allegedly misrepresenting Huawei’s ownership and control of Skycom, a company doing business in the Middle Eastern country.

Speaking outside the court, Huawei Canada’s vice-president of media affairs Benjamin Howes said the application to toss the case was based on three key arguments.

Howes said Meng had not actually broken sanctions against Iran, as alleged by U.S. authorities, and had been clear and above board about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom.

He further argued that Meng had been the subject of “serious and repeated violations” of her charter rights at the direction of the FBI and at the hands of Canadian authorities.

“The RCMP intentionally delayed the presentation of the arrest warrant in order to carry out the unlawful detention and search against Ms. Meng,” Howes said.

“This was done under the pretense of a routine border check.”

Meng’s legal team will further argue the sanctions on financial services she is accused of violating are not imposed in Canada, meaning the case does not meet the “double criminality” requirement of Canada’s extradition agreement with the U.S., and is therefore not lawful, Howes said.

In court, Meng’s lawyer Scott Fenton also argued that comments by U.S. President Donald Trump prove the case is politically motivated.

The U.S. and China have tried to keep Meng’s case separate from their trade dispute, although Trump has said he would consider intervening in the case if it would help forge a trade deal with Beijing.

Fenton called Trump’s comments “intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law.”

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

why lie?",-1.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

The Mounties released a statement last week defending their handling of the case and — as late as Monday — had turned aside further requests for comment."

That's not how downgrades work. You're downgraded when credit agencies begin doubting your ability to pay back your debt.

&gt; Sure, the province had debt but we weren't having problems paying it.

Interest on the debt rose to 11.97 billion, representing 8.0% of Ontario's revenue and its fourth-largest spending area. 

You must be the only person who's fine with pissing that much money down the drain.

https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/06/15/ontario-credit-rating-fitch_a_23460172/",7.0,24.0,"Still years away from an election, Mayor John Tory was knocking on doors in midtown Toronto on Saturday morning, freshly printed campaign literature in hand.

But the name on the cards he placed in the hands of residents and slide into the cracks of door frames is not his, it is that of Progressive Conservative MPP Robin Martin. The goal of this campaign is to save Toronto from the senseless and dangerous budget cuts imposed by the province.

In an unprecedented move, Tory went door-to-door to encourage residents to fight back.

This is not a one-off photo opportunity, the mayor said as the canvas began in the pouring rain.

“We’re going to be doing this for as long as we have to in different parts of the city.”

Face time with residents is the latest effort in the city’s clash with the province that has included back-and-forth letters, a war of words via TV news, public statements with other municipal leaders and recently a city-issued petition.

Senior officials say the city faces $177 million in provincial cuts for programs affecting child care, public health and more.

Tory, who was joined by local Councillor Mike Colle and about 25 volunteers and members of his own staff, met residents in Lytton Park, near Avenue Rd. and Glencairn Ave., with a purposely positive message. Saying Martin was a “good person,” Tory asked residents to call or write their provincial representative to encourage her to help reverse the cuts.

“We’re not here to sort of attack anybody,” Tory told those gathered to knock on doors.

Later he told reporters in reference to the MPPs in Toronto ridings: “A lot of these people were very narrowly elected the last time and I hope that they’ll be mindful not only of their own political position but also of the rights and wrongs of this.”

In the pocket of Eglinton-Lawrence that Tory visited Saturday, he had residents’ support.

“I told him I’m very grateful and, you know, my family’s very grateful for having an articulate spokesperson for the city and all the things the city stands for,” said Glenn Miller, who didn’t vote for the PC candidate in the last provincial election and isn’t likely to in the future. “There’s so many threads in the city that need sustaining, quite literally, that we don’t want to see them unilaterally cut.”

Kelly Monaghan had heard about the cuts before Tory arrived at her home and had planned to contact her MPP, Martin.

“I was very disappointed, as the mayor just indicated, that it was done sort of after the budgets had been set ,” she said. “It doesn’t make any sense to me in terms of how to govern, in terms of how to appropriately allocate the resources.”

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

He is not eligible for parole for 50 years, as those ineligibility periods are to be served consecutively in this case, as the judge has decided that's just under s 745.51",2.0,19.0,"""Callous"" killer Edward Downey, who murdered a five-year-old girl and her mother, has been sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole for 50 years.

In December, a jury convicted Edward Downey of first-degree murder in the deaths of Sara Baillie and her daughter, Taliyah Marsman, 5, who were killed on July 11, 2016.

Downey, 49, will be 96 years old when he can apply for release from prison.

""The gravity of the offence, Mr. Downey's moral blameworthiness and his degree of responsibility are at the highest level. After kidnapping Taliyah, Mr. Downey planned and deliberated upon her murder for some hours before he killed her,"" wrote Court of Queen's Bench Justice Beth Hughes in her decision.

Both victims died by asphyxiation. Baillie was found wrapped in duct tape and stuffed inside a laundry hamper. Her daughter's body was found days later, in a rural area east of the city.

'Just about out the door'

Baillie had witnessed Downey abuse her best friend, a woman who can only be identified as AB.

Downey blamed Baillie for encouraging his girlfriend — the victim's best friend — to break up with him. This would have meant Downey, who was broke, would soon be homeless as well.

On the morning of July 11, 2016, ""Ms. Baillie was just about out the door to take Taliyah to daycare when Mr. Downey arrived,"" wrote Hughes.

Downey wrapped duct tape around Baillie's face, hands and wrists, smothering and then strangling her before stuffing her body in a hamper. He then took Taliyah for several hours before deciding to kill the child as well.

After he killed his victims and while he was in the middle of dumping the child, Downey was exchanging flirtatious text messages with a woman.

Those messages show Downey felt no remorse, according to the judge.

Taliyah 'the sole witness'

Though he had hours to change his mind, Downey murdered Taliyah because she would have been able to identify him as her mother's killer.

""By murdering Taliyah, Mr. Downey killed the sole witness to her mother's murder. His text conversations after dumping Taliyah's body outside of the city reveal a callous and remorseless individual,"" wrote Hughes.

Before handing down her sentence on Tuesday, Hughes rejected Downey's bid for a mistrial.

Defence lawyer Gavin Wolch had argued for a judicial review based on the discovery of one juror's political connections which could have been in contravention of the Jury Act which prohibits certain people from serving based on political employment.

Baillie's uncle Scott Hamilton spoke outside the courtroom after the sentence was handed down, thanking police, prosecutors Carla MacPhail and Ryan Jenkins and the judge."

Thats been clear for many replies now, but that’s because youre not willing to listen to any point that isn’t your farcical misrepresentation.

&gt; Got it so you haven't talked to Muslim women in Canada who were born in Canada or immigrated when young. This is just alarmist talk

Forgetting the fact that second generation muslim immigrants tend to be more conservative than their parents and tend to hold more extreme and radical beliefs regarding justified violence in their home land and here?",1.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Djemila Benhabib, representing the Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité, said Tuesday that some Muslim women who wear the hijab are 'fundamentalists.' (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

Sources who spoke to CBC News on condition they remain anonymous said the two former cabinet ministers spoke with Green Party Leader Elizabeth May several times about possibly running for her party.

Wilson-Raybould also attended May's wedding in Victoria at the end of April, stoking rumours that she might jump to the Greens.

Wilson-Raybould currently sits as an independent MP for Vancouver Granvillle and Philpott for Markham-Stouffville.

The two women quit the Liberal cabinet over the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair — which went public early in the year after Wilson-Raybould accused senior officials in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government of pressuring her inappropriately to allow the Quebec-based engineering firm to avoid a trial on corruption charges. They were subsequently kicked out of the Liberal caucus on April 2.

Getting two high-profile ex-Liberals to run for the Greens — especially ones so closely tied to the biggest political scandal to face the Trudeau government — would have given May extra horsepower heading into this election season.

The Greens have been surging recently. On Monday, May will officially welcome the party's second MP into the House of Commons. Paul Manly will be sworn in after winning the recent Nanaimo-Ladysmith byelection in British Columbia by a comfortable margin.

The Greens also have seen an uptick in support in recent provincial elections. In P.E.I., the party took over as the Official Opposition after winning eight seats in April. Ontario voted in its first Green MPP this year. And in 2017, the party won three seats in B.C., giving it the balance of power in the province.

It isn't clear yet if Wilson-Raybould or Philpott will run as independents. Historically, about one-third of Canadian MPs have successfully been re-elected as independents after leaving their parties."

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Lawyer Bob Buckingham, right, represented Harrisson at the trial in St. John's. (Mark Quinn/ CBC)

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

&gt;The book, however, is less successful when it comes to presenting a current understanding of forest and fire ecology. In Firestorm's well-founded eagerness to raise readers’ level of alarm regarding climate change, it unfortunately relies frequently on the common popular approach of demonizing disturbance processes such as fire and native insects. In doing so, the book misses an opportunity to ecologically contextualize and convey much of what current science has to tell us about the habitat created by these processes.

&gt;Rather than recognizing the habitat diversity that comes from multiple successional pathways and the ecological value of different successional rates (Donato et al. 2012, Owen et al. 2017), the book instead tends to assume that such occurrences are examples of damage or loss. Repeated references in the book to wildland fires as “carbon bombs” are not supported by sources and are not tempered by references to scientific research indicating that surprisingly little forest carbon is actually consumed in wildland fires

&gt;With regard to human health impacts, Firestorm suggests that the deaths of a few hundred thousand people each year might be attributable to wildfire smoke but fails to note that, according to the primary source of this estimate, these occurrences are overwhelmingly in tropical regions where unnatural anthropogenic burning of rainforests, typically associated with logging and other development, occurs on a massive scale during all seasons, for multiple years (Johnston et al. 2012). This is unlike the relatively brief pulses of smoke during fire season in fire-adapted vegetation communities.

&gt;Similarly, Firestorm discusses postfire erosion and sedimentation and impacts on downstream municipal water supplies regarding the Hayman fire of 2002 in Colorado, the Lost Creek fire of 2003 in Alberta, and the Rim fire of 2013 in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. However, the book does not examine the role that extensive postfire logging played in chronic sedimentation in these and other fires (e.g., Wagenbrenner et al. 2015)

&gt;the book then relates an anecdotal account from one researcher suggesting that 45 spotted owl territories were lost in the King fire of 2014 in the Sierra Nevada mountains and that there are “no signs of the owls coming back.” The published study from this same researcher reported that only 16 spotted owl territories—not 45—were lost in the King fire (Jones et al. 2016). Subsequently, the US Forest Service spotted-owl survey data revealed that many of those territories had lost occupancy in the years prior to the fire in an area with extensive logging and clearcutting

&gt;In dozens of locations throughout the book, Firestorm states that wildland fires are burning bigger, hotter, and faster but fails to provide scientific citations and does not inform readers about the important nuances of current forest and fire ecology science in the era of climate change. In one passage, a source is provided for the statement that the severity of fires in Alaska is now the highest that it has been in the past 10,000 years, but the cited study pertains only to one localized area of Alaska and concludes that higher levels of fire, determined by charcoal deposits, occurred several hundred years ago in the study area, during the “Medieval Climate Anomaly”

&gt;Firestorm misses the opportunity to educate readers about the fact that North American forests generally remain in a fire deficit currently, relative to natural fire levels that occurred prior to fire-suppression policies, as well as the seemingly counterintuitive fact that despite increasing temperatures and longer fire seasons, fire severity is not increasing currently in the great majority of forests (DellaSala and Hanson 2015, Keyser and Westerling 2017). The presence or absence of such content has the potential to fundamentally influence the way the reader views natural disturbance processes in our forests, as well as forest management responses.


&gt;Overall, the book relies too much on selective and sometimes inaccurate assertions that elicit fear rather than presenting a more complex, and likely more hopeful, narrative informed by a broader summary of current science.",1.0,9.0,"Read Story Transcript

Springtime has become synonymous with wildfire season in many parts of Canada, and it's time the preparation and damage control reflected this, says Ed Struzik.

Our changing climate is directly impacting the frequency and intensity of wildfires, and it's important that Canada's approach to combating these blazes — and their resulting weather systems — is re-visited, he told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

""Our traditional response to wildfire is not going to be good enough in the future,"" the author of Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future said.

Struzik, who is also a fellow at the Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy at Queen's University, spoke with Tremonti about the devastating wildfire south of High Level, Alta., that has led to the evacuation of about 5,000 people, and what the future of wildfires looks like.

Here is part of their conversation.

Residents in High Level, Alta., are preparing to leave their homes following an evacuation alert. (Deb Stecyk)

What worries you about what's going on around High Level right now?

Well this is not the new normal, but it's the new reality. We saw it in B.C. in the last two years, and Alberta the year before, Waterton National Park. Ontario got hit hard last year.

I think this is what we're going to be seeing more of every summer.

And as the fires burn bigger and hotter we're also seeing a real change in weather systems. There's something called the firenado. What do you know about that?

Ed Struzik is an environmental writer and photographer. (Ed Struzik/Twitter)

What we're seeing now is these pyroCbs [pyrocumulonimbus clouds], these fire-driven thunderstorms on the landscape. There was an astonishing four that occurred in 2017 in B.C., and one simultaneously in neighbouring Washington. And I was talking to people from the U.S. naval defence lab in Washington, D.C., who've been watching this along with people from NASA and other people from around the world, and they were just stunned to see that kind of fire-weather activity

It happened not only in B.C. It happened in Texas last year. It's happened in Portugal. It's happened in South America and South Africa. We're starting to see these major, major weather events, fire-weather events, spreading around the world. And that is throwing everybody for a loop. That's spinning heads.

So there've been forest fires before but why do they create a weather system like that with lightning storms?

They're just so hot that they just suck up all of the moisture, and it's essentially like a classic thunderstorm that you have when it gets very hot and humid and it sucks up all the moisture and the heat and then raises it up, creates these pyrocumulus clouds, except there's a lot of carbon and dirty material that it's sucking up from the ground that's been burning. And so they sometimes call that the 'dirty thunderstorm' but it can also create lightning.

Dramatic video from southern California shows a fiery tornado — or ""firenado"" — swirling on the scorched countryside near the community of Phelan in August, 2016. Swirling column of flame moves slowly towards highway 1:02

For example in 2016 we saw one of these pyroCb events ignite a cluster of fire more than 30 kilometres away from the fire's front. And how do you deal with that if you're a firefighter? I mean it's kind of like a Game of Thrones. You don't know where the dragon is going to be exhaling next. And I think that's what we have to start dealing with. This is the new reality, and our traditional response to wildfire is not going to be good enough in the future.

https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2019/05/10/beer-store-union-launches-ad-blitz-attacking-premier-doug-ford-for-threatening-7000-jobs.html,as opposed to the countless amount of jobs that could have been generated if it didn't exist and competition was being promoted within this industry,2.0,70.0,"Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

You'd be hard pressed to find a rental property with proper charging infrastructure.",2.0,51.0,"The cars pass almost silently, but you see hundreds of them on the streets. Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Slim selection

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-arctic-council-1.5127627?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar,You do understand the first settlers didn't arrive till the 17th century right? That's not even 500 years ago let alone 600,8.0,24.0,"The Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), an organization that represents 165,000 Inuit in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka, Russia, blasted the U.S. for torpedoing the Rovaniemi Declaration at Tuesday's Arctic Council ministerial after refusing to sign on if the words ""climate change"" were included in the joint document.

Dalee Sambo Dorough, international chair of the ICC, which is one of the six Arctic Indigenous organizations, known as permanent participants, that make up the Arctic Council along with the eight northern countries, called the U.S. actions a lack of leadership and a ""moral failure.""

""This is the first time the Arctic Council has failed to issue a declaration at the end of a two-year chairmanship, and it's a serious blow to the future of what is supposed to be a consensus-based body,"" Sambo Dorough said in a statement issued late Tuesday.

""Inuit are feeling the effects of climate change every day. While the U.S. government concerns itself with semantics, playing games with words, our people are witnessing the adverse impacts of climate change. What about us and our reality?""

Liubov Taian, the president of ICC Russia, said the reality of Arctic Inuit communities is being ignored.

""This is not just a question of words – it's about the long-term survival of our culture and communities,"" Taian said. ""Our traditional Inuit territory covers 40 per cent of the Arctic region and it is essential that governments work with us to deal with the threat of climate change throughout Inuit Nunaat, our Arctic homeland.""

Scramble for last minute compromise

The Arctic Council's mandate is to discuss sustainable development and environmental protection in the North. The countries' ministers and permanent participants meet biennially at the ministerial to take stock, transfer the rotating two-year chairmanship between the countries, and to sign a declaration that establishes their priorities for the next two years.

This year's ministerial was held in Rovaniemi, Finland, on Tuesday, where Finland handed the two-year rotating chairmanship of the organization over to Iceland.

But it was the first time in the Arctic Council's history that an agreement on the final declaration couldn't be reached.

Instead, the outgoing chair scrambled to cobble together a last-minute compromise with the Arctic states, and issued a one-page statement that pledged a joint commitment to the ""well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic, to sustainable development and to the protection of the Arctic environment,"" but that made no mention of climate change or the Paris climate agreement.

Indigenous voices sidelined

Unlike the usual declarations, which are developed with input from the Arctic Council's Indigenous organizations, the compromise joint ministerial statement was put together without them.

""We are worried about the undermining of the Arctic Council's credibility at a time when genuine leadership and a strong Arctic voice is needed,"" said Hjalmar Dahl, president of ICC Greenland.

Canada's ICC president Monica Ell-Kanayuk said U.S. actions reversed their own commitments made during their recent 2015-17 chairmanship.

""This position was taken by the U.S. administration despite the fact that the 2017 Fairbanks Declaration at the end of the U.S. chairmanship clearly cited the effects of climate change in the Arctic and 'the need for action at all levels,'"" she said.

The U.S. has been at odds with the rest of the Arctic community over climate issues since President Donald Trump announced his country's withdrawal from the Paris climate deal in 2017, a move blasted by other Arctic Council member states and something that continues to be a sticking point in bilateral meetings with Arctic Council nations.

James Stotts, ICC's Alaska president, said sidelining Indigenous contributions and views was a dangerous precedent for the Arctic Council, a forum that has long prided itself for including Arctic Indigenous groups since its founding.

""It's time to seriously listen to the solutions offered by ICC and the other permanent participants,"" he said. ""Its Inuit leadership expressed the unanimous view that given the challenges facing the region, now is the time for a unified response to the threat posed by climate change and its compounding spin-off effects.

""This unity is important for Inuit and all people of the Arctic, as well as the rest of the world."""

Who knows",9.0,37.0,"Eight months after he bolted from the Conservative Party and with the clock ticking to the October general election, the buzz that attended Maxime Bernier’s stormy departure from Andrew Scheer’s caucus to create a rival conservative party has dissipated.

Bernier has so far failed to parlay the significant political capital he had accumulated as a CPC leadership front-runner into a lasting electoral down payment for his People’s Party. If anything, he has depleted that capital.

Two years ago, one in two Conservative members supported Bernier’s bid to succeed Stephen Harper. For 12 of the 13 ballots it took to declare a winner, the leadership was his to lose.

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Maxime Bernier fails to gain momentum in Conservative territory

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

Since Bernier set out on his own last summer, Scheer’s Conservatives have vaulted to first place in voting intentions. Over the first quarter of this year, they raised more money than the ruling Liberals. Over the same period, Scheer’s personal ratings have improved while Bernier’s star has faded.

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

In a recent application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Shaw's home satellite service advised the broadcast regulator it wanted to terminate the Local Television Satellite Solution (LTSS).

The LTSS provided minimum access to Canadian television services, including CBC, Radio-Canada, CTV, Global and Citytv. It was only available free if a household was in an area that previously received over-the-air signals free through an antenna, and lost them in 2011 when transmission converted to digital.

Unless I'm willing to give up some of the rent money, I have to accept that I will no longer be able to receive, as a Canadian, CBC programming. - Doug Grisack, LTSS subscriber in Lethbridge, Alta.

That conversion removed television service for rural Canadians across the country and viewers in both small cities and metro areas as large as Saskatoon or London, Ont.

Lethbridge, Alta., resident Doug Grisack is concerned he'll lose access to programming as a result of Shaw's request, unless he opens up his wallet for pay television service.

""Unless I'm willing to give up some of the rent money, I have to accept that I will no longer be able to receive, as a Canadian, CBC programming,"" said Grisack, who has sent his concerns to the CRTC.

""I think as a Canadian taxpayer, I should have some sort of access to the national programming of the CBC.""

Service a condition of Shaw acquiring Global

Providing the free satellite service was part of a deal Shaw made with the broadcast regulator when it acquired Global TV in 2010. The CRTC required Shaw Direct (then branded Star Choice) to offer the program until its next licence renewal at the end of August 2019.

In filing for that licence renewal, Shaw indicated it provided equipment and satellite service to more than 31,000 households, and while it refused to confirm for the CBC how many Canadians are currently receiving signals, it said it voluntarily kept the program going for two years longer than the CRTC originally requested.

In a statement emailed to CBC News, Shaw said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment on the LTSS while their application is in front of the CRTC.

Chunks of Canada lose access to basic, free TV

Large portions of Canada will no longer have access to basic services such as CBC Television signals if this goes through, according to Gregory Taylor, a University of Calgary assistant professor.

""You've got these dead zones as far as over-the-air television goes right now,"" said Taylor, an expert in Canada's conversion from analog to digital television.

He is not advocating that the CRTC require Shaw itself to continue the LTSS, but believes it's important the federal regulator maintain basic TV access across the country.

Small cities like Kingston, Ont., Brandon, Man., Fort McMurray, Alta., and Kelowna, B.C., would be affected.

Gregory Taylor, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, says the CRTC can 'be creative' to maintain the LTSS. (CBC)

""The success of this program should show the CRTC that this demand exists,"" said Taylor. ""The CRTC can be creative about this if they choose to make the effort to maintain it.""

Taylor pointed out the regulator has multiple sources of funding it can direct towards a program like the LTSS, similar to how the CRTC requires funding of Canadian television programming already.

Former chairman surprised by request

The past chairman of the CRTC from 2007-2012 told CBC News he was surprised to hear of Shaw requesting to kill the LTSS service.

""I don't understand why they would not [continue],"" said Konrad von Finkenstein, who oversaw the regulator during the analog to digital transition for broadcast signals, and pointed out the LTSS service gave Shaw free advertising and access to potential customer homes across the country.

Konrad von Finckenstein was chairman of the CRTC when Shaw's free satellite service was first implemented. ((Pawel Dwulit/Canadian Press))

""The whole idea of broadcasting over-the-air is to give people free access to television,"" said von Finkenstein. ""Just because we made a change in assigning the airwaves [converting to digital] it should not come at the expense of people who were enjoying free TV … before.""

Shaw has sent advertisements to current LTSS clients offering them a two-year discount on paid service, but according to customers including Grisack, the company has not indicated what would happen if the CRTC refuses their request to discontinue the program.

The CRTC is accepting public comments on Shaw's application until end of today (May 13). Shaw said it would make its final submission to the regulator later in the month."

Collin Gallant, a reporter at the Medicine Hat News, said Wednesday in an interview with the Calgary Eyeopener that the plant wasn't a bad idea gone wrong, but rather a victim of persistently low natural gas prices.

""Back when this was thought up as an energy savings program, natural gas was about seven times more expensive than it is today,"" Gallant said.

The plant cost approximately $12 million, with half of that coming from the City of Medicine Hat, and $3 million from both the province and federal government.

Even back then, Clugston acknowledged that the plant made no financial sense because it produced only one megawatt of electricity on an ideal summer day, and the city was not as flush with cash in 2014 when it opened as in 2009 when it launched the project.

Technology common in southern U.S.

The technology that the plant utilized is commonly used in the southern United States. According to Gallant, Medicine Hat's city council tapped into a federal innovation fund in 2008 with a pitch to locate a solar thermal power plant in one of Canada's sunniest cities (2,544 sunshine hours and 330 sunny days a year, according to the City of Medicine Hat website).

As the northernmost CST plant, Medicine Hat's facility provided Alberta Innovates with a significant sample size of data — the deal was that it would provide five years' worth — said Cal Lenz, Medicine Hat's commissioner of energy and utilities, in a release.

""Medicine Hat took a bold step with the project, coming up with the idea at a time when gas prices were extremely high,"" said Lenz. ""Innovation takes valiant moves, and this project is certainly an example of the city's leadership as we continually explore energy solutions.""

The city didn't announce any plans for the plant, other than to say that council would be presented with options in the fall.

Gallant said the plan might be to keep it shut down but intact, in case gas prices escalate, thus making CST-generated energy economical again.

Mothballs

""It's been built, it works, but the decision right now in Medicine Hat is just to mothball it until natural gas prices go up again,"" Gallant said.

The challenge is that natural gas prices have remained stubbornly low and there's no timetable that sees them rising to a level that would make operating the plant economically feasible in the near term, he added.

""I think they said that at the size it is now it would take gas costs of about $19 or … $20 a gigajoule to to make it economical again,"" Gallant said.

Maintaining the plant without running it presents challenges, as well.

""There's some costs in keeping it clean,"" he said. ""There are very large mirrors involved. There's maintenance — it is a pressure system and extreme pressure system so it has to be recertified every now and then.

""The idea is that they're going to mothball it, although I've heard tell they're looking for options for it — there's private industry that might need heat, [and] it does produce a lot of heat.""

The project, Gallant added, is one of a number of sustainability-oriented projects initiated by Medicine Hat.

""The City of Medicine Hat has a fairly forward thinking about renewable energy. We've had a solar home subsidy grant here for about 10 years,"" he said, also noting wind purchase contracts, home turbines and other renewable projects.

""We're 'The Gas City,' but that allowed us to do some interesting things here.""

While the project cost Medicine Hat more than the original plan (which was targeted at $9-10 million), and was already uneconomical by the time it opened in 2014, Lenz said it's no sustainability flop.

""Innovation may not always lead to commercialization, but it does provide valuable information for further endeavours. These learnings will help advance the next evolution of cost-effective, energy-saving initiatives,"" said Lenz in a news release.

""The provincial and federal governments chose our city to lead the project and foster learning about this technology, and this objective has been successfully achieved.""

 You don't have the right to take my scarf and coat off.",-1.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

Used fuel from the Bruce Power plant is stored in the form of pellets that fit into tubes. These tubes are collected into bundles and packed into carbon steel tubes coated in copper. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository. If so, it seems like one more question may arise in the years ahead: does it really makes sense to build two?"
https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/2019/05/22/so-far-maxime-bernier-poses-little-threat-to-andrew-scheer.html,I think the biggest threat to Andrew Scheer is Andrew Scheer.,11.0,37.0,"Eight months after he bolted from the Conservative Party and with the clock ticking to the October general election, the buzz that attended Maxime Bernier’s stormy departure from Andrew Scheer’s caucus to create a rival conservative party has dissipated.

Bernier has so far failed to parlay the significant political capital he had accumulated as a CPC leadership front-runner into a lasting electoral down payment for his People’s Party. If anything, he has depleted that capital.

Two years ago, one in two Conservative members supported Bernier’s bid to succeed Stephen Harper. For 12 of the 13 ballots it took to declare a winner, the leadership was his to lose.

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Maxime Bernier fails to gain momentum in Conservative territory

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

Since Bernier set out on his own last summer, Scheer’s Conservatives have vaulted to first place in voting intentions. Over the first quarter of this year, they raised more money than the ruling Liberals. Over the same period, Scheer’s personal ratings have improved while Bernier’s star has faded.

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

The letter — served on behalf of the Foothills School Division — was written by Brownlee LLP, a large Edmonton law firm, and penned two days after CBC's original story was published.

""It's an example of trying to squash a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Gillian Colborne, one of the mothers who spoke to CBC News after pulling her son from the class over concerns he was struggling in a large room with 47 kids and two teachers.

Colborne, who has another child attending the school, says parents have been trying to get answers from the school division for months, and she was surprised to receive the three-page cease-and-desist letter.

Other parents have also received the letter and are not willing to be interviewed as a result.

""We are parents attempting to advocate for our children in a very calm open manner,"" said Colborne. ""It just seems unnecessary. I would have expected somebody to come to us and say, 'Oh, these are real and valid concerns you have. Let's sit down and talk about them.'""

Parents could be banned from school

The letter accuses parents of making false allegations in communications to various parties. It claims they've made defamatory comments, filed malicious complaints and says that they could be banned from the school. It also threatens legal action if they don't refrain from repeating or publishing their comments.

""Your advocacy has exceeded the boundaries of productive dialogue and devolved into disparaging the professional reputation of well-respected educators,"" the letter states.

It goes on to say the Foothills School Division has responded to each concern relating to their children. It accuses the parents of repeatedly pressuring school staff members through text messages, emails — as well as in person — and says several staff members claim they felt ""unduly pressured by your relentless tactics.""

""To be clear, you are to cease sending all e-mail or other correspondence that contains false or defamatory comments regarding any Foothills School Division employee to anyone. Any failure on your part to take heed of this warning may result in legal proceedings.""

The Foothills School division declined CBC's request for an interview. In a written statement, a spokesperson says: ""At times actions must be taken to ensure that third parties do not negatively impact a school environment and workplace.""

""We feel that we have fully addressed any questions surrounding the Grade 2 classroom configuration at Red Deer Lake School,"" the email states.

""We maintain that it is an effective learning environment. As we stated previously, all parents are welcome to continue to discuss with their child's teacher(s) and school administration any concerns they have about their child's learning.""

Barbara Silva with Support Our Students Alberta calls the cease-and-desist letters 'heavy-handed.' (CBC)

Letter called 'heavy-handed'

""It seems like a very heavy-handed way to shut this conversation down,"" said Barbara Silva, communications director with Support Our Students Alberta. ""Once you bring in legal counsel, it sets up a David and Goliath dynamic.""

Silva says she believes the parents' concerns about a large combined classroom are ""well-founded"" and exist around the province.

While her organization regularly hears from parents who feel their concerns aren't taken seriously by school divisions, Silva says she's never heard of a division taking this kind of legal step.

""Just the sheer image of a school board putting out cease-and-desist orders is pretty alarming,"" said Silva, who admits she isn't privy to all the communications that have occurred between the parents, the school and the school division.

""It puts parents in a position that either they're not going to come forward with their concerns, or they understand really clearly they're going to need to get legal counsel to do so. And that's going to make sure that a lot of people don't come forward with their concerns.""

Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

READ MORE: Atlantic Canada clean energy collaboration receives $2M federal investment

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

Used fuel from the Bruce Power plant is stored in the form of pellets that fit into tubes. These tubes are collected into bundles and packed into carbon steel tubes coated in copper. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository. If so, it seems like one more question may arise in the years ahead: does it really makes sense to build two?"

What about other industries like solar or wind or hemp or whatever else? Nope, just oil is all we should ever use.",0.0,32.0,"Canada's energy sector saw a big bump in profit in the first quarter this year as rising oil prices helped businesses swing from a loss in the previous quarter, according to the latest federal government data.

Operating profit for companies in oil and gas extraction and support services rose by $1.6 billion in the first three months after a loss of $678 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $909 million, according to Statistics Canada.

""This increase was attributable to a rise in oil prices,"" the report said.

Even though global oil prices have been facing volatility this week — along with the rest of the stock market — on concerns over the impact of the trade war between the United States and China, prices have skyrocketed since the start of the year.

Benchmark U.S. oil — West Texas Intermediate — is up nearly 30 per cent this year to $58.45 US a barrel. It shot up above $60 a barrel in March for the first time in 2019.

Meanwhile, Western Canadian Select oil has jumped more than 45 per cent to over $41 a barrel.

Energy led gains among all industries

The gain in operating profit in the energy sector outpaced all other major Canadian industries in the first quarter.

The manufacturing and real estate sectors were the only other major industries that saw operating profit increase, while it declined for financial, technology, wholesale trade and retail sectors, according to Statistics Canada.

(Statistics Canada)

Even within manufacturing, operating profit for petroleum and coal product manufacturers rose 5.6 per cent ""due to higher oil prices,"" the report said.

But, the government agency also pointed out that inventory levels among oil and gas companies grew in 2018. The Alberta government had introduced mandatory production cuts in December to buoy the price of Canadian oil.

""It seemed that as pipelines and railcars reached their full capacity, producers could not get their crude oil to market and had to put barrels into storage tanks,"" the report said. ""Ultimately, this translated into higher inventories in the balance sheet of Canadian enterprises in the oil and gas extraction and support activities.""

Operating profit down in Canada

Meanwhile, overall operating profit among all Canadian businesses fell 0.3 per cent to $107 billion in the first quarter from the previous one.

The mixed picture for Canadian businesses, varying by sector, is not surprising — considering many economists expect growth in the first quarter to be subdued.

On the lower end of market consensus, Brian DePratto, senior economist at TD Economics, is forecasting that the Canadian economy grew at an annualized quarterly rate of 0.4 per cent in the first three months — the same as in the previous quarter.

""A very weak export performance, measurement differences, and a downgraded picture of construction activity from Statistics Canada all point to quarterly GDP underperforming the monthly indicators,"" he said in a note on Friday.

The first quarter GDP data is scheduled to be released May 31."

Liberals wanted to delay 3 years to allow Irving and another to give bids.  The right thing was done at the time.  Liberals then got into power and decided to throw politics at the issue.",27.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

(The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

More on that next week."

Johan Hofer, 48, admitted to beating children in the Waterton Hutterite Colony and in his class with straps, tree branches — and in one case, burning them with a lighter to show them how hot hell would be.

Judge Derek Redman of the Provincial Court of Alberta imposed a two-year conditional sentence order, meaning Hofer will serve his sentence in the community under conditions that include house arrest for 12 months and a curfew for the remaining year.

Because of the abuse they suffered between 2002 and 2013, several children left the colony at Hill Spring, Alta. — some 70 kilometres southwest from Lethbridge — before their 18th birthdays to get away from Hofer, according to the facts read aloud by the prosecutor.

Dozens of male ministers from Hutterite colonies across the Prairies showed up in court, filling the room.

When asked their opinions on Hofer staying in the community, one elder from Waterton said the case has been ""very, very emotional for the colony and for the church.""

If he causes no arguments, ""it will be for the good to come together as one family to serve our heavenly father,"" said the elder.

Whipped, humiliated

Since the charges were laid, many of the victims' families have been ostracized from the community, according to prosecutor Darwyn Ross.

Hofer was to go on trial this week on 14 counts of assault with a weapon but pleaded to half the counts instead.

The court heard Tuesday what some of the victims endured.

In several cases, Hofer would have children kneel on the hard tile for the duration of his class. Often he would have his victims — who ranged in ages from six to 14 — bend over a stool and would whip them with a leather strap in front of their classmates.

The children described feeling not only intense physical pain but also humiliation.

""Most days I was afraid to leave the house,"" wrote one of Hofer's victims in an impact statement.

The boy, whose identity is protected by a publication ban, said his days always ended in tears and he felt as though he had nowhere to hide.

'Did not intend to hurt the children'

One girl said the pain was often a 10 out of 10 after Hofer hit her hands and backside with a belt, tree branches and yardsticks.

Another victim described being hit in the side with a stick so hard he bled through his shirt. The boy was guilty, in Hofer's opinion, of failing to write out his German verses quickly enough.

Redman asked the lawyers involved if Hofer simply ""went way too far"" in his effort to discipline.

Defence lawyer Adriano Iovinelli agreed with the judge's suggestion.

""My client did not intend to hurt the children,"" said Iovinelli. ""The intent was for the discipline.""

Iovinelli compared his client's actions to old-school corporal punishment, which the senior defence lawyer said even he suffered as a child."

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

Claire Avery, a rugby player at Charles P. Allen High School, said she and her teammates were shocked and devastated by the news.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Brooklyn Peyton, who plays rugby for Lockview High School in Fall River, hoped she would go to university on a rugby scholarship.

She said she's blown away by news of the cancellation.

'I just love the team'

""I started with this team, it's important to me, they are like family,"" she said. ""My coach means a lot to me. He's kind of like my second dad ... I just love the team.""

She and other rugby players at Lockview plan to wear their jerseys to school Friday and play some informal games on the school field to show support for the team.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the group has asked to meet with the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation about the decision to cancel school rugby. (CBC)

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced in his fall economic update that the federal government would make $600 million in tax credits and incentives available to selected media outlets over the next five years.

An independent panel of experts was to be tasked with naming the eligible news organizations and assisting the government in implementing the measures.

""Today, we are reaching another milestone toward the implementation of these tax measures that aim to support Canadian journalism and journalism in under-served communities,"" said Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez.

The eight associations that have been asked to select a representative to sit on the independent panel by the middle of June are: News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

According to a statement released by Rodriguez's office, the panel members will be expected to consult with third parties and industry stakeholders before reporting back to the minister's office by late July.

In his fall update, Morneau announced some details of the $600 million program to help Canada's news media organizations — many of which have been struggling with diminishing revenue and falling readership numbers.

Under the program, news media organizations are eligible for refundable tax credits, a non-refundable tax credit for subscriptions to Canadian digital news and access to charitable tax incentives for not-for-profit journalism.

Rodriguez also named the seven organizations representing different segments of the news media which will be responsible for administering an additional fund of $50 million over five years to help regional media outlets.

The seven local organizations are: News Media Canada, Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspapers Association, National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, Community Radio Fund of Canada, the Canadian Association of Community Television Users and Stations, and the Fédération des télévisions communautaires autonomes du Québec."

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-working-with-harper-1.5128872,"&gt; Everything I'm hearing about this seems to boil down to, ""Harper's favourite shipbuilder was different from the OLP's pick and various fuckery happened as one faction or the other vied for the contract"".

There's more to it than that.  Irving, as well as a Vancouver shipyard (Seaspan) had been awarded all the work from the government's major navy procurement project, with Davie being shut out. So awarding the interim supply ship contract to Irving would just bump the rest of the navy's ships back in the queue.

Also, Davie had already come up with a design and pitched it to the government on their own, before the HMCS Protecteur went down in flames. So Davie was ready and time was of the essence because when the Protecteur became inoperable, Canada had no other supply ships.

So from Norman's point of view, I'm sure his only concern was getting the navy the ship it needed as quickly as possible.  And for the government, having already bypassed Davie in favor of Irving on the major navy contract, I'm not sure the suggestion that Davie was their ""favorite shipyard"" makes sense.  To me it seems like a case where bypassing the usual procurement process due to an emergency seems justified.",7.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

EDIT: Modified out of respect for garbage everywhere with my most sincere apologies.",18.0,16.0,"""Callous"" killer Edward Downey, who murdered a five-year-old girl and her mother, has been sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole for 50 years.

In December, a jury convicted Edward Downey of first-degree murder in the deaths of Sara Baillie and her daughter, Taliyah Marsman, 5, who were killed on July 11, 2016.

Downey, 49, will be 96 years old when he can apply for release from prison.

""The gravity of the offence, Mr. Downey's moral blameworthiness and his degree of responsibility are at the highest level. After kidnapping Taliyah, Mr. Downey planned and deliberated upon her murder for some hours before he killed her,"" wrote Court of Queen's Bench Justice Beth Hughes in her decision.

Both victims died by asphyxiation. Baillie was found wrapped in duct tape and stuffed inside a laundry hamper. Her daughter's body was found days later, in a rural area east of the city.

'Just about out the door'

Baillie had witnessed Downey abuse her best friend, a woman who can only be identified as AB.

Downey blamed Baillie for encouraging his girlfriend — the victim's best friend — to break up with him. This would have meant Downey, who was broke, would soon be homeless as well.

On the morning of July 11, 2016, ""Ms. Baillie was just about out the door to take Taliyah to daycare when Mr. Downey arrived,"" wrote Hughes.

Downey wrapped duct tape around Baillie's face, hands and wrists, smothering and then strangling her before stuffing her body in a hamper. He then took Taliyah for several hours before deciding to kill the child as well.

After he killed his victims and while he was in the middle of dumping the child, Downey was exchanging flirtatious text messages with a woman.

Those messages show Downey felt no remorse, according to the judge.

Taliyah 'the sole witness'

Though he had hours to change his mind, Downey murdered Taliyah because she would have been able to identify him as her mother's killer.

""By murdering Taliyah, Mr. Downey killed the sole witness to her mother's murder. His text conversations after dumping Taliyah's body outside of the city reveal a callous and remorseless individual,"" wrote Hughes.

Before handing down her sentence on Tuesday, Hughes rejected Downey's bid for a mistrial.

I mean, maybe you're relatively young and are new to this - fair enough - but today's recent calls for disaster are really nothing new.",4.0,37.0,"Eight months after he bolted from the Conservative Party and with the clock ticking to the October general election, the buzz that attended Maxime Bernier’s stormy departure from Andrew Scheer’s caucus to create a rival conservative party has dissipated.

Bernier has so far failed to parlay the significant political capital he had accumulated as a CPC leadership front-runner into a lasting electoral down payment for his People’s Party. If anything, he has depleted that capital.

Two years ago, one in two Conservative members supported Bernier’s bid to succeed Stephen Harper. For 12 of the 13 ballots it took to declare a winner, the leadership was his to lose.

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Maxime Bernier fails to gain momentum in Conservative territory

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

Since Bernier set out on his own last summer, Scheer’s Conservatives have vaulted to first place in voting intentions. Over the first quarter of this year, they raised more money than the ruling Liberals. Over the same period, Scheer’s personal ratings have improved while Bernier’s star has faded.

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

Keep going, I'm not done laughing.",0.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

The shooting occurred just after 4 a.m. at a home in Whitchurch-Stouffville, near Bloomington Road and Ninth Line, according to York Regional Police.

The home was rented out on Airbnb, police said. A now-removed post listed the property for $700 per night.

Paramedics responded and pronounced the victim dead on the second floor of the home. Const. Andy Pattenden said that police are still trying to identify him and no further details were immediately available.

At least 60 people fled the area in the aftermath of the shooting, police said. Only the person who had rented the home for the night remained at the scene to speak with officers.

Investigators think there may have been hundreds of people at the party in the hours before the shooting, according to Pattenden.

""We know there were people here. We know there are people who probably heard or saw what happened and we need them to come forward right away,"" he told reporters at the scene.

Homicide detectives have been called in to investigate.

2 males arrested near home

In a news release, police said that around 4:30 a.m., two males were arrested on Bethesda Side Road, several kilometres away from the home, after a caller reported that they had been knocking on doors and asking residents to call them a taxi.

When officers arrived at the scene on Bethesda Side Road, the two males were hiding in bushes. A handgun was found near where they were arrested, police said.

According to Pattenden, homicide investigators are still trying to figure out if there is a link between the shooting and the two males.

""It's still far too early to tell if these two incidents are connected to each other,"" he said.

Both males are minors and appeared in court on Friday for weapons charges, according to police.

Kevin McGuckin lives across the road from where the pair were found by police. He didn't hear anything during the night, but he did get a call from a neighbour asking if the two males had knocked on his door.

""Stouffville is quite a good community and we're proud to live here, but seeing all this it really makes you think that you got to be aware what's going on all the time,"" he told CBC Toronto.

""My heart goes out to the family. Hopefully everything gets solved.""

In an email statement, a spokesperson for Airbnb said that the person who booked the rental has been removed from the site and the listing has been suspended ""as we investigate.

""The safety of our community is our priority, and our thoughts are with the victims of this senseless tragedy. There is no place on Airbnb for such an abhorrent act, which violates everything our Canadian community stands for. We stand ready to work with local law enforcement and support their investigation,"" the spokesperson said.

Anyone with information about the shooting or the party is asked to contact York police.

'Our schools are safe places'

Meanwhile, the York Region District School Board issued a statement Friday night saying it was shocked and horrified to learn of the homicide, while urging people not to speculate, jump to conclusions or make assumptions.

The board said it's supporting the efforts of York Regional Police in their investigation.

""Our focus is on providing support to our students and families,"" director of education Louise Sirisko said in the statement.

""Regardless of the details of the police investigation, we know that some students will be looking for support and reassurances that they are safe.""

Sirisko said the board has developed tips to support families in their conversations with children and youth about tragic events.

Students are set to return to school on Monday, and Sirisko said staff members will be available to provide support.

""If you have concerns about your child's emotional well-being or reaction to the news of this incident, please contact the school so you can work together to provide support.

Some salmon rivers were completely blocked off to catch fish, then when enough were caught, the weirs were removed. We could've done the same to eulachon rivers as well.

The various fish species were in high numbers before industrial fishing techniques existed. 

Also there were fewer impacts to their habitat and they didn't die as bycatch to other fisheries.",1.0,48.0,"Listen to the Renew: Stories of Indigenous Innovation special on CBC Radio Monday, May 20 at noon local time, across the country.

It's been decades since Les Antone has seen an abundance of eulachon line the banks of B.C.'s Fraser River as far as Chilliwack and into the tributaries past Agassiz.

""A lot of our people call it swíw̓ə [swee-wah],"" said Antone, the long-time Kwantlen First Nation fisheries manager and council member.

""It means the silver lining. Because when the eulachon came up by the millions ... they would spawn and die on the beaches creating a silver lining.""

But that was about 30 years ago, he said.

Commercial developments, log booming, river dredging and disturbances, shrimp trawling, and changes in climate are some factors that may have made this staple species for many B.C. Indigenous communities a rarity in the lower Fraser River area.

In 2011, the Fraser River eulachon population was assessed as endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).

""Our legacy we're leaving – we hope is going to be a rosier one than it is now. But reality is the stocks of concern have grown and grown and we're fishing less and less every year.""

Kwantlen community members are now doing their part to ensure the species isn't left behind, and future generations along the Fraser see that silver lining again.

Swíw̓ə: a culturally significant species

Eulachon are a small silver-coloured fish from the smelt family. The oily fish grows to around 20 centimetres, and is also known as candlefish, ooligan, or oolichan. They spawn in freshwater streams and rivers like the Fraser River for a few weeks between April and early May each year.

Among the Stó:lō people, the fish and its oil was used traditionally for food, social, and ceremonial purposes such as burnings held in the winter where they honour loved ones who have died.

""We do cultural burnings, ceremonial memorials in the longhouse, and we give away the smoked eulachon,"" Antone said.

Fern Gabriel (Sesmelot), a Kwantlen storyteller, language and cultural teacher, recalls a time when spring marked the presence of swíw̓ə.

""You could smell them in the air,"" she said.

Kwantlen First Nation storyteller, Hǝn̓q̓ǝmin̓ǝm language and cultural teacher Fern Gabriel keeps the memory of the Fraser River swíw̓ə (eulachon) alive by hosting educational walking tours on Kwantlen territory. (Collins Maina)

She said she was fortunate to live with her mother, an elder, at a time when they could enjoy dinners with about 30 eulachon on the table, and that she gets hungry at the thought of how her mother used to coat them in flour and fry them up.

Since 2014, Gabriel has hosted summer Kwantlen walking tours at her home on McMillan Island, near Fort Langley B.C., which include a traditional lesson about swíw̓ə.

""We are caring for the land. All of us need to be a part of that,"" she said.

'We're in a crisis situation'

Antone said the low numbers each year make it difficult for them to do any yearly planning for fish harvesting.

He said this will be a low brood year. On April 2, the first day they were allowed to fish for eulachon on the Fraser, the two fishermen came back with only a couple dozen.

In the past, fisheries would harvest about 500 kg of eulachon in a day with a single net. The catch now varies between 18 and 70 kg per year – which is then distributed equally between 23 bands located above Port Mann.

Now elders get about five or six of the small-sized fish each year, more of a treat than a staple.

""Our food security is endangered. We're in a crisis situation,"" he said.

Eulachon harvests are a community effort. In previous years with slightly larger catches, several community members came down to the boat launch to help shake down the nets. (Submitted by Les Antone)

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has closed commercial and recreational eulachon fisheries, suspended river dredging during spawning season, and is working toward reducing eulachon bycatch by the commercial shrimp trawls, which Antone said are a big problem.

Because of fishing restrictions, Indigenous communities harvesting the fish for food or ceremonial purposes must apply for communal licences.

Even though there are a few exemptions for ceremonies, Antone said the restrictions take them further away from their traditional lifestyle, where they were freer to fish.

Seyem Qwantlen Business Group's land and resource manager Ashley Doyle said more awareness of the species is needed.

The group ran a larger eulachon recovery project in 2014 to 2015, funded by the Aboriginal Fund for Species at Risk (AFSAR). The project focused on habitat restoration and testing, and gathering traditional knowledge from community fishers.

""[We're] just trying to bring attention to these [fish] because they are such a critical species,"" Doyle said.

""No one knows what they are, so I was just trying to give these little guys a voice.""

They also produced a ""Meet the Fraser River Eulachon"" poster urging people to plant native shrubs and trees next to streams to encourage spawning, contain garbage and avoid using fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.

Combining traditional knowledge with science and data

Kwantlen and several other communities in the Lower Fraser region now work together in the Lower Fraser Fisheries Alliance (LFFA, to advocate and strategize plans for different fish species, prioritizing those at risk, such as eulachon and salish sucker.

Decades ago fishermen were able to fill their buckets in one eulachon run, now Les Antone says they are only able to fill about a quarter to a third of a bucket per run. (Collins Maina)

The LFFA has three staff biologists who work on monitoring, site testing, compliance, and counting the fish. Antone said Kwantlen fishers share their traditional ecological knowledge about spawning grounds to help conservation efforts. They are supporting an eulachon egg counting study at the soon-to-be-replaced Pattullo Bridge in Surrey.

""We try to get studies [done]. Whatever we can [do] to add to our science,"" he said. ""We need the science to back up what we're saying.""

The species is under consideration for designation as endangered under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). DFO staff said the decision will be made in the next two years, and could lead to more protections and possibly more conservation funding. This may also lead to more fishing restrictions.

Antone said he hopes to see the species numbers improve so that the future generations don't have to learn about eulachon only from books.

""Books are great, but if you're out there in a boat with your dad and your uncle or cousin and handling a net and seeing stuff out there, that's just amazing.""

&amp;#x200B;

  
It has nothing to do with skin color. It has everything to do with numbers.",4.0,23.0,"A former Allstate Insurance Canada employee who launched a wrongful dismissal suit and had publicly criticized a practice she called discriminatory is defending herself against an Allstate counterclaim that could cost her more than $700,000 in damages.

The legal battle, which will head to a Toronto court on Thursday, could set a dangerous precedent and discourage private-sector employees from speaking out against their employers, said Andrew Monkhouse, the lawyer representing Mehdi Joshi in a wrongful dismissal suit against Allstate.

If the Allstate lawsuit succeeds, ""people are going to be less willing to go out and comment to the media about concerns and potential inappropriate activity,"" said Monkhouse.

""There's a public interest in having ex-employees be able to talk about what happened at their past work.""

Joshi claims she was fired last year after confronting her managers over a plan to stop selling insurance to drivers who live in Brampton, which has some of the highest premiums in Ontario.

She argued the plan was a thinly veiled attempt to deny auto insurance to the city's large visible-minority population.

""It's just wrong. There is no other word for it,"" she told CBC Toronto in late 2018 after filing the wrongful dismissal suit. The U.S.-based insurance giant has since filed a counterclaim, alleging Joshi caused ""damages to Allstate's reputation and goodwill.""

Joshi and her lawyer are seeking to have the counterclaim dismissed and to proceed with their original wrongful dismissal lawsuit, which is seeking some $600,000 in damages.

""We do hope that if we're successful, it will give a clear message to all employees that if they have concerns of impropriety at their workplace, that they're able to voice those concerns,"" Monkhouse said.

Joshi declined to comment directly to CBC Toronto and Allstate did not respond to multiple interview requests.

Allstate accused of trying to silence critics

Joshi argues Allstate's counterclaim is an attempt to silence her and discourage whistleblowing around the issue of discrimination.

In her latest court submission, Joshi said the company has tried to cause a ""chilling effect"" that would stop her from speaking to the media.

""It is very stressful to have your past employer sue you for so much money for speaking out about concerns you have regarding their practices,"" Joshi writes in the submission.

The submission also claims the company has used similar practices of ""strategic litigation"" to silence other critics, though it does not provide specific examples.

Fewer 'protections' for private-sector workers

According to an employment law expert, Joshi's claim against Allstate will be weaker than typical whistleblowing cases, which usually happen within the public sector.

That's because private-sector employees do not have the same protections as public servants, who are legally protected when speaking out about a wider range of misconduct at their places of work.

""In the private sector, there aren't those protections,"" said Joseph Cohen-Lyons, a Toronto-based employment lawyer.

""An employee is only protected if they're whistleblowing about a criminal action.""

Cohen-Lyons said disgruntled private-sector workers rarely approach him seeking help, in part because those workers may be fearful of losing their jobs due to a lack of whistleblower protections."

Either they require full protective gear like hockey and football or it has no place in schools.,1.0,58.0,"Players, parents and coaches are angry that the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation has decided to cancel public school rugby games across the province because of safety concerns.

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the group has asked to meet with the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation about the decision to cancel school rugby. (CBC)

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."

Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx32b5igLwA",1.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

Canada is just along for the ride.,-3.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

The article is pretty light on the deets.,9.0,27.0,"A federal committee that oversees House of Commons expenses has cleared Alberta Premier Jason Kenney of any wrongdoing for claiming a room in his mother's basement as his primary residence while he sat as a Conservative MP.

House of Commons expenditure reports show Kenney collected secondary-residence subsidies in Ottawa between 2012 and 2015 of about $10,000 each year as an MP for Calgary Midnapore, while his mother's retirement-community bungalow in Calgary was listed as his address with Elections Canada.

Daniel Paquette, the chief financial officer of the House of Commons, said Kenney, whose United Conservative Party won a majority in last month's provincial election, met all the requirements that were necessary at the time of his claims.

'Partisan considerations'

While conservative MPs on the Board of Internal Economy were satisfied with the ruling, they called the process a partisan attack and warned they could dig into historical expense claims, as well.

The Board of Internal Economy is responsible for the financial and administrative affairs of the House of Commons, and sets budgets for MP office spending, hospitality, travel expenses and security.

""I think, quite frankly, this board should be very concerned that this process was engaged for what can only be determined to have been partisan considerations to affect the ability of Mr. Kenney to conduct his campaign to become premier of Alberta,"" said MP Mark Strahl.

""So, quite frankly, I think this was a very disturbing case, because we can all play this game. We can go back to times when members of the Liberal Party were found to have been illegally claiming housing allowances,"" Strahl said.

Conservative MP Candice Bergen echoed her colleague's concerns.

""I think we have to think very, very seriously about what happened and how we were a part of it,"" she said.

The Board of Internal Economy is the governing body of the House of Commons and is responsible for expense policies. It is non-partisan.

Allegations raised before campaign

The allegations that Kenney was improperly claiming expenses was first raised by lawyer Kyle Morrow in January in the lead-up to the Alberta election campaign.

Morrow ran for the Alberta Liberals in the riding of Lacombe-Ponoka in the 2012 provincial election, which prompted the Kenney campaign to dismiss him as a ""failed Liberal candidate.""

The parliamentary investigation was initiated when Ontario Liberal MP Jennifer O'Connell formally requested it.

At the board hearing on Thursday, government house whip Mark Holland said he believes the investigation was important, even though it found no fault.

""I understand the concern. I would just simply state that the process of verifying, particularly when in a public forum and there are questions about expenses, there is an important need to verify the veracity of those expenses sometimes,"" he said.

Holland said he is satisfied with the findings."

Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

WATCH: Proposed ‘ideal’ site for nuclear waste storage in Ontario raises concerns

0:38 Proposed ‘ideal’ site for nuclear waste storage in Ontario raises concerns Proposed ‘ideal’ site for nuclear waste storage in Ontario raises concerns

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository. If so, it seems like one more question may arise in the years ahead: does it really makes sense to build two?"
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/environmental-groups-alberta-energy-jason-kenney-1.5142290,"I mean, we all know they are American oil and gas patsies.",4.0,20.0,"Environmental groups targeted by Alberta Premier Jason Kenney are shrugging off the new government's promised $30-million ""war room"" to fight criticisms of the province's energy industry.

""The war room makes for good theatre, but the people who follow this closely are going to look at this as amateur hour,"" said Keith Stewart of Greenpeace.

""Chasing environmentalists might play well politically, but it's not actually relevant to the discussion that Alberta and Canada need to be having,"" added Simon Dyer of the clean-energy think tank Pembina Institute.

Both groups have been singled out by Kenney as examples of ones distorting the truth about the impact of the oilsands.

The premier has said government staff will be tasked with responding quickly to what he calls myths and lies. Kenney has also promised to fund lawsuits against offending environmentalists and to call a public inquiry into the role of money from U.S. foundations.

""Stay tuned,"" Energy Minister Sonya Savage said Tuesday. ""We'll have something to talk about next week.""

Environmental groups have already been discussing informally what the United Conservative government might have in mind and how they should react.

""We've been contacted,"" said Devon Page of Eco Justice, an environmental law firm. ""We've been saying to the groups, 'We're here. We'll respond and represent you as we have in the past.'

""What we're trying hard not to do is to do what I think the Kenney government wants, which is to get distracted.""

Dyer and Stewart said their groups are about 85 per cent funded by Canadians. The Pembina Institute was founded in Drayton Valley, Alta., and its headquarters remain in Calgary.

A lot of the rhetoric around our work and our contribution to Alberta has been based on complete misinformation. - Simon Dyer, Pembina Institute

Both called the war room political posturing aimed at the party's base.

""A lot of the rhetoric around our work and our contribution to Alberta has been based on complete misinformation,"" said Dyer, who noted Pembina has worked with virtually every major energy company in the province.

Stewart called the threats a rerun of the 2012 campaign against environmental groups fuelled by the right-wing The Rebel media group and led by Stephen Harper's federal Conservatives.

""We learned to play rope-a-dope,"" said Stewart. ""Stephen Harper was our best recruiter.

""We had people contacting us saying 'how do I lie down in front of a bulldozer?' We don't usually get a lot of those calls but we were getting a lot of those calls.""

Each group is confident in the accuracy of the facts it cites. Dyer said Pembina research has been used by investors, academics and governments.

'Not interested in polarizing this debate'

Stewart said the issue isn't facts, but how they are understood.

""Often what it is is a disagreement over which fact is important. Industry will say 'we're reducing emissions per barrel.' We'll say 'emissions are going up.' Both statements are true and it depends which you think is more important.""

Cara Zwibel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the Kenney government must tread carefully. It's okay to defend your position, but not to threaten, she said.

""If we're talking about initiating lawsuits against individuals or organizations on the basis of speaking out on issues of public importance, then that raises serious problems,"" she said. ""Then we have a much more obvious impact and potential violation on freedom of expression.""

It's difficult to see that this sort of general debate they're going to be able to shutdown with defamation law. - Sean Ward, lawyer

The province could possibly expose itself to legal action if its statements harm a group or individual — say, by putting them at the centre of a Twitter firestorm, said an Edmonton lawyer.

""There's certainly some kind of moral responsibility in terms of understanding that kind of highly charged rhetoric,"" said Sean Ward, who practises media law. ""You have to understand the consequences that are likely to follow.""

Ward said any cases the government funds would also be tough to win.

""There are a lot of available defences. It's difficult to see that this sort of general debate they're going to be able to shutdown with defamation law.""

Environmentalists say their response will be to avoid distraction and carry on.

""The vast majority active in this place don't want to go back to a high conflict, polarizing environment,"" Dyer said. ""We're not interested in polarizing this debate."""
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-working-with-harper-1.5128872,The fact is the RCMP never interviewed staffers and the previous government. They made an error. Henein doesn't know what the RCMP did and they started well before the case began. Why trust Henein and not the DPP and RCMP?,-7.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

On Friday, police executed a search warrant at a home on Larratt Lane, near Bathurst Street and Elgin Mills Road West, and discovered explosive materials. Police did not specify what exactly the materials were or how much was removed. They said chemicals were also seized.

Ontario Provincial Police, along with the York police's explosives detection unit, helped to removed the materials.

As a precaution, police practically shut down the street on Friday, forcing neighbours from their homes and restricting vehicle and pedestrian traffic as officers carried out their work. Neighbours have since been allowed back into their homes, police said.

Despite, evacuation orders being lifted and the suburban street returning to normal, residents say they have been left feeling uneasy.

Area resident Rajneesh Bir said crime was so uncommon in the neighbourhood that even minor robberies were rare.

""Suddenly we hear about explosives and wow. It's very scary,"" Bir said.

'It's a very serious case for sure'

Const. Andy Pattenden, spokesperson for the York Regional Police, said officers are investigating how the materials got into the home, why they were there and what the accused planned to do with them.

""Thankfully, nobody was injured in this particular case. But there's lots more to this investigation. That's why we really need some tips and help from the public as to how these materials got there, why they were there and what these two people were up to.""

Police had a presence at the home on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Pattenden said.

In a news release on Tuesday, police said dangerous chemicals being stored in a home can pose serious risks, including fires and explosions.

They urged members of public to call police if they see any suspicious activity, notice chemical odours, or unusual storage or stockpiling of chemicals and to take precautions.

Hazardous materials should never be eaten, inhaled or consumed, and even slightly inhaling a chemical can cause serious injury, they said. If a material is considered hazardous, police urge the public to leave the area and call 911.

""If you witness anyone dumping material that appears to be hazardous waste, get the best description as possible and call police immediately. Never approach the suspects,"" police said.

A man and woman are facing dozens of charges in connection to a human trafficking investigation that police said involved a teenager in the sex trade.

In February, police apprehended a 15-year-old girl after police and the human trafficking and exploitation unit became aware she was allegedly getting involved in the sex trade.

An investigation revealed that between December 2018 and March 2019, a man and woman recruited, procured and trafficked the 15-year-old and another 16-year-old girl from a home in central Edmonton, according to police.

“Human trafficking isn’t always an elaborate, organized operation like you see in the movies; it can be two people exploiting victims in a residence or hotel room next door,” Det. Dan Duiker said.

“If you notice unusual or suspicious activity, report it to police. A dispute between a couple could be much more than meets the eye. Your report could save a vulnerable youth from going down a path they can’t escape.”

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is defending a decision to give a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservative Party a role in determining which news organizations are eligible for government funding.

Eight Canadian organizations will select representatives to sit on an advisory panel that will decide how the government should dole out $600-million media support fund, the government announced Wednesday.

They are News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

Unifor — a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservatives under both Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer — represents more than 12,000 journalists and media workers in Canada.

In a statement posted to Facebook, Unifor said critics are mischaracterizing its role on the panel. The union says it will help define the criteria through which the funds will be allocated, but won't be directly involved in deciding who gets the money.

""There is a lot at stake as we work to protect and preserve our news industry in Canada and after years of discussion we finally have a path forward,"" the union said.

As It Happens has reached out to Unifor for comment.

Rodriguez spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the new panel. Here is part of their conversation.

I don't know if you had a chance to read Chris Selley at the National Post ... who says that that your putting Unifor on this panel is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. How do you respond?

We chose different organizations that represent journalists and different media across the country with different regions being represented, both official languages, the ethnic press.

We wanted to make sure that it was representative of the industry, and that's the reason why they're all there.

Why Unifor?

It represents thousands of employees from the news sector.

But it also represents a very, very strong bias, doesn't it? Because Unifor has made it quite clear that they call themselves ""the resistance."" They have put out publicity. I'm sure you've seen their publicity: ""The resistance: Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" If you want to have a panel that appears to be unbiased, how does that help you?

This is Andrew Scheer's opinion, and ...

Excuse me. No, no. This is not Andrew Scheer's opinion. I'm looking at a picture put out. This is Unifor Canada's picture.

We're talking about professionals, which is the case of all the groups there are on this list.

And the reason why we wanted to intervene is because professional journalism is one of the pillars of democracy. And the Conservatives may think that, ""Well, you know what? We shouldn't do anything and then let them all die.""

On the contrary, we're saying, ""No, we have to be there to support them with one clear principle — to respect the freedom and independence of the press.""

Unifor posted this image in a November 2018 tweet that read: 'Unifor’s National Executive Board started planning for the federal election today @AndrewScheer #canlab #canpoli.' (@UniforTheUnion/Twitter)

That's not the issue here. The issue is that you said you were going to put together a panel, an advisory panel, to decide who is going to get the funds, the $600 million worth of support to the media in this country, and that you would have an unbiased and an independent panel.

Yes, which is the case.

Mr. Rodriguez, have you not seen the publicity that Unifor is putting out calling themselves ""the resistance"" and saying, ""Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" Have you not seen that?

I know what you're talking about.

The Conservatives are saying that Unifor, any people working or any journalists, can be bought by this program, which is not the case, and I think it's an insult to professional journalists that build their career on integrity and on independence and on professionalism.

We're talking about the people on the panel. We're not talking about the journalists who might be benefiting from these funds. We saw that Unifor, it was quite partisan during the 2015 election campaign, that they put out attack ads against Stephen Harper's Conservatives, which surely helped you get elected. So, again, we're back to this problem of an appearance of bias. That if you have, if you are giving this position to Unifor, to the union, to decide who is going to get this funding, when it's an organization that has clearly come out ... going against your political enemies, that's a problem, isn't it?

This is repeating what Andrew Scheer is saying. And, again, I have to disagree with you, because if you look at the role the associations are playing, the role ... the journalists are playing, they're there to ask the tough questions — just exactly like what you're doing.

And also, this proves my point that we need that type of journalism of tough questions. And maybe the Conservatives, they don't want to hear those questions, but I think they're absolutely necessary in our democracy. So that's why the panel is in place. That's why we're moving forward.

But you've asked this panel to help decide who is a proper journalist and what's a proper news outlet and who is worthy of these funds. And who you've put on the panel that gets to decide that an organization that has a very, very strong, very partisan political statement.

But you keep repeating the same thing.

Because I'm not getting a very good answer from you.

I am answering your question and I'm saying that it's a panel with different people there from different sides of the industry, all representing professional journalists.

I guess what I'm trying to get to ... is that you want people to trust this fund, and Canadians want journalism they can trust. They want to believe that it's unbiased. But if the critics of your fund have always raised the alarm about any possible bias, that's why you wanted to have an independent panel. But haven't you just walked into that trap?

No, these panels represent people from all sides of industry. It represents work as a journalist, it represents the owners, it represents francophones, anglophones, the different regions, the ethnic media. It represents everybody.

And you don't think that there is a bias here, or a perception of bias, if you have as one of your panel members — and I know I'm asking you this once again, and I apologize for that, but I still haven't got a clear answer — do you not think that this is a problem of bias?

But I did answer your question.

You don't think that there's any bias on the part of Unifor, that Unifor doesn't have a political agenda?

No, you're saying that the journalists they represent have their own agenda.

No, no, I'm not saying that.

Yes, you're saying that.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm not. The panel you put together has Unifor as one of its members. And the question is that an organization that is clearly partisan and anti-Conservative, and have made that very clear, we're asking if that's an appropriate party to have on this panel?

We're saying that we need people from all walks of life. In this case ... people that represent the workers, the employers, the regions, the official languages and all of that to be represented there to make sure that this panel represents all of them, and that it takes neutral decisions on professional journalism.

Because we need professional journalism in our society. You're there to ask the tough questions. Again, that's exactly what you're doing and this is what we need.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/magic-mushrooms-decriminalization-denver-1.5128824,"Seriously, just legalize all recreational drugs.  The state has no business telling consenting adults what they can put in their own bodies.",0.0,14.0,"Voters narrowly made Denver the first U.S. city to decriminalize psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in ""magic mushrooms.""

Decriminalization led by a slim 51 per cent, according to preliminary figures on Tuesday's election released by Denver's Election Division. As many as 1,300 votes still remain to be counted, but that figure was not enough to swing the vote the other way, division spokesperson Alton Dillard said.

Final election results will be released on May 16, he said.

Organizers turned to the same strategy that marijuana activists used to decriminalize pot possession in the city in 2005. That move was followed by statewide legalization in 2012. A number of other states have since broadly allowed marijuana sales and use by adults.

Organizers say their only goal in the mushroom measure is to keep people out of jail in Denver for using or possessing the drug to cope with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and other conditions.

The initiative effectively decriminalizes use or possession of psilocybin by people 21 and older, making it the lowest enforcement priority for police and prosecutors. It does not legalize psilocybin or permit its sale by cannabis businesses.

Kevin Matthews, director of the Decriminalize Denver campaign, said psilocybin has helped him deal with depression for years.

""This is not something you have to take every day,"" the 33-year-old Denver native said. ""It provides a lot of lasting benefits, weeks and months after one experience.""

Used in religious practices

Psilocybin has been federally outlawed since the 1960s, when it was widely known as a recreational drug. The ban stymied medical research, but small studies in recent years have found the substance had positive effects on anxiety and depression for cancer patients.

Users have described seeing vivid colours and geometric patterns and experiencing powerful spiritual connections and emotions.

Magic mushrooms have been used in religious practices for decades because of their powerful effect on perceptions and spiritual experiences. Those same effects have appealed to recreational users dating to the 1960s counterculture movement.

A California effort to decriminalize psilocybin failed to qualify for the statewide ballot in 2018. Organizers in Oregon are trying to gather enough support to put an initiative to a statewide vote next year.

Mayor opposed initiative

It took the pro-psilocybin organizers in Denver three tries to develop language approved by city officials for the ballot. They collected more than 8,000 signatures to qualify for Tuesday's election.

Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and District Attorney Beth McCann opposed the initiative, but there was no organized campaign against decriminalization. The city's election largely focused on a six-way race for mayor and a heated effort to end Denver's ""urban camping"" ban that affects people without housing.

Voters roundly rejected an end to the camping ban. In the mayor's race, incumbent Michael Hancock will face a June 4 runoff election against challenger Jamie Giellis.

The mushroom ordinance also prevents city funds from being used to pursue criminal penalties on possession or use and creates a panel to study the effects of the change."

Quebec's proposed ban on religious symbols in the workplace is an ""existential type of attack"" that has people feeling like their freedom to express themselves was simply ""an illusion,"" claims a member of a multifaith group opposed to the bill.

""What you're being told is you have to give up who you are, give up your identity. I don't consider that a free choice,"" said Gregory Bordan, an orthodox Jewish lawyer in Montreal who is part of the Coalition Inclusion Quebec.

""Freedom of religion means … you're not forced to put aside your religion in order to participate in society,"" he told The Current's guest host Matt Galloway.

If passed, Bill 21 proposes to stop some civil servants from wearing religious symbols, such as the kippa, turban or hijab on the job. The rules would apply to teachers, police officers and judges, among others.

The Coalition Inclusion Quebec is one of four religious or inter-faith groups voicing their opinions on the bill at ongoing legislative hearings. A total of 36 groups have been invited to testify.

Protecting 'freedom of conscience'

Bordan said the group supports the separation of state and religion, but argued Bill 21 would ""institutionalize discrimination.""

That's not how Diane Guilbault, president of Pour les droits des femmes du Quebec, sees the legislation.

""The bill, at the heart, is to protect the freedom of conscience of the citizens,"" she told Galloway.

When I go to a government service ... I don't want to talk about religion. - Diane Guilbault, president of Pour les droits des femmes du Quebec

When someone wears a sign of their religion, Guilbault explains, they are ""displaying a discourse.""

""When I go to a government service, a public service, I don't want to talk about religion, so I don't want to know what religion the person is,"" she said, adding that symbols carry a great deal of meaning.

But Bordan contends the argument that someone imposes their ideas about religion on another by wearing religious symbols, like a kippa, is a ""fundamental mistake.""

""I don't believe for one moment that Madame Guilbault is going to feel that she has to convert to Judaism because I'm wearing a kippa,"" he said.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cannabis-use-statistics-canada-1.5121125,"I do hope this causes alcohol consumption to go down. Alcohol is terrible for you, and makes many people dangerous idiots. It's only legal because people are profiting off it.",10.0,60.0,"More Canadians say they've used cannabis recreationally since it was legalized last fall, particularly those aged 45 to 64 and males, according to Statistics Canada.

About 18 per cent of Canadians 15 and older, or about 5.3 million people, reported pot use in the last three months, the federal agency said in its quarterly report on Thursday.

Early indications point to more use right after it was legalized last October, when the reported use stood at 14 per cent.

""One of the things … unique with this survey is the number of respondents who said they're using for the first time. So they started, in this case, in the post-legalization period,"" said Michelle Rotermann, a senior analyst in Statistics Canada's health analysis division.

In the first three months of 2018, about 330,000 Canadians said they'd tried cannabis for the first time. A year later, it was up to 650,000, she said.

J.F. Crépault, a senior policy analyst at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), says the Toronto facility wants to see if the initial spike in use translates into longer-term, problematic use.

Following legalization in Colorado, for instance, cannabis use spiked, then rates went back down to about the same as in surrounding states where it remains illegal, Crépault said.

""Researchers sometimes refer to this as a 'straw fire effect' in the sense that it kind of burns bright for a very short amount of time and then goes back down,"" he said.

The greatest proportion of users are aged 18 to 25 (30 per cent) compared with people in their mid-20s and older. But an increasing proportion of new users were aged 45 and older.

The average age of a cannabis user in the country is now 38, Rotermann said.

Many of them are men. Cannabis use increased among males, from 16 per cent last year to 22 per cent so far this year. There was no change among females.

Daily, or almost daily, use of cannabis was unchanged, while weekly and occasional use increased.

Crépault said doctors and medical researchers are looking for any long-term increases in the number of people using cannabis, and, more important, people using cannabis more frequently or more heavily or, ""even worse, starting to use it earlier in life.""

Crépault said at CAMH they're keeping an eye on the national quarterly reports, but recognize that rates of use are an imperfect indicator: Not everyone in the population who uses is harmed.

Early evidence coming out of U.S. states with easier access to medical cannabis or legalized non-medical use of cannabis shows there seem to be reductions in opioid-related overdoses and fatal overdoses. That could be because people are either self-medicating or obtaining opioid prescriptions legitimately and taking the drug long-term and switching to cannabis instead, Crépault said.

He noted that in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, harm-reduction proponents are unofficially providing free cannabis to those who use injection drugs to reduce their opioid intake.

""If cannabis use does increase in the population, we need to make sure that we're also keeping track of patterns of alcohol use or opioid use. It'll take a long time for us to know for sure what the kind of relationships are between these.""

Overall, 15 per cent of cannabis users with a valid driver's licence reported driving within two hours of consuming. That amounts to 675,000 people. Experts advise waiting more than two hours before driving.

Of that group, about 15 per cent, or 125,000 people, also reported they'd consumed alcohol as well — a first for the agency to report.

""Any impaired driving is too much,"" Rotermann said, though she acknowledged that problems with impaired driving existed before legalization of cannabis.

An estimated 47 per cent of cannabis users, or 2.5 million Canadians, bought pot legally during that time, up from 23 per cent, or 954,000 people, during the same period a year ago.

As well, 38 per cent of users said they bought cannabis illegally during the first three months of 2019, compared with 51 per cent a year earlier."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jason-kenney-primary-residence-mp-expense-1.5120002,"Same, then I remembered it's pretty much what Nenshi did",3.0,27.0,"A federal committee that oversees House of Commons expenses has cleared Alberta Premier Jason Kenney of any wrongdoing for claiming a room in his mother's basement as his primary residence while he sat as a Conservative MP.

House of Commons expenditure reports show Kenney collected secondary-residence subsidies in Ottawa between 2012 and 2015 of about $10,000 each year as an MP for Calgary Midnapore, while his mother's retirement-community bungalow in Calgary was listed as his address with Elections Canada.

Daniel Paquette, the chief financial officer of the House of Commons, said Kenney, whose United Conservative Party won a majority in last month's provincial election, met all the requirements that were necessary at the time of his claims.

'Partisan considerations'

While conservative MPs on the Board of Internal Economy were satisfied with the ruling, they called the process a partisan attack and warned they could dig into historical expense claims, as well.

The Board of Internal Economy is responsible for the financial and administrative affairs of the House of Commons, and sets budgets for MP office spending, hospitality, travel expenses and security.

""I think, quite frankly, this board should be very concerned that this process was engaged for what can only be determined to have been partisan considerations to affect the ability of Mr. Kenney to conduct his campaign to become premier of Alberta,"" said MP Mark Strahl.

""So, quite frankly, I think this was a very disturbing case, because we can all play this game. We can go back to times when members of the Liberal Party were found to have been illegally claiming housing allowances,"" Strahl said.

Conservative MP Candice Bergen echoed her colleague's concerns.

""I think we have to think very, very seriously about what happened and how we were a part of it,"" she said.

The Board of Internal Economy is the governing body of the House of Commons and is responsible for expense policies. It is non-partisan.

Allegations raised before campaign

The allegations that Kenney was improperly claiming expenses was first raised by lawyer Kyle Morrow in January in the lead-up to the Alberta election campaign.

Morrow ran for the Alberta Liberals in the riding of Lacombe-Ponoka in the 2012 provincial election, which prompted the Kenney campaign to dismiss him as a ""failed Liberal candidate.""

The parliamentary investigation was initiated when Ontario Liberal MP Jennifer O'Connell formally requested it.

At the board hearing on Thursday, government house whip Mark Holland said he believes the investigation was important, even though it found no fault.

""I understand the concern. I would just simply state that the process of verifying, particularly when in a public forum and there are questions about expenses, there is an important need to verify the veracity of those expenses sometimes,"" he said.

Holland said he is satisfied with the findings."

... But I know they'll screw it up. Lol",-1.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

Maybe a dozen is misleading but it isn't very many, especially since only 25,000 weapons are seized annually.",4.0,34.0,"Police are scrambling to keep pace with criminals who are coming up with creative ways to supply Canada's black market with firearms.

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Wes Winkel, is the owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to pick out a possible straw buyer, and law enforcement authorities have been slow to identify them based on sales records. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

READ: Canadians want something done about gun violence — they just can't agree what

WATCH:

Guns are killing Canadians at a rate not seen in a decade, and gun control can only address part of the problem.

Dalee Sambo Dorough, international chair of the ICC, which is one of the six Arctic Indigenous organizations, known as permanent participants, that make up the Arctic Council along with the eight northern countries, called the U.S. actions a lack of leadership and a ""moral failure.""

""This is the first time the Arctic Council has failed to issue a declaration at the end of a two-year chairmanship, and it's a serious blow to the future of what is supposed to be a consensus-based body,"" Sambo Dorough said in a statement issued late Tuesday.

""Inuit are feeling the effects of climate change every day. While the U.S. government concerns itself with semantics, playing games with words, our people are witnessing the adverse impacts of climate change. What about us and our reality?""

Liubov Taian, the president of ICC Russia, said the reality of Arctic Inuit communities is being ignored.

""This is not just a question of words – it's about the long-term survival of our culture and communities,"" Taian said. ""Our traditional Inuit territory covers 40 per cent of the Arctic region and it is essential that governments work with us to deal with the threat of climate change throughout Inuit Nunaat, our Arctic homeland.""

Scramble for last minute compromise

The Arctic Council's mandate is to discuss sustainable development and environmental protection in the North. The countries' ministers and permanent participants meet biennially at the ministerial to take stock, transfer the rotating two-year chairmanship between the countries, and to sign a declaration that establishes their priorities for the next two years.

This year's ministerial was held in Rovaniemi, Finland, on Tuesday, where Finland handed the two-year rotating chairmanship of the organization over to Iceland.

But it was the first time in the Arctic Council's history that an agreement on the final declaration couldn't be reached.

Instead, the outgoing chair scrambled to cobble together a last-minute compromise with the Arctic states, and issued a one-page statement that pledged a joint commitment to the ""well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic, to sustainable development and to the protection of the Arctic environment,"" but that made no mention of climate change or the Paris climate agreement.

Indigenous voices sidelined

Unlike the usual declarations, which are developed with input from the Arctic Council's Indigenous organizations, the compromise joint ministerial statement was put together without them.

""We are worried about the undermining of the Arctic Council's credibility at a time when genuine leadership and a strong Arctic voice is needed,"" said Hjalmar Dahl, president of ICC Greenland.

Canada's ICC president Monica Ell-Kanayuk said U.S. actions reversed their own commitments made during their recent 2015-17 chairmanship.

""This position was taken by the U.S. administration despite the fact that the 2017 Fairbanks Declaration at the end of the U.S. chairmanship clearly cited the effects of climate change in the Arctic and 'the need for action at all levels,'"" she said.

The U.S. has been at odds with the rest of the Arctic community over climate issues since President Donald Trump announced his country's withdrawal from the Paris climate deal in 2017, a move blasted by other Arctic Council member states and something that continues to be a sticking point in bilateral meetings with Arctic Council nations.

James Stotts, ICC's Alaska president, said sidelining Indigenous contributions and views was a dangerous precedent for the Arctic Council, a forum that has long prided itself for including Arctic Indigenous groups since its founding.

""It's time to seriously listen to the solutions offered by ICC and the other permanent participants,"" he said. ""Its Inuit leadership expressed the unanimous view that given the challenges facing the region, now is the time for a unified response to the threat posed by climate change and its compounding spin-off effects.

""This unity is important for Inuit and all people of the Arctic, as well as the rest of the world."""

That is not what this law is about.....,4.0,902.0,"A Canadian non-profit that advocates for an open and affordable internet wants Ottawa to make electronic devices like smartphones easier to fix.

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."

Quebec's proposed ban on religious symbols in the workplace is an ""existential type of attack"" that has people feeling like their freedom to express themselves was simply ""an illusion,"" claims a member of a multifaith group opposed to the bill.

""What you're being told is you have to give up who you are, give up your identity. I don't consider that a free choice,"" said Gregory Bordan, an orthodox Jewish lawyer in Montreal who is part of the Coalition Inclusion Quebec.

""Freedom of religion means … you're not forced to put aside your religion in order to participate in society,"" he told The Current's guest host Matt Galloway.

If passed, Bill 21 proposes to stop some civil servants from wearing religious symbols, such as the kippa, turban or hijab on the job. The rules would apply to teachers, police officers and judges, among others.

The Coalition Inclusion Quebec is one of four religious or inter-faith groups voicing their opinions on the bill at ongoing legislative hearings. A total of 36 groups have been invited to testify.

Protecting 'freedom of conscience'

Bordan said the group supports the separation of state and religion, but argued Bill 21 would ""institutionalize discrimination.""

That's not how Diane Guilbault, president of Pour les droits des femmes du Quebec, sees the legislation.

""The bill, at the heart, is to protect the freedom of conscience of the citizens,"" she told Galloway.

When I go to a government service ... I don't want to talk about religion. - Diane Guilbault, president of Pour les droits des femmes du Quebec

When someone wears a sign of their religion, Guilbault explains, they are ""displaying a discourse.""

""When I go to a government service, a public service, I don't want to talk about religion, so I don't want to know what religion the person is,"" she said, adding that symbols carry a great deal of meaning.

But Bordan contends the argument that someone imposes their ideas about religion on another by wearing religious symbols, like a kippa, is a ""fundamental mistake.""

""I don't believe for one moment that Madame Guilbault is going to feel that she has to convert to Judaism because I'm wearing a kippa,"" he said.

""Chasing environmentalists might play well politically, but it's not actually relevant to the discussion that Alberta and Canada need to be having,"" added Simon Dyer of the clean-energy think tank Pembina Institute.

Both groups have been singled out by Kenney as examples of ones distorting the truth about the impact of the oilsands.

The premier has said government staff will be tasked with responding quickly to what he calls myths and lies. Kenney has also promised to fund lawsuits against offending environmentalists and to call a public inquiry into the role of money from U.S. foundations.

""Stay tuned,"" Energy Minister Sonya Savage said Tuesday. ""We'll have something to talk about next week.""

Environmental groups have already been discussing informally what the United Conservative government might have in mind and how they should react.

""We've been contacted,"" said Devon Page of Eco Justice, an environmental law firm. ""We've been saying to the groups, 'We're here. We'll respond and represent you as we have in the past.'

""What we're trying hard not to do is to do what I think the Kenney government wants, which is to get distracted.""

Dyer and Stewart said their groups are about 85 per cent funded by Canadians. The Pembina Institute was founded in Drayton Valley, Alta., and its headquarters remain in Calgary.

A lot of the rhetoric around our work and our contribution to Alberta has been based on complete misinformation. - Simon Dyer, Pembina Institute

Both called the war room political posturing aimed at the party's base.

""A lot of the rhetoric around our work and our contribution to Alberta has been based on complete misinformation,"" said Dyer, who noted Pembina has worked with virtually every major energy company in the province.

Stewart called the threats a rerun of the 2012 campaign against environmental groups fuelled by the right-wing The Rebel media group and led by Stephen Harper's federal Conservatives.

""We learned to play rope-a-dope,"" said Stewart. ""Stephen Harper was our best recruiter.

""We had people contacting us saying 'how do I lie down in front of a bulldozer?' We don't usually get a lot of those calls but we were getting a lot of those calls.""

Each group is confident in the accuracy of the facts it cites. Dyer said Pembina research has been used by investors, academics and governments.

'Not interested in polarizing this debate'

Stewart said the issue isn't facts, but how they are understood.

""Often what it is is a disagreement over which fact is important. Industry will say 'we're reducing emissions per barrel.' We'll say 'emissions are going up.' Both statements are true and it depends which you think is more important.""

Cara Zwibel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the Kenney government must tread carefully. It's okay to defend your position, but not to threaten, she said.

""If we're talking about initiating lawsuits against individuals or organizations on the basis of speaking out on issues of public importance, then that raises serious problems,"" she said. ""Then we have a much more obvious impact and potential violation on freedom of expression.""

It's difficult to see that this sort of general debate they're going to be able to shutdown with defamation law. - Sean Ward, lawyer

The province could possibly expose itself to legal action if its statements harm a group or individual — say, by putting them at the centre of a Twitter firestorm, said an Edmonton lawyer.

""There's certainly some kind of moral responsibility in terms of understanding that kind of highly charged rhetoric,"" said Sean Ward, who practises media law. ""You have to understand the consequences that are likely to follow.""

Ward said any cases the government funds would also be tough to win.

""There are a lot of available defences. It's difficult to see that this sort of general debate they're going to be able to shutdown with defamation law.""

About 18 per cent of Canadians 15 and older, or about 5.3 million people, reported pot use in the last three months, the federal agency said in its quarterly report on Thursday.

Early indications point to more use right after it was legalized last October, when the reported use stood at 14 per cent.

""One of the things … unique with this survey is the number of respondents who said they're using for the first time. So they started, in this case, in the post-legalization period,"" said Michelle Rotermann, a senior analyst in Statistics Canada's health analysis division.

In the first three months of 2018, about 330,000 Canadians said they'd tried cannabis for the first time. A year later, it was up to 650,000, she said.

J.F. Crépault, a senior policy analyst at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), says the Toronto facility wants to see if the initial spike in use translates into longer-term, problematic use.

Following legalization in Colorado, for instance, cannabis use spiked, then rates went back down to about the same as in surrounding states where it remains illegal, Crépault said.

""Researchers sometimes refer to this as a 'straw fire effect' in the sense that it kind of burns bright for a very short amount of time and then goes back down,"" he said.

The greatest proportion of users are aged 18 to 25 (30 per cent) compared with people in their mid-20s and older. But an increasing proportion of new users were aged 45 and older.

The average age of a cannabis user in the country is now 38, Rotermann said.

Many of them are men. Cannabis use increased among males, from 16 per cent last year to 22 per cent so far this year. There was no change among females.

Daily, or almost daily, use of cannabis was unchanged, while weekly and occasional use increased.

Crépault said doctors and medical researchers are looking for any long-term increases in the number of people using cannabis, and, more important, people using cannabis more frequently or more heavily or, ""even worse, starting to use it earlier in life.""

Crépault said at CAMH they're keeping an eye on the national quarterly reports, but recognize that rates of use are an imperfect indicator: Not everyone in the population who uses is harmed.

Early evidence coming out of U.S. states with easier access to medical cannabis or legalized non-medical use of cannabis shows there seem to be reductions in opioid-related overdoses and fatal overdoses. That could be because people are either self-medicating or obtaining opioid prescriptions legitimately and taking the drug long-term and switching to cannabis instead, Crépault said.

He noted that in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, harm-reduction proponents are unofficially providing free cannabis to those who use injection drugs to reduce their opioid intake.

""If cannabis use does increase in the population, we need to make sure that we're also keeping track of patterns of alcohol use or opioid use. It'll take a long time for us to know for sure what the kind of relationships are between these.""

McLeod said he'll be presenting this and other ideas to the federal government in Ottawa within the next month.

The premier wants Canada to triple its icebreaker fleet within five years and triple its deepwater port capacity within 10 years.

""I think that you see other Arctic countries becoming significant players in the Arctic and we need to be sure that Canada and the North is ready for when that happens,"" McLeod said.

Both China and Russia have shown growing interest in the Arctic. The Barents Observer of Norway reported in February that Russia plans to use supersonic jet fighters to make regular patrols of the North Pole, something Russia hasn't done since the Cold War.

McLeod said Inuvik, located 100 kilometres from the Beaufort Sea, should play a key security role.

""We'd like to see a full military base, preferably in Inuvik, of about 5,000 permanent personnel,"" he said.

While the federal government announced last fall that Yellowknife will be home to a new Arctic Region Coast Guard base, McLeod said there should be a base in the Beaufort Sea.

Officials from all three northern territories are meeting in Yellowknife on Wednesday. The Arctic Security Working Group will discuss safety, security and defence issues, along with the commander of the Canadian Forces' Joint Task Force North.

It's unknown whether McLeod's vision of a more militarized North will be part of the federal government's much-anticipated Arctic Policy Framework, which may be released as early as June.

The new Arctic policy initiative was announced in December 2016 to replace the 2009 Northern Strategy and the 2010 Statement on Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy under Stephen Harper's Conservative government.

The current federal government recently added foreign affairs and national security, as well as reconciliation, to the list of themes the new policy will address.

""We've been working with the government of Canada on a 10-year vision and plan for Arctic Canada and I've been going to a lot of Arctic conferences and realizing that Canada is falling way far behind the other Arctic countries,"" McLeod said.

""So we're coming up with a plan where the Arctic will become a critical international arena of economics, science and infrastructure and environment strategy.""

Icebreaker U

In order to increase understanding of the Arctic, McLeod envisions a Canada-wide civil service rotation program in which senior bureaucrats from the South spend time living in the North. He'd also like to see a federal department of Arctic affairs and a northern immigration program.

""We think that we need more immigration and the fact is we don't have enough people up here. We're also looking at having a permanent offshore Arctic university school on one of the existing icebreakers,"" he said.

McLeod said he takes climate change and Arctic ecology ""very, very seriously."" His vision for the N.W.T., however, remains steeped in fostering transportation corridors and pipelines to accommodate the oil and gas industry.

McLeod says innovation is needed to find alternate energy sources for 20 diesel-dependent communities beyond solar and wind, given that neither of those can supply continuous, year-round power to communities.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,another fun one to watch out for is progressive arguments whenever the LGBT and islamic communities are at odds with each other. that one really makes peoples' heads spin!,1.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Djemila Benhabib, representing the Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité, said Tuesday that some Muslim women who wear the hijab are 'fundamentalists.' (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."
https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2019/05/10/beer-store-union-launches-ad-blitz-attacking-premier-doug-ford-for-threatening-7000-jobs.html,Not just the public. The monopoly is even broader than that as the bars all have to use them as their supplier as well.,11.0,70.0,"Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

Springtime has become synonymous with wildfire season in many parts of Canada, and it's time the preparation and damage control reflected this, says Ed Struzik.

Our changing climate is directly impacting the frequency and intensity of wildfires, and it's important that Canada's approach to combating these blazes — and their resulting weather systems — is re-visited, he told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

""Our traditional response to wildfire is not going to be good enough in the future,"" the author of Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future said.

Struzik, who is also a fellow at the Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy at Queen's University, spoke with Tremonti about the devastating wildfire south of High Level, Alta., that has led to the evacuation of about 5,000 people, and what the future of wildfires looks like.

Here is part of their conversation.

Residents in High Level, Alta., are preparing to leave their homes following an evacuation alert. (Deb Stecyk)

What worries you about what's going on around High Level right now?

Well this is not the new normal, but it's the new reality. We saw it in B.C. in the last two years, and Alberta the year before, Waterton National Park. Ontario got hit hard last year.

I think this is what we're going to be seeing more of every summer.

And as the fires burn bigger and hotter we're also seeing a real change in weather systems. There's something called the firenado. What do you know about that?

Ed Struzik is an environmental writer and photographer. (Ed Struzik/Twitter)

What we're seeing now is these pyroCbs [pyrocumulonimbus clouds], these fire-driven thunderstorms on the landscape. There was an astonishing four that occurred in 2017 in B.C., and one simultaneously in neighbouring Washington. And I was talking to people from the U.S. naval defence lab in Washington, D.C., who've been watching this along with people from NASA and other people from around the world, and they were just stunned to see that kind of fire-weather activity

It happened not only in B.C. It happened in Texas last year. It's happened in Portugal. It's happened in South America and South Africa. We're starting to see these major, major weather events, fire-weather events, spreading around the world. And that is throwing everybody for a loop. That's spinning heads.

So there've been forest fires before but why do they create a weather system like that with lightning storms?

They're just so hot that they just suck up all of the moisture, and it's essentially like a classic thunderstorm that you have when it gets very hot and humid and it sucks up all the moisture and the heat and then raises it up, creates these pyrocumulus clouds, except there's a lot of carbon and dirty material that it's sucking up from the ground that's been burning. And so they sometimes call that the 'dirty thunderstorm' but it can also create lightning.

Dramatic video from southern California shows a fiery tornado — or ""firenado"" — swirling on the scorched countryside near the community of Phelan in August, 2016. Swirling column of flame moves slowly towards highway 1:02

For example in 2016 we saw one of these pyroCb events ignite a cluster of fire more than 30 kilometres away from the fire's front. And how do you deal with that if you're a firefighter? I mean it's kind of like a Game of Thrones. You don't know where the dragon is going to be exhaling next. And I think that's what we have to start dealing with. This is the new reality, and our traditional response to wildfire is not going to be good enough in the future.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

The Chinese tech executive at the centre of a high-profile international extradition case is seeking to have her case thrown out.

Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer for Chinese telecom giant Huawei, told the the B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver Wednesday that she is the subject of an abuse of process by border officials, RCMP, the FBI and the government of Canada.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.

WATCH: Huawei Canada spokesperson details problems with case

She stands accused of violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran by allegedly misrepresenting Huawei’s ownership and control of Skycom, a company doing business in the Middle Eastern country.

Speaking outside the court, Huawei Canada’s vice-president of media affairs Benjamin Howes said the application to toss the case was based on three key arguments.

Howes said Meng had not actually broken sanctions against Iran, as alleged by U.S. authorities, and had been clear and above board about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom.

He further argued that Meng had been the subject of “serious and repeated violations” of her charter rights at the direction of the FBI and at the hands of Canadian authorities.

“The RCMP intentionally delayed the presentation of the arrest warrant in order to carry out the unlawful detention and search against Ms. Meng,” Howes said.

“This was done under the pretense of a routine border check.”

Meng’s legal team will further argue the sanctions on financial services she is accused of violating are not imposed in Canada, meaning the case does not meet the “double criminality” requirement of Canada’s extradition agreement with the U.S., and is therefore not lawful, Howes said.

In court, Meng’s lawyer Scott Fenton also argued that comments by U.S. President Donald Trump prove the case is politically motivated.

The U.S. and China have tried to keep Meng’s case separate from their trade dispute, although Trump has said he would consider intervening in the case if it would help forge a trade deal with Beijing.

Fenton called Trump’s comments “intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law.”

Wednesday’s court appearance also saw Meng granted the right to move to a home she owns in Vancouver’s posh Shaughnessy neighbourhood.

The 46-year-old has been living at another of her two multimillion-dollar Vancouver homes on a $10-million bail. She is also under 24-hour surveillance by a private security company as well as electronic monitoring.

WATCH (March 4, 2019): Does Meng have a strong case against U.S. extradition?

The Canadian government has refused to intervene in the case, citing the rule of law.

While Meng fights her extradition, she has also launched a lawsuit against the federal government, the Canada Border Services Agency and RCMP.

Meng claims Canada violated her constitutional rights when officers detained and questioned her for three hours at Vancouver International Airport before notifying her of her arrest.

The United States is now putting pressure on its British ally to stop the Chinese telecom from establishing a 5G network in the U.K.

Speaking in London, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo invoked the politics of Margaret Thatcher.

“”Ask yourself this: Would the Iron Lady be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption and coercion?,” he said.

“Would she allow China to control the internet of the future?”

Careful not to anger China, the British government would only say that there is no final decision on the matter.

Canada is already facing Beijing’s wrath.

Since Meng’s arrest, two Canadians — ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor — have been detained in China in apparent retaliation.

Trade issues have also become strained with China blocking imports of Canadian pork and canola.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mainland-moose-nova-scotia-decline-1.5148572,"Mainland moose in Nova Scotia haven't been (legally) hunted since the 1930s. The problem is habitat change (clearcuts in particular), parasites from deer, ticks 
 and too many ATV roads everywhere.",11.0,34.0,"Zigzagging in an airplane over forests and rivers, Thomas Millette scanned the Nova Scotia landscape using special thermal-imaging equipment in search of one thing: the endangered mainland moose.

The Massachusetts scientist had been directed by officials with the Department of Lands and Forestry to the most promising areas of the province to find the animal. But the searches turned up very few.

In one 592-square-kilometre section south of Halifax, just one moose was spotted. None were seen in the Liscomb Game Sanctuary, a conservation area in eastern Nova Scotia. Three were counted in two areas totalling more than 550 square kilometres in Guysborough County.

""It is clear that moose populations on the mainland are very low,"" Randy Milton, a manager of wildlife resources with the department, wrote in an email to Millette after reviewing the data.

The surveys, conducted in the winters of 2017 and 2018 for the provincial government, conclude the mainland moose population is in steep decline. This summer, a team of scientists will begin to put together a ""status report,"" and will ultimately determine what, if anything, should be done to save the animal.

In the early 1900s thousands of mainland moose roamed Nova Scotia. By the 1930s there were only around 3,200 left, a number that fell to 1,000 by the early 2000s. Now, according to one of Millette's estimates, there could be fewer than 100 mainland moose remaining in the wild.

The mainland moose was declared an endangered species in Nova Scotia in 2003. (Department of Natural Resources)

The mainland moose, which was listed as endangered in 2003 and is also known as Alces alces americana, is native to Nova Scotia. They are a different subspecies from the moose on Cape Breton Island, which were introduced from Alberta in the 1940s and are far more abundant.

The results of the aerial surveys are among 535 pages of records released to CBC through a freedom-of-information request.

Lands and Forestry staff note as part of the 2017 survey a series of ""drivers"" that could be contributing to the decline in the mainland moose. They include climate change, changes in the forest, problems with access to good food, land management practices, road development and poaching.

Millette's work was in response to a 2016 report by Nova Scotia's auditor general that concluded Lands and Forestry was not doing enough to protect endangered species, and called on the department to reassess the population status of the mainland moose, as required under the province's Endangered Species Act.

Millette, who hails from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, is a global expert in designing instruments to count wildlife from the air. He specializes in collecting aerial data to estimate animal population numbers, and his projects have included censuses for moose in Vermont and caribou in Alaska.

After Millette's second Nova Scotia survey, he wrote: ""It is safe to say that if you were to double or triple the moose density set forth in this survey, there remains a paucity of moose on the mainland.""

Nova Scotia banned the hunting of mainland moose in the 1930s. (Submitted by Bob Bancroft)

As part of his work in Nova Scotia, Millette used a combination of thermal imaging and high resolution photography. Several images a second were taken from a plane and then analyzed for any moose along each flight path, called transects.

From his moose counts Millette was able to calculate the moose population density for each area, and from there he estimated the population density. As part of his 2017 summary report, he estimated there could be as few as 85 moose on the mainland.

But even though Millette was hired to estimate moose presence, he said in an interview it would be a mistake to use his data to estimate the moose population because he only surveyed small areas of the province.

""The basic problem is that we know that no organism is homogeneously scattered across the landscape,"" he said. ""That's what makes the census things so tricky ... It's a very small bit of data. That it would be a mistake to interpret that as being the densities across the province, because it was never intended to be that.""

Milton agrees. Although he recognizes the moose population is ""extremely low in the surveyed areas,"" and overall moose numbers have decreased since the last time the population was known, Milton insists the province doesn't know ""how far down those numbers have actually gone.""

He said it's better to use Millette's numbers to help figure out where the moose are on the mainland, and not try to estimate the population.

""Don't want to be premature and saying that numbers are so, so low that we have no hope,"" he said in an interview. ""We want to be able to provide a good estimate on what the numbers actually are, rather than a guess.""

This summer, the province will work with Millette to better understand where the moose are in the province, and how to protect those areas. A team of scientists will examine whether it's feasible to make a ""recovery plan,"" which would aim to save the mainland moose from becoming extinct in Nova Scotia.

Millett's 2017 report includes a section entitled Questions. But the 16 pages that follow are entirely redacted under a section of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act that says information can be hidden from public view if it's considered ""advice to public body or minister.""

It's unclear what information about moose could be so secretive.

Karen Beazley, a professor at the School for Resource and Environmental Studies at Dalhousie University, would like to know. Fifteen years ago she was part of a team that assessed moose habitat and population viability in Nova Scotia.

""I think that moose are sort of a canary in a coal mine,"" said Beazley, who reviewed the documents obtained by CBC. ""If we can do some things to help the moose, that's going to help many, many other species that will suffer the same declines if we continue with the same kind of habitat loss and fragmentation that we've been doing so far.""

In fact, she said what's left can't be described as moose ""populations"" anymore. They are just ""localized remnant groups,"" she said, or what remains of what once was a vibrant population.

In October 2014, the remains of a poached moose were found in the woods off Highway 101 near Mount Uniacke, N.S. The meat had been removed and the hide and head left behind. (Department of Natural Resources)

Using a scientific model, Beazley said in order for moose to have a good chance of surviving over the next 100 years in mainland Nova Scotia the population would need to be somewhere between 185 and 370 animals.

The individuals in the population would have to be able to interact with one another, and not be isolated as they are today. In those geographically isolated groups, there would need to be 185 to 370 per group in order for each population to be healthy.

Beazley admits the current status is a long way from those numbers, but she's not ready to give up on the moose, stressing it is possible for species to recover from the brink of extinction.

She said it would help the moose survive if the remnant groups could get from one region of the province to another, and not be isolated from other moose groups because of highways or roads.

The other thing that would help, Beazley said, would be to decrease the number of forest roads, which open up moose areas to poachers, coyotes and deer. Deer carry a brain worm parasite that kills moose.

Millette's surveys also identified deer, and he had expected to find them in large numbers where there weren't many moose. It was a surprise that only three deer were counted in the Liscomb Game Sanctuary. Milton later noted it appears there are large areas of the mainland with almost no deer or moose ""evident at all.""

Beazley expects some people will claim that moose have no future in Nova Scotia because the province will become too warm due to climate change. She doesn't buy that argument.

""Historically, they have existed much further south than Nova Scotia,"" she said. ""Nova Scotia will have a lot of sites that will be resilient to climate change … so climate change isn't necessarily going to make this area unfit for moose to survive.""

We don’t need your divisive BS here.",5.0,165.0,"A lawyer representing a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after she spent eight years on death row in Pakistan says she has arrived in Canada.

Pakistani officials and others involved in the case said Wednesday that Asia Bibi had left Pakistan to be reunited with her daughters in Canada, where they had been granted asylum. Her lawyer, Saif-ul Malook, said she had already arrived in Canada.

Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2009 after a quarrel with a fellow farmworker. Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction last year and she had been in protective custody since then.

Islamic extremists have rioted over the case and threatened to kill her. The same radical Islamists, many of whom have been jailed for their threats, also urged the overthrow of the government following Bibi's acquittal.

Wilson Chawdhry of the British Pakistani Christian Association told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he received a text message from a British diplomat saying ""Asia is out."" A close friend of Bibi also confirmed that she had left the country, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

A statement from the association says it received confirmation around 8 p.m. ET Tuesday that Bibi ""had safely exited Pakistan.""

""Asia Bibi bravely held on to her faith through the most brutal of incarcerations that involved her having access to sunlight for two hours per month,"" the statement says. ""Now she finally travels to Canada to be reunited with her children.""

Chowdhry said in the statement released by the association that Bibi is ""unwell"" after suffering a decade of isolation both in and out of captivity.

""She must be treated with utmost care and receive appropriate medical care now she is free,"" he said.

Officials at Pakistan's interior and foreign ministries also confirmed her departure, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would not discuss the case Wednesday.

""I have no comment,"" Trudeau said. ""Obviously, there are sensitive privacy issues and security issues on this and unfortunately I can't comment at this time.""

Global Affairs Canada said Wednesday it ""has no comment on this matter."" Trudeau said last November that Canada was then in talks with the Pakistani government about Bibi.

The friend, who last spoke to her on Tuesday, said Bibi and her husband Ashiq Masih had spent the last several weeks getting their documents in order. He said she was longing to see her daughters, with whom she talked almost daily from her secure location, protected by Pakistani security forces.

Chawdhry said he had been in regular contact with Bibi's husband throughout the ordeal as well as with several diplomats involved in international efforts to get her to safety.

The case has brought international attention to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, which carries an automatic death penalty. The mere suspicion of blasphemy against Islam is enough to ignite mob lynchings in the country. The accusation of blasphemy has also been used to intimidate religious minorities and to settle scores.

Radical Islamists have made the punishment of blasphemy a major rallying cry, bringing tens of thousands into the streets and paralyzing major cities.

Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, has been celebrated as a martyr by hardliners since he was hanged for the killing, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Pakistan's minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated later that year after demanding justice for Bibi.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed not to be intimidated by the rioters, saying the rule of law would decide Bibi's fate. But she was denied permission to leave the country for several months until sentiments cooled.

A three-judge Supreme Court panel in January cleared Bibi's final legal hurdle when they ruled there was no compelling reason to overturn the court's earlier acquittal. The judges accused those who charged Bibi with blasphemy of committing perjury, but said they would not be tried because of the sensitivity of the case. The judges upheld the blasphemy law."

TORONTO – The Ontario government says it plans to join British Columbia’s proposed class action lawsuit against dozens of opioid manufacturers.

Attorney General Caroline Mulroney says the province will introduce legislation that, if passed, would enable Ontario’s participation in the suit launched late last year.

She says Ontario would invest any potential awards won from the litigation into frontline mental health and addiction services.

British Columbia filed the proposed class action against dozens of pharmaceutical companies in a bid to recoup the health-care costs associated with opioid addiction.

Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

READ MORE: Atlantic Canada clean energy collaboration receives $2M federal investment

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

Used fuel from the Bruce Power plant is stored in the form of pellets that fit into tubes. These tubes are collected into bundles and packed into carbon steel tubes coated in copper. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository.

Good paying jobs are important given that

*By 2036, Canada could have fewer than three people in the labour force for every person aged 65 and over who is not in the labour force*",4.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

About 18 per cent of Canadians 15 and older, or about 5.3 million people, reported pot use in the last three months, the federal agency said in its quarterly report on Thursday.

Early indications point to more use right after it was legalized last October, when the reported use stood at 14 per cent.

""One of the things … unique with this survey is the number of respondents who said they're using for the first time. So they started, in this case, in the post-legalization period,"" said Michelle Rotermann, a senior analyst in Statistics Canada's health analysis division.

In the first three months of 2018, about 330,000 Canadians said they'd tried cannabis for the first time. A year later, it was up to 650,000, she said.

J.F. Crépault, a senior policy analyst at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), says the Toronto facility wants to see if the initial spike in use translates into longer-term, problematic use.

Following legalization in Colorado, for instance, cannabis use spiked, then rates went back down to about the same as in surrounding states where it remains illegal, Crépault said.

""Researchers sometimes refer to this as a 'straw fire effect' in the sense that it kind of burns bright for a very short amount of time and then goes back down,"" he said.

The greatest proportion of users are aged 18 to 25 (30 per cent) compared with people in their mid-20s and older. But an increasing proportion of new users were aged 45 and older.

The average age of a cannabis user in the country is now 38, Rotermann said.

Many of them are men. Cannabis use increased among males, from 16 per cent last year to 22 per cent so far this year. There was no change among females.

Daily, or almost daily, use of cannabis was unchanged, while weekly and occasional use increased.

Crépault said doctors and medical researchers are looking for any long-term increases in the number of people using cannabis, and, more important, people using cannabis more frequently or more heavily or, ""even worse, starting to use it earlier in life.""

Crépault said at CAMH they're keeping an eye on the national quarterly reports, but recognize that rates of use are an imperfect indicator: Not everyone in the population who uses is harmed.

Early evidence coming out of U.S. states with easier access to medical cannabis or legalized non-medical use of cannabis shows there seem to be reductions in opioid-related overdoses and fatal overdoses. That could be because people are either self-medicating or obtaining opioid prescriptions legitimately and taking the drug long-term and switching to cannabis instead, Crépault said.

He noted that in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, harm-reduction proponents are unofficially providing free cannabis to those who use injection drugs to reduce their opioid intake.

""If cannabis use does increase in the population, we need to make sure that we're also keeping track of patterns of alcohol use or opioid use. It'll take a long time for us to know for sure what the kind of relationships are between these.""

Overall, 15 per cent of cannabis users with a valid driver's licence reported driving within two hours of consuming. That amounts to 675,000 people. Experts advise waiting more than two hours before driving.

Of that group, about 15 per cent, or 125,000 people, also reported they'd consumed alcohol as well — a first for the agency to report.

Police are watching for impaired driving from alcohol, cannabis and other substances. (CBC News)

""Any impaired driving is too much,"" Rotermann said, though she acknowledged that problems with impaired driving existed before legalization of cannabis.

An estimated 47 per cent of cannabis users, or 2.5 million Canadians, bought pot legally during that time, up from 23 per cent, or 954,000 people, during the same period a year ago.

As well, 38 per cent of users said they bought cannabis illegally during the first three months of 2019, compared with 51 per cent a year earlier."

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/snc-lavalin-trial-corruption-bribery-1.5153429,That’s called being sunk.,2.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

(Yes I know the argument is that it will take time with reevaluation every year, but that's a problem with this four year cycle)",3.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

The Mounties released a statement last week defending their handling of the case and — as late as Monday — had turned aside further requests for comment."

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

Michael Chertoff has a warning for Canada about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Canada's federal government is currently deciding whether Huawei can be trusted to build the next generation of Internet infrastructure across the country.

Chertoff, who was the United States' homeland security secretary under former president George W. Bush, says that decision could have major consequences for Canada's relationships with both China and the United States.

Meanwhile, Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is due to appear in a Vancouver court where a judge will consider an extradition request from the United States.

Here is part of Chertoff's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.

Mr. Chertoff, how is the United States likely to respond if Justin Trudeau agrees to allow Huawei 5G network to be a principal part of our system?

I think it's going to raise concerns about the security of your system.

We've seen stories recently, in fact, involving more back doors or problems with Chinese software and hardware.

So that's going to create some obstacles to the ability to rapidly share data because they're concerned that there'll be a compromise.

Chertoff cautions Canadians to reconsider pursuing a 5G network deal with Chinese tech giant Huawei. (Reuters)

You know that China says that Huawei is a private company — that the Chinese government is not involved with it and that there are firewalls that would protect these networks from any kind of Chinese influence. What does the United States think of that?

I think most Americans are skeptical of that for a number of reasons.

First of all, the Chinese clearly anoint certain companies as champions and support them.

And if you just look at what happened recently, with respect to Canadians being arrested in China as retaliation for the arrest of a senior Huawei official, it suggests a degree of solicitude for the company by the Chinese government that is is not consistent with the idea that they're independent.

To could give the Chinese the ability to occupy a pivotal part of your infrastructure, one that will be, as I say, the commanding heights of the next 10 or 20 years of the economy, you're giving them enormous leverage in any dispute.

You're giving them a surface area for which they can potentially take intellectual property or otherwise compromise confidential material and you have to, I think, seriously view China as a rival, if not an adversary.

The U.S. is seeking the extradition of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, but Canada appears to be bearing the brunt of China's displeasure in a situation that blurs the lines between politics and justice. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

What could they potentially do?

Well, they could either find or embed pathways in to compromise networks and allow the theft of intellectual property.

They could introduce disruption or latency into the network because it's not just the hardware and software that you first install. It's all of the updates, the patches, everything you do to them to tend to and monitor the system going forward.

It's not just a question of taking data and either misusing it or stealing intellectual property. This will actually be part of the mechanism that controls your industrial control systems and your operating systems.

So the person who dominates that, in a way, has the ability to affect everything from your power grid to your air traffic control system to your even your sensitive national security infrastructure.

The Canadian government is deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention of two Canadians in China. Read my statement: <a href=""https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc"">https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc</a> —@cafreeland

As you mentioned, we have two Canadians who are detained in China, held in isolation. Two others on death row. In other matters, our trade is being deeply effected as the Chinese shut us out of the markets. All this because of this extradition request from your country for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meanwhile, your president is busy securing a comprehensive free trade agreement with China and moving ahead and benefiting. So do you understand why Canadians might feel like we're being played here?

Well, I don't think that's a fair inference. Look, I think there are a couple of different things.

First of all, I mean obviously the security relationship the U.S. and Canada have is a very strong one. We're allies and I don't think anybody believes the U.S. is an ally of China — nor is it clear to me what's going to come out of this trade agreement.

I think what actually is demonstrated by Chinese behaviour is that when you're touching on what they view as one of their national champions, they will use any leverage they have to punish you.

And that ought to cause people to ask the question: well geez, if we give them the keys to the kingdom on our 5G network, what will they do if they don't like something we do in the future?

But wait a second. We arrested Meng Wanzhou at your behest, at your government's behest, and we're being punished while you move ahead with getting the trade deals that we're shut out of now. So I guess the question is, you know, at some point this seems rather unfair to us.

First of all, I don't know whether the Chinese aren't going to try to punish the U.S.

But if you're asking me why the Chinese decided they were going to focus on Canada in retaliating, I think it suggests they're trying to bully Canada and it may be that they feel they can get away with it more with Canada or that they can intervene before the extradition gets done.

Well, maybe the United States should start pushing back at our behest a bit.

I think we may see some further developments. I would not describe your relationship between China and the U.S. as a warm and fuzzy relationship.

There are a lot of different deals going on but I would be very careful not to have the Chinese try to drive a wedge between the Canadians and the Americans, by making it seem as if they're picking on one and not on the other.

Well, President Trump has said that he may trade Meng Wanzhou for getting his trade deals. So, maybe we're being played by your country as well.

I don't know what you're referring to and I don't read Twitter as a map for what's going to happen.

I would not presume anybody knows what's going to be the next step in all this because there are a lot of balls in the air.

Is it not true that President Trump suggested that he could exchange Meng Wanzhou for a trade deal with China?

He often says all kinds of different things, which never come to pass. So I'm not going to speculate as to what was in his head. But I'm not going to presume that this has any realistic prospect of happening.

You are kindred spirits.,2.0,2.0,"VANCOUVER—A plan to shift Canada’s entire economy to battle climate change has been launched in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.

The proposed Green New Deal is being endorsed by David Suzuki and 60 signatories — including the largest unions, youth leaders, Indigenous groups and environmental economists.

It’s been inspired by some U.S. Democrats’ call to shift jobs and the economy from fossil fuels to renewable energy and infrastructure.

And just as that American version has been called unworkable, unrealistic and even “socialist” by conservatives there, Canada’s nascent iteration will likely come under attack in the months leading up to this fall’s federal election.

That doesn’t deter Nayeli Jimenez, 28, a Vancouver-based member of the youth-led national climate group Our Time.

“We can’t afford not to do this,” the art director for a publishing house told Star Vancouver ahead of the plan’s unveiling Monday.

Majority of Canadians support a ‘Green New Deal,’ poll finds

Jason Kenney’s Alberta election vow will not derail national carbon tax, says environment minister

Canada warming faster than the rest of the world, says Environment Canada

“We’re feeling an intense sense of emergency and anxiety because our futures are on the line.”

The Pact for a Green New Deal, according to its founding document, aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically — by half in the next decade. Its creators insist that by shifting spending and by protecting and retraining workers, governments can create a million jobs.

Details will be hammered out after a nationwide series of town halls, but four pillars have been set out for the framework: that it apply science in meeting the scale and urgency of the climate crisis; that it focus on job creation and ensure workers in oil-and-gas sectors receive retraining; that it ensure the transition is socially just and doesn’t hurt those at the bottom of the economic ladder; and that it respects Indigenous rights.

The essence of the plan is to focus on job creation, clean infrastructure such as transit systems, renovating buildings and boosting green technology development.

“We’re not asking for something radical — we’re asking for something that’s actually very rational,” Jimenez said. “It’s about moving investments from fossil fuels into clean infrastructure that will create far more jobs.”

The federal government estimates that Alberta’s oilsands employ 400,000 people directly and indirectly. And the country’s entire energy sector employs more than double that, or roughly 900,000 direct and indirect jobs.

Asked about concerns such a dramatic industrial proposal is unrealistic, Jimenez said it will actually save the country billions.

“You question how you’re going to pay for it, how you’re going to be able to pull it off,” she replied. “It’s a really valid question — but why aren’t we asking how much our inaction is going to cost us?”

According to energy economist Marc Eliesen — former president and CEO of Ontario Hydro (now Hydro One), BC Hydro and Manitoba Hydro — moving away from fossil fuels is both inevitable, and already happening amongst investors.

But, he warned in an interview Sunday, while “the transition has to take place, it has to be more than slogans.”

During his time as Ontario’s deputy minister of energy, Eliesen also sat on the board of director of Calgary-based Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil company which also runs the country’s largest biofuels plant and produces 111 megawatts of wind power.

He said when it comes to renewable energy, “the first to call the tune on this are investors themselves,” not governments. When told of the Canadian Green New Deal’s aims, he agreed it’s essential that workers be protected as the economy shifts.

“No one from economics’ ‘green school’ or investors in the oil industry are suggesting we stop producing what we’re producing,” Eliesen told the Star. “The transition is clearly not going to come immediately — you’ve got an oil worker who’s been working for decades, the retraining process for someone like that is going to take time, let’s be honest about that.

“There must be some support mechanisms for people undergoing retraining for new areas of generation electricity or transportation.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

The Green New Deal’s plan to substantially achieve that workforce shift, while investing billions in renewable energy and green infrastructure, is “quite frankly the only way to go,” Eliesen believes, as the oil sector heads toward what he called “an era of strangled investments” despite billions in government subsidies.

“In my judgment it’s not a cost, it’s an investment,” he explained. “Any efforts with regard to retraining or going into new areas of renewables can only be good, both from an economic point of view, and an environmental point of view.

“More and more banks and other institutions are switching towards renewable areas for their future energy development, and in the last three or four years major companies are pulling out of the oilsands. That trend is taking place everywhere.”

The original Pact for a Green New Deal has been championed by some Democrats south of the border, including Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been a lightning rod for conservatives.

The plan takes its title from U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt’s 1930s New Deal legislation, which lifted the country from the Great Depression through massive public works projects, employment programs and stricter financial controls.

While Canada’s version will undoubtedly be controversial, many appear sympathetic to the ideas behind it. A poll last month by Abacus Data found that 61 per cent of the survey’s 1,000 respondents said they either support or somewhat support such a proposal, described as “a massive government jobs program and investment in clean energy, green technology, and electrification.”

In another Abacus Data poll released Friday, 87 per cent of 15-to-30-year-olds said “solving climate change” was a serious issue — four-in-10 “extremely serious.”

The May 2 survey of 1,000 young people found the concern about the issue was “consistent across age, gender, education and income.” But the survey also found that six in 10 young people believe they “don’t have a say in what the government does,” 18 per cent of them believing that strongly. The older the youth, Abacus found, the “much more likely to feel disenfranchised.” (The survey used online panels and had a margin of error equivalent to 3.1 per cent).

Still, the deal might well be dismissed by politicians or many Canadians.

That’s what happened with Canada’s earlier Leap Manifesto. Backed by prominent activists and academics — and debated, though not adopted by the federal NDP due to intense internal divisions — it was one of the most controversial environmental proposals in the past decade and called for a complete revolution in Canada’s economy away from fossil fuels. The Leap Manifesto website has endorsed the proposed Green New Deal.

More than its American namesake, the Canadian deal’s bigger inspiration is Quebec’s Le Pacte, organizers said — a manifesto which has gathered 270,000 signatures to date. Le Pacte calls for a 50 per cent emissions cut by 2030, and requiring that all levels of government legislation pass a “test of their climate impacts.”

Even in some resource-dependent ridings of B.C., the “green new deal” catchphrase has seen buy-in from politicians. For instance, after Revelstoke, B.C., saw students join climate protests, Kootenay-Columbia MP Wayne Stetski, with the NDP, praised the youth’s message.

“We need a bold plan that reduces emissions while creating sustainable jobs for workers,” Stetski said on Friday in the House of Commons. “We can do this by committing to renewable energy, retrofitting homes, expanding public transit and investing in clean manufacturing.”

According to analysis of Hansard debate transcripts by the Star Vancouver, so far this year the phrases “climate change,” “greenhouse gases” or “global warming” have been uttered in the House of Commons by 103 members of Parliament, half of them Liberals, and nearly one-third by New Democrats.

By contrast, just 15 Conservative MPs have uttered any of those phrases this year so far — but over the same four months four times that amount, 60 Tory lawmakers, used the words “carbon tax.” (Three New Democrats and the Greens’ Elizabeth May used the phrase, but Liberals entirely avoided it).

The only MPs who have spoken of a “green new deal” in Parliament have been three from the NDP. May unsurprisingly joined the call for such a “transformative” plan.

The federal Liberal government maintains Canada will meet its target under the Paris Agreement to fight climate change, which is to reduce national emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. As of 2017, Canada’s emissions were two per cent below what they were in 2005, according to the national tally submitted this week to the United Nations.

To close that gap, Ottawa enforced a minimum carbon price across the country this year, which will rise from $20 per tonne of emissions to $50 per tonne in 2022. The federal government is also phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2030, when it aims for 90 per cent of electricity in Canada to come from emissions-free sources.

At the same time, the Liberal government has earmarked millions for green technology and infrastructure.

Earlier this month, federal scientists released a report that said Canada is warming at twice the global average because of climate change, and that action to reduce emissions can only mitigate the severity of the consequences, which are likely to include disappearing Arctic ice and permafrost, rising sea levels in coastal cities and more frequent floods, heat waves, summer water shortages and wildfires.

For Jimenez, who is originally from Mexico, climate change is more than an environmental issue, but one that will cause devastating damage to the world’s economy, harming the poor in the Southern Hemisphere the most.

“The effects of climate change don’t care if you can vote or not,” she said. “This election is so critical, because if we are to meet the target of cutting carbon emissions by half in 11 years, the people in power for the next four years will be in charge when that needs to happen.

“This election could be our last chance. Otherwise we won’t make it. We need to make sure it happens.”

You can replace pastafarisim doctrines with any religion you get same  results",4.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Djemila Benhabib, representing the Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité, said Tuesday that some Muslim women who wear the hijab are 'fundamentalists.' (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-philpott-federal-election-1.5149284,Green party?,7.0,41.0,"Former Liberal cabinet members Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott say they will make announcements Monday about their political futures.

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."

Bernier has so far failed to parlay the significant political capital he had accumulated as a CPC leadership front-runner into a lasting electoral down payment for his People’s Party. If anything, he has depleted that capital.

Two years ago, one in two Conservative members supported Bernier’s bid to succeed Stephen Harper. For 12 of the 13 ballots it took to declare a winner, the leadership was his to lose.

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

“It felt like somebody was taking a sword and jamming it between my legs and on the right side of my stomach,” the 36-year old Brampton, Ont., man told Global News over the phone.

By March, Fitzsimmons had been forced to leave his job as an assembly-plant quality monitor, which requires heavy lifting. By May, medical tests had confirmed a diagnosis of intestinal cancer. And by July 2016, his workplace disability benefits had kicked in, providing a monthly income that Fitzsimmons said was just under $2,000.

But in March 2018 Fitzsimmons was informed his benefits would be terminated as of July of that year, even while he was still undergoing daily chemotherapy treatment.

In correspondence reviewed by Global News, Manulife, the group disability insurance provider at Fitzsimmons’ workplace, said he no longer qualified for the benefit because his illness did not prevent him from performing less physically strenuous jobs, like data-entry clerk or information services representative, that he might be able to get with his professional and educational background.

The termination of benefits left Fitzsimmons with only around $1,000 in monthly income from his Canada Pension Plan disability benefit, a situation he described as being under financial “house arrest.”

“I can’t go anywhere. I literally have to plan every move that I make because that’s how impoverished I’m living right now,” he told Global News.

Manulife rejected two appeals by Fitzsimmons in which he provided additional evidence to sustain his claim that severe side effects from the chemo treatments rendered him unable to work. The documents included a letter from his oncologist at Toronto’s Mt. Sinai Hospital, which described “severe” symptoms including nausea; dizziness; fatigue; sharp, shooting abdominal pains; loose and irritable bowels and headaches, among others.

Due to those side effects, Fitzsimmons was “unable to (perform) any kind labour of any kind,” the letter reads (emphasis in the original document).

In a document citing that letter, Manulife wrote that its own medical consultant had advised that Fitzsimmons may be able to achieve some degree of symptom relief with drugs like Gravol, Imodium or Nabilone.

But doctors never told him to take such over-the-counter medications, Fitzsimmons’ lawyer, Nainesh Kotak, told Global News.

In March, shortly after receiving his second appeal denial, Fitzsimmons hired Kotak and filed a lawsuit against Manulife with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

On May 9, one day after Global News contacted the company about the case, Manulife said it would reinstate his disability benefits dating back to March 2018, according to Kotak.

“We are very empathetic to Mr. Fitzsimmons’ situation and are sorry for what he has experienced,” Manulife said in an emailed statement to Global News.

“We strive to do everything within our power to satisfy our customers and were already in the process of reviewing and responding to this complex matter. We have been in contact with Mr. Fitzsimmons’ lawyer to work on this together,” the company also said.

Group disability benefits and the critical two-year mark

Fitzsimmons’ story highlights a common issue with workplace disability benefits, Kotak said, speaking before Manulife announced the resumption of benefits.

Story continues below advertisement

Often, eligibility for group disability benefits is subject to two tests. The first, which is administered when the worker first claims disability, is aimed at verifying whether she or he has become unable to perform her or his regular job, something known as “regular-occupation test” or “own-occupation test.”

READ MORE: The CRA makes it so hard to get the disability tax credit, many don’t even try

But after a period of time, usually two to five years, the criteria for eligibility become more stringent. Workers are only allowed to maintain their benefits if they are deemed unable to perform any job for which they may be qualified given their skills and experience, something called “any-occupation test.”

The second test is the one Fitzsimmons failed, despite the fact that he’d been approved for CPP disability, which the government defines as a benefit available to contributors who “are disabled and cannot work at any job on a regular basis.”

In correspondence with Fitzsimmons, Manulife said eligibility for his group disability benefits beyond the two-year mark was restricted to those unable to perform “any occupation for which the employee is qualified or may be reasonably become qualified by training, education or experience.”

The insurer acknowledged that Fitzsimmons had started to receive CPP disability benefits but told him that “CPP requirements for eligibility differ from the contractual provisions of your group policy.”

While Fitzsimmons’ case “raises eyebrows,” the any-occupation test is a common reason why workers lose their employer disability benefits, Kotak said.

How private disability coverage can supplement group benefits

The need to supplement work disability benefits with private insurance is becoming an increasingly important issue, not just due to the dreaded two-year mark but also because employers, under pressure to cut costs, are becoming less and less generous with their group disabilities policies, according to personal finance expert Preet Banerjee.

A couple of decades ago, Banerjee said, it was standard for companies to offer disability coverage until age 65. Today, he added, it’s more common to see the maximum length of this benefit limited to much shorter periods, like 10 or five years.

Employees, Banerjee said, aren’t always aware of this.

“They’ll just say: ‘Oh, do they offer disability coverage or not?’ And they don’t really take a look at what is the nature of that coverage,” he told Global News.

Individual policies can be pricey, but they’re usually well worth the money, Banerjee argues. People, he noted, are much more likely to become at least temporarily disabled during their working lives than they are of dying prematurely.

According to Statistics Canada, working-age Canadians have a one-in-three chance of developing a disability that will last for more than three months.

And disability coverage could amount to a lot of money for someone who becomes disabled right at the beginning of their working life, Banerjee noted.

“Multiply (your annual income) for by a 40-year career, and you’re looking at millions of dollars,” he said.

But precisely because the chance of disability and the potential payouts tend to be high, private disability insurance is pricey.

For example, a 30-year old female non-smoker making $65,000 working in HR may pay something like $120 a month for a private LTD plan that kicks in after 90 days and pays out $3,500 a month, or 65 per cent of employment income, according to a quote provided to Global News by Lorne Marr, director of business development at LSM Insurance, an independent life insurance broker.

What to look for in a disability insurance policy

When advising clients about disability insurance, financial adviser Liz Schieck recommends clients choose regular- or own-occupation versus any-occupation as an eligibility criterion, as well as partial-disability as opposed to just total-disability coverage.

Story continues below advertisement

If you’re going to pay for it, you might as well choose a policy that’s more likely to actually result in a payout, she reckons.

READ MORE: Worried about outliving your retirement savings? There’s insurance for that

Regular-occupation coverage usually means you’ll be deemed eligible to receive payments if you can’t work in the job you had when you became disabled. Own-occupation coverage is even more generous and will pay out the full benefit even if your disability allows you to work in a different position. Banerjee offered the example of a surgeon who injured his hands. With own-occupation coverage, the doctor would be able to continue to receive 100 per cent of the payments even if she or he started, say, teaching at university.

Own-occupation coverage, which is more expensive, usually makes sense for high earners and people working in jobs that require very specific and not easily transferable skills, Schieck said.

Partial-disability coverage, on the other hand, guarantees that you’ll get some money, usually up to 50 per cent of the benefit, even if you are still able to perform some of your professional duties.

How to get private LTD insurance without breaking the bank

For Canadians with work disability benefits, one way to keep costs in check is to choose an individual policy that will only take effect when the criteria for workplace coverage switch to the more stringent any-occupation test, Banerjee said.

For example, take the woman in our earlier scenario — let’s call her Susie. Her monthly premium would decrease to $97 if she changed her so-called elimination period from 90 days to two years, according to Marr.

If that was still too much for Susie, she could further lower her monthly premium by reducing the amount of her benefit from 65 per cent of her pay to 50 per cent. That would bring the monthly cost of her policy down to $77 a month.

Of course, the catch is that Susie’s full benefit would also shrink from $3,500 to around $2,700 a month. But that isn’t as bad it may seem, Marr noted. The benefits aren’t subject to tax so a benefit that covers 65 per cent of gross salary will come quite close to someone’s after-tax income. A 50 per cent payout means Susie would get a bit less than that but still more than half of her take-home pay.

Banerjee recommended trimming back the payout amount rather than limiting the length of the coverage to anything less than the time you turn 65. And Schieck said a lower payout is also preferable to choosing stricter policies that apply the any-occupation or total-disability tests.

As for Fitzsimmons, he had actually taken a good look at his workplace disability benefits well before he had an inkling that he had cancer, he told Global News.

If he could what is stopping a land developer?,6.0,21.0,"As the Ottawa River begins to recede after bursting its banks for the second time in two years, politicians are beginning to ask whether it makes sense to allow residents to rebuild in flood-prone areas.

""The federal government and the provinces and municipalities need to think through very carefully how we prevent ourselves from simply doing the same old thing over and over and over again, and expecting a different result,"" Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters earlier this week after touring flooded areas of Ottawa and Clarence-Rockland.

Federal and provincial ministers responsible for emergency management have been discussing the growing cost of natural disasters, and how to build infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather, Goodale said.

Quebec's premier has also opened the discussion about offering homeowners financial incentives to move.

François Legault said his government would compensate homeowners in neighbourhoods such as Pointe-Gatineau up to $100,000 for flood damage, but $200,000 to move to higher, dryer ground.

Could the federal government offer similar incentives?

""We're not taking anything off the table at this stage,"" Goodale said.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says all levels of government are responsible for managing flood plains, though Mayor Jim Watson said the City of Ottawa couldn't afford to offer buyouts to residents. 1:02

The case for buyouts

Buyouts should be ""an essential part of the toolkit"" for managing flood risk, according to Daniel Henstra, a political science professor at the University of Waterloo who studies climate change adaptation and emergency management policies.

""The upfront cost of a buyout program, although high, is undoubtedly less than the long-term costs of repeatedly rebuilding properties in high-risk areas when we know they're going to flood again,"" Henstra told Ottawa Morning.

Henstra said the voluntary buyout Quebec is offering is a good start.

""For many people ... the offer probably won't be enough to cover their mortgage. But I do suspect that many who have been flooded multiple times would jump at the opportunity.""

Mayor Jim Watson and Coun. Eli El-Chantiry say some residents of west Ottawa communities hit hard by two floods and a tornado in the last two years are thinking of leaving the area. 1:06

Alberta offered similar voluntary buyouts after the extensive flooding in 2013, and Henstra said about one-third of eligible homeowners took the province up on the offer.

For those unwilling to leave, Henstra said governments will need to have ""tough conversations"" about the conditions under which they're allowed to stay.

We're human. I keep saying my community is the most resilient, but at some point it's a little bit too much. - Coun . Eli El-Chantiry

Instead, Watson said such a buyout would have to come from the Ontario government.

""If this is going to happen every couple of years, it's extremely stressful on the families and it's very expensive for governments,"" Watson said while surveying the flood damage in Fitzroy Harbour earlier this week.

John Yakabuski, the MPP for Renfew–Nipissing–Pembroke, said those discussions will happen.

""I think there will be a good opportunity when this disaster has been dealt with,"" Yakabuski told Ottawa Morning.

Local rules

In Ottawa, developers aren't allowed to build within the boundaries of a one-in-100-year flood plain, which are mapped by local conservation authorities.

The story is different for existing homes, which would typically have to be rebuilt on the same footprint, in the same location. Residents affected by the 2017 floods were given special permission to rebuild in such a way that their homes would be safer from future flooding.

Now, after the second flood in two years and last fall's destructive tornadoes, some west end homeowners are wondering if they should bother trying again.

Their councillor, Eli El-Chantiry, said some residents have had enough.

Premier Bob McLeod is laying out a vision for the North's future that includes an increased military presence and major development of Arctic waters for transportation.

""We need to position Canada's North as a central international transport hub for the future of the Arctic and we see significant more infrastructure investment required,"" McLeod said in a recent interview with CBC Politics in Ottawa.

McLeod said he'll be presenting this and other ideas to the federal government in Ottawa within the next month.

The premier wants Canada to triple its icebreaker fleet within five years and triple its deepwater port capacity within 10 years.

""I think that you see other Arctic countries becoming significant players in the Arctic and we need to be sure that Canada and the North is ready for when that happens,"" McLeod said.

Both China and Russia have shown growing interest in the Arctic. The Barents Observer of Norway reported in February that Russia plans to use supersonic jet fighters to make regular patrols of the North Pole, something Russia hasn't done since the Cold War.

McLeod said Inuvik, located 100 kilometres from the Beaufort Sea, should play a key security role.

""We'd like to see a full military base, preferably in Inuvik, of about 5,000 permanent personnel,"" he said.

While the federal government announced last fall that Yellowknife will be home to a new Arctic Region Coast Guard base, McLeod said there should be a base in the Beaufort Sea.

Officials from all three northern territories are meeting in Yellowknife on Wednesday. The Arctic Security Working Group will discuss safety, security and defence issues, along with the commander of the Canadian Forces' Joint Task Force North.

It's unknown whether McLeod's vision of a more militarized North will be part of the federal government's much-anticipated Arctic Policy Framework, which may be released as early as June.

The new Arctic policy initiative was announced in December 2016 to replace the 2009 Northern Strategy and the 2010 Statement on Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy under Stephen Harper's Conservative government.

The current federal government recently added foreign affairs and national security, as well as reconciliation, to the list of themes the new policy will address.

""We've been working with the government of Canada on a 10-year vision and plan for Arctic Canada and I've been going to a lot of Arctic conferences and realizing that Canada is falling way far behind the other Arctic countries,"" McLeod said.

""So we're coming up with a plan where the Arctic will become a critical international arena of economics, science and infrastructure and environment strategy.""

Icebreaker U

In order to increase understanding of the Arctic, McLeod envisions a Canada-wide civil service rotation program in which senior bureaucrats from the South spend time living in the North. He'd also like to see a federal department of Arctic affairs and a northern immigration program.

""We think that we need more immigration and the fact is we don't have enough people up here. We're also looking at having a permanent offshore Arctic university school on one of the existing icebreakers,"" he said.

McLeod said he takes climate change and Arctic ecology ""very, very seriously."" His vision for the N.W.T., however, remains steeped in fostering transportation corridors and pipelines to accommodate the oil and gas industry.

McLeod says innovation is needed to find alternate energy sources for 20 diesel-dependent communities beyond solar and wind, given that neither of those can supply continuous, year-round power to communities.

McLeod has been premier of the N.W.T. since 2011. He is the MLA for the riding of Yellowknife South. The next territorial election is Oct. 1."

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says a gun smuggling 'pipeline' moves firearms across the border from the U.S. into Canada illegally. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Wes Winkel, is the owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to pick out a possible straw buyer, and law enforcement authorities have been slow to identify them based on sales records. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

(The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

More on that next week."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-senate-resolution-charter-1.5128399,"I have no love for China. But the minute Trump opened his yap, this case should have ended.",4.0,73.0,"The United States Senate has passed a resolution praising the Canadian government for the way it has conducted itself in the case of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

The resolution commends ""the government of Canada for upholding the rule of law and expressing concern over actions by the government of the People's Republic of China in response to a request from the United States government to the government of Canada for the extradition of a Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. executive.""

The resolution is nonbinding and is considered an expression of the Senate's will on the issue.

Canada has face widespread political and economic pressure from China since Meng's arrest in December and has been looking to its international allies for diplomatic assistance.

In February, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland met with U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, to ask for American help in its ongoing tussle with China over Meng's arrest. Risch ultimately introduced the Senate resolution.

Since Meng's arrest, China has placed a number of trade hurdles in front of Canadian exporters — banning imports from two canola producers, tying up shipments over paperwork and putting unusual obstacles in the way of Canadian soybean and pea exporters.

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December after Canadian officials detained Meng in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S. She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.

In March, China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him by Spavor.

'Arbitrary detention'

In December, a few months before that accusation was made, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Kovrig and Spavor were being unlawfully detained and should be returned to Canada.

That position was affirmed by the Senate Tuesday in a resolution that expressed concern over China's ""apparent arbitrary detention and abusive treatment of Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in apparent retaliation for the government of Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou.""

One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial in January. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling. Last month, a Chinese court sentenced another Canadian, Fan Wei, to death for participating in a global methamphetamine operation.

Meng's Charter of Rights defence

The resolution landed as Meng's defence team said it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the U.S. because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest at Vancouver's airport was unlawful.

Benjamin Howes, a spokesman for Huawei Canada, told reporters in Vancouver Wednesday that Meng's legal team will also argue that her rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated during her arrest.

""Ms. Meng intends to apply to the court for a stay of the extradition proceedings. Canadians value the rule of law and the Charter of Rights,"" he said.

""We have trust in the Canadian legal process and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored.""

According to the federal government's guide to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ""any person in Canada – whether they are a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident or a newcomer – has the rights and freedoms contained in the Charter.""

Seeking more documents

During a hearing Wednesday, Crown prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley, who is representing the Attorney General of Canada, asked Justice Heather Holmes to see that Meng's case proceeds as quickly as possible, proposing a first court date by the end of August.

He said the allegations against Meng centre on a misrepresentation she is alleged to have made to a bank that put the institution's economic interests at risk, adding it's not yet time to make arguments in the case.

The defence said it needs more time to gather documents through freedom of information requests. It also wants audio from Meng's questioning at the time of her arrest, which already has been described as unlawful in a civil suit."

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

Story continues below advertisement

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

This is revolting! Once again some cult figure escapes justice.",38.0,63.0,"A former German teacher in a southern Alberta Hutterite community who terrorized and abused children for more than a decade has pleaded guilty to seven counts of assault with a weapon.

Johan Hofer, 48, admitted to beating children in the Waterton Hutterite Colony and in his class with straps, tree branches — and in one case, burning them with a lighter to show them how hot hell would be.

Judge Derek Redman of the Provincial Court of Alberta imposed a two-year conditional sentence order, meaning Hofer will serve his sentence in the community under conditions that include house arrest for 12 months and a curfew for the remaining year.

Because of the abuse they suffered between 2002 and 2013, several children left the colony at Hill Spring, Alta. — some 70 kilometres southwest from Lethbridge — before their 18th birthdays to get away from Hofer, according to the facts read aloud by the prosecutor.

Dozens of male ministers from Hutterite colonies across the Prairies showed up in court, filling the room.

When asked their opinions on Hofer staying in the community, one elder from Waterton said the case has been ""very, very emotional for the colony and for the church.""

If he causes no arguments, ""it will be for the good to come together as one family to serve our heavenly father,"" said the elder.

Whipped, humiliated

Since the charges were laid, many of the victims' families have been ostracized from the community, according to prosecutor Darwyn Ross.

Hofer was to go on trial this week on 14 counts of assault with a weapon but pleaded to half the counts instead.

The court heard Tuesday what some of the victims endured.

In several cases, Hofer would have children kneel on the hard tile for the duration of his class. Often he would have his victims — who ranged in ages from six to 14 — bend over a stool and would whip them with a leather strap in front of their classmates.

The children described feeling not only intense physical pain but also humiliation.

""Most days I was afraid to leave the house,"" wrote one of Hofer's victims in an impact statement.

The boy, whose identity is protected by a publication ban, said his days always ended in tears and he felt as though he had nowhere to hide.

'Did not intend to hurt the children'

One girl said the pain was often a 10 out of 10 after Hofer hit her hands and backside with a belt, tree branches and yardsticks.

Another victim described being hit in the side with a stick so hard he bled through his shirt. The boy was guilty, in Hofer's opinion, of failing to write out his German verses quickly enough.

Redman asked the lawyers involved if Hofer simply ""went way too far"" in his effort to discipline.

Defence lawyer Adriano Iovinelli agreed with the judge's suggestion.

""My client did not intend to hurt the children,"" said Iovinelli. ""The intent was for the discipline.""

Iovinelli compared his client's actions to old-school corporal punishment, which the senior defence lawyer said even he suffered as a child."

Harold Verge, 72, is blind. His wife also suffers from a series of debilitating health issues. Last month, they lost the home they owned for the past 24 years when it was sold, against their will, they say.

The agent, Vince Iannello, while not denying any of the specific allegations, says he has ""never wavered"" from caring for his clients. For its part, Royal LePage says it is investigating the Verges' case.

But the Verges say their ordeal began when Iannello, a realtor with Royal LePage Your Community Realty in Vaughan, offered to help the couple renew their two mortgages, according to Verge.

""When my wife was trying to read the paperwork, he kept saying, 'Don't read it, sign it, sign it,'"" Verge recalled Iannello telling her.

""We thought we were only signing to renew our mortgages.""

Days after the mortgages were renewed, the Verges say Iannello returned to their home and told them it was going to be sold. CBC News has reviewed the mortgage renewal documents, both in the Verges' home and at their lawyer's office.

""He said he's going to sell our house whether we like it or not, because we're not allowed to own our house after you're 65 years old,"" Verge said.

""He said he had to do his part to sell it.""

There are no laws in Canada preventing seniors from owning property.

""I think he tricked us into it. My wife feels the same way. He tricked us,"" Verge said about listing the home for sale.

Iannello also allegedly told the couple his wife had just given birth to a third child, and that the realtor needed money, according to Verge.

Last month, the Verges moved into a small rented bungalow several kilometres away after their home was sold.

""I wake up in the middle of the night tormented and in fear,"" Verge told CBC News.

""What's going to happen next?"" he said, pointing to stacks of boxes piled high in the living room of the rented bungalow.

""I'm afraid if I unpack everything, and the landlord says you have to get out, you have to move, we've got to worry about packing and moving again,"" he said.

Iannello paid their first and last months' rent once their home was sold.

Vince Iannello is a real estate agent with Royal LePage Your Community In brokerage.

'They were fooled,' lawyer says

Verge and his wife Florence bought their 2.5-storey, semi-detached home at 42 Connaught Ave, in the Queen Street East and Greenwood Avenue area, in 1995.

The couple was in good standing financially, despite their modest incomes and their two mortgages.

Harold Verge weaves cane to repair seats and backrests on antique chairs. Florence Verge retired after working 30 years at a McDonald's restaurant.

Iannello declined to answer numerous questions from CBC News. In an emailed statement he said he wasn't able to due to legal reasons.

""I was surprised to be contacted by the CBC regarding these allegations,"" he wrote.

Commitment to Verges 'is genuine,' Iannello says

""My commitment to the Verges is genuine and I am disappointed that no further details can be provided by me at this time due to the potential for litigation,"" his email reads.

The Verges, with the help of a concerned friend, have since hired a lawyer to look into the situation.

""They were fooled,"" Charles Wagman, the Verges' lawyer, told CBC News.

""There was pressure because of the idea they had to sell, that they weren't entitled at law to own property anymore. That's what the Verges say motivated them to sell.""

Wagman says the home was also sold for below market value.

""It appears the property was grossly undersold.""

In a complaint to the brokerage, Wagman accuses Iannello of negligence, noting the realtor didn't list the Verges' home on the Multiple Listing Service. The website is widely used by realtors to list homes for sale and attract a larger pool of potential buyers.

Instead, Iannello sent an email to other agents at the Royal LePage Your Community Realty brokerage letting them know the Verge's home was available.

CBC News obtained a copy of the email. In it, Iannello claimed the Verges were ""motivated sellers.""

""They were the opposite of motivated sellers. They didn't want to sell,"" said Wagman.

House sold for less than any other on the street recently

Nine days after being listed, the Verges' home was sold with the help of one of Iannello's colleagues at Royal LePage Your Community Realty.

Realtor Leslie-Jane Patterson's clients bought the Verges' home for $675 000.

In an email that Patterson wrote to another potential buyer, she noted the home had been appraised at $750 000. She described the home as being in ""rough shape"" but added it had upgraded hydro service, water systems and a newer furnace.

Patterson described the Verges' home as an ""opportunity"" and told her client, two other 2.5 storey, semi-detached homes on the same street recently sold for $880 000 and $886 000 each.

""I have zero vested interest in this property other than helping these poor souls that appear to be being taken advantage of. I had no idea of the situation when I took my investors through the property today — if anything I was told not to engage in conversing with the vendor, oops!!!"" she wrote in the email.

It's not clear who Patterson believed was taking advantage of the Verges.

She declined to respond to specific questions from CBC News, and hung up when reached by phone.

In a later email to CBC News, she provided no specifics about the situation.

""Nothing brings me more joy than helping my clients successfully navigate their home sales and purchases. I take great pride and care in my work. I respect the privacy of my clients and it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any additional manner,"" she wrote.

Patterson, Iannello and the brokerage pocketed more than $33 000 in commissions from the sale.

In his email, Iannello suggested he did nothing wrong.

""I have never wavered from always caring about the well being of my clients. Until this is resolved, I will not have an opportunity to discuss this further,"" he wrote.

'Looking into the details' of Verges' case, Royal LePage says

Representatives from Royal LePage's corporate head office also declined to answer any specific questions about the home sale.

In an emailed statement, the company's director of communications suggested the matter is being investigated.

""Royal LePage's brand is built on integrity, a strong commitment to the community and the best interests of consumers,"" Sarah Louise Gardiner wrote.

""Our brokerages are independently owned and operated and we are looking into the details of this specific situation. We cannot discuss it further at this time.""

Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

READ MORE: Atlantic Canada clean energy collaboration receives $2M federal investment

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

Used fuel from the Bruce Power plant is stored in the form of pellets that fit into tubes. These tubes are collected into bundles and packed into carbon steel tubes coated in copper. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository. If so, it seems like one more question may arise in the years ahead: does it really makes sense to build two?"

The Calgary-based company is now to be called TC Energy Corp., after shareholders approved the change at its annual meeting Friday.

""The name TC Energy acknowledges our origin as TransCanada PipeLines, while adding the word 'energy' speaks to the breadth of our business, which includes pipelines, power generation and energy storage,"" Girling told the meeting.

""But to be clear, this is a name change, not a brand name. We are very proud of who we are and what we do.""

He declined to talk to reporters after the event.

The company said the change recognizes its growth into the United States and Mexico, including through its recent $13-billion US purchase of U.S. natural gas transporter Columbia Pipeline Group.

It has about 7,000 employees in North America, with 3,500 in Canada, 3,200 in the U.S. and 300 in Mexico.

But some analysts suggest it's also a chance to distance itself from Canada, where difficulty in getting pipeline projects approved has been blamed for a glut of oil that caused steep discount pricing last fall and prompted the Alberta government to curtail production starting in January.

""I think the name change is semantics,"" U.S.-based analyst Jennifer Rowland of Edward Jones wrote in an email.

""I don't think it attracts new investors, but I do think it's a subtle, or not so subtle depending on how you view it, way to de-emphasize Canada as some investors are leery of investing in Canada given the government intervention in free markets in Alberta and the difficult regulatory environment for energy.""

TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta into the U.S. was first proposed in 2008, rejected by then-president Barack Obama in 2015, approved by President Donald Trump in 2016 and again in March, but remains on hold awaiting court rulings in Montana and Nebraska.

The court delays mean the project will not be able to start construction in the U.S. this year, Paul Miller, president of liquids pipelines, confirmed during an afternoon conference call with financial analysts.

The project could still be unfinished if a new federal government is elected in the U.S. in 2020, he added, but it's hoped all permits and approvals will be in hand by then and a new administration won't affect bringing the project on stream.

Shareholders at the meeting voted almost 90 per cent against a motion sponsored by the Pension Plan of the United Church of Canada that would have required the company to report on how it is meeting international standards for Indigenous people's rights.

They went along with the company's recommendation to reject the motion as unnecessary given its existing policies.

The official approval of the name change came as the company reported a first-quarter profit of $1 billion of $1.09 per share, up from $734 million or 83 cents per share a year ago.

Revenue for the first quarter totalled $3.49 billion, compared with $3.42 billion in the first quarter of 2018.

On a comparable basis, TransCanada says it earned $987 million or $1.07 per share for the quarter, up from $864 million or 98 cents per share a year ago.

Analysts on average had expected a profit of 99 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon."

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

We need to stop electing people on their promises and elect them on their integrity instead.

Why? Because policies mean nothing without integrity",31.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

The Mounties released a statement last week defending their handling of the case and — as late as Monday — had turned aside further requests for comment."

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is defending a decision to give a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservative Party a role in determining which news organizations are eligible for government funding.

Eight Canadian organizations will select representatives to sit on an advisory panel that will decide how the government should dole out $600-million media support fund, the government announced Wednesday.

They are News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

Unifor — a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservatives under both Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer — represents more than 12,000 journalists and media workers in Canada.

In a statement posted to Facebook, Unifor said critics are mischaracterizing its role on the panel. The union says it will help define the criteria through which the funds will be allocated, but won't be directly involved in deciding who gets the money.

""There is a lot at stake as we work to protect and preserve our news industry in Canada and after years of discussion we finally have a path forward,"" the union said.

As It Happens has reached out to Unifor for comment.

Rodriguez spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the new panel. Here is part of their conversation.

I don't know if you had a chance to read Chris Selley at the National Post ... who says that that your putting Unifor on this panel is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. How do you respond?

We chose different organizations that represent journalists and different media across the country with different regions being represented, both official languages, the ethnic press.

We wanted to make sure that it was representative of the industry, and that's the reason why they're all there.

Why Unifor?

It represents thousands of employees from the news sector.

But it also represents a very, very strong bias, doesn't it? Because Unifor has made it quite clear that they call themselves ""the resistance."" They have put out publicity. I'm sure you've seen their publicity: ""The resistance: Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" If you want to have a panel that appears to be unbiased, how does that help you?

This is Andrew Scheer's opinion, and ...

Excuse me. No, no. This is not Andrew Scheer's opinion. I'm looking at a picture put out. This is Unifor Canada's picture.

We're talking about professionals, which is the case of all the groups there are on this list.

And the reason why we wanted to intervene is because professional journalism is one of the pillars of democracy. And the Conservatives may think that, ""Well, you know what? We shouldn't do anything and then let them all die.""

On the contrary, we're saying, ""No, we have to be there to support them with one clear principle — to respect the freedom and independence of the press.""

Unifor posted this image in a November 2018 tweet that read: 'Unifor’s National Executive Board started planning for the federal election today @AndrewScheer #canlab #canpoli.' (@UniforTheUnion/Twitter)

That's not the issue here. The issue is that you said you were going to put together a panel, an advisory panel, to decide who is going to get the funds, the $600 million worth of support to the media in this country, and that you would have an unbiased and an independent panel.

Yes, which is the case.

Mr. Rodriguez, have you not seen the publicity that Unifor is putting out calling themselves ""the resistance"" and saying, ""Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" Have you not seen that?

I know what you're talking about.

The Conservatives are saying that Unifor, any people working or any journalists, can be bought by this program, which is not the case, and I think it's an insult to professional journalists that build their career on integrity and on independence and on professionalism.

We're talking about the people on the panel. We're not talking about the journalists who might be benefiting from these funds. We saw that Unifor, it was quite partisan during the 2015 election campaign, that they put out attack ads against Stephen Harper's Conservatives, which surely helped you get elected. So, again, we're back to this problem of an appearance of bias. That if you have, if you are giving this position to Unifor, to the union, to decide who is going to get this funding, when it's an organization that has clearly come out ... going against your political enemies, that's a problem, isn't it?

This is repeating what Andrew Scheer is saying. And, again, I have to disagree with you, because if you look at the role the associations are playing, the role ... the journalists are playing, they're there to ask the tough questions — just exactly like what you're doing.

And also, this proves my point that we need that type of journalism of tough questions. And maybe the Conservatives, they don't want to hear those questions, but I think they're absolutely necessary in our democracy. So that's why the panel is in place. That's why we're moving forward.

But you've asked this panel to help decide who is a proper journalist and what's a proper news outlet and who is worthy of these funds. And who you've put on the panel that gets to decide that an organization that has a very, very strong, very partisan political statement.

But you keep repeating the same thing.

Because I'm not getting a very good answer from you.

I am answering your question and I'm saying that it's a panel with different people there from different sides of the industry, all representing professional journalists.

I guess what I'm trying to get to ... is that you want people to trust this fund, and Canadians want journalism they can trust. They want to believe that it's unbiased. But if the critics of your fund have always raised the alarm about any possible bias, that's why you wanted to have an independent panel. But haven't you just walked into that trap?

No, these panels represent people from all sides of industry. It represents work as a journalist, it represents the owners, it represents francophones, anglophones, the different regions, the ethnic media. It represents everybody.

And you don't think that there is a bias here, or a perception of bias, if you have as one of your panel members — and I know I'm asking you this once again, and I apologize for that, but I still haven't got a clear answer — do you not think that this is a problem of bias?

But I did answer your question.

You don't think that there's any bias on the part of Unifor, that Unifor doesn't have a political agenda?

No, you're saying that the journalists they represent have their own agenda.

No, no, I'm not saying that.

Yes, you're saying that.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm not. The panel you put together has Unifor as one of its members. And the question is that an organization that is clearly partisan and anti-Conservative, and have made that very clear, we're asking if that's an appropriate party to have on this panel?

We're saying that we need people from all walks of life. In this case ... people that represent the workers, the employers, the regions, the official languages and all of that to be represented there to make sure that this panel represents all of them, and that it takes neutral decisions on professional journalism.

Because we need professional journalism in our society. You're there to ask the tough questions. Again, that's exactly what you're doing and this is what we need.

JWR should be fine.",11.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

On Friday, police executed a search warrant at a home on Larratt Lane, near Bathurst Street and Elgin Mills Road West, and discovered explosive materials. Police did not specify what exactly the materials were or how much was removed. They said chemicals were also seized.

Ontario Provincial Police, along with the York police's explosives detection unit, helped to removed the materials.

As a precaution, police practically shut down the street on Friday, forcing neighbours from their homes and restricting vehicle and pedestrian traffic as officers carried out their work. Neighbours have since been allowed back into their homes, police said.

Despite, evacuation orders being lifted and the suburban street returning to normal, residents say they have been left feeling uneasy.

In a news release on Tuesday, police said dangerous chemicals being stored in a home can pose serious risks, including fires and explosions.

They urged members of public to call police if they see any suspicious activity, notice chemical odours, or unusual storage or stockpiling of chemicals and to take precautions.

Provincial officials have told the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine (OIRM) that its $5 million in annual funding from the province will cease next March.

The Toronto-based institute provides grants to help Ontario researchers turn their their stem cell discoveries into treatments that are both medically and commercially viable.

The government's decision to terminate the funding is ""extremely short-sighted and uninformed,"" said Bernard Thébaud, a neonatal researcher who received funding from OIRM to explore the use of stem cells in preventing complications from premature birth.

""If [the government] would do a careful analysis, they would realize this is a worthwhile investment,"" said Thébaud, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and professor of pediatrics at the University of Ottawa.

His work has shown that stem cells isolated from the umbilical cord have the potential to prevent brain and lung damage in premature babies and promote healthy development of the organs as the children age.

""We believe this [research] could be a game-changer for these pre-term babies and could substantially improve their outcomes,"" Thébaud said Wednesday in an interview.

The funding to OIRM came from Ontario's Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. The minister responsible, Todd Smith, said the researchers can turn to the private sector.

""The previous government was throwing millions of dollars around like crazy and they were not holding anyone accountable as to how they were spending that money,"" Smith told reporters Wednesday at Queen's Park.

""What we've heard from the life-sciences sector is that a lot of these organizations don't actually need government money, that the private sector will step up,"" said Smith.

But scientists in the stem-cell field say the private sector is not willing to invest until their studies reach a late phase. To get there, they say government funding is crucial.

""We pick the really outstanding projects that have true potential and we fund them to the point where they can attract additional funding and then begin to move forward,"" said Duncan Stewart, president and scientific director of OIRM.

""Without a catalyst to kick-start the process, then it's not going to happen.""

The scientists see a bitter irony in the government's move, since stem cell research was born in Ontario. James Till and Ernest McCulloch discovered the existence of stem cells in 1961 at the Toronto-based Ontario Cancer Institute.

""It's very deflating, it's very disappointing to learn that this is going to not continue,"" said Stewart.

""The concern is that many great ideas, great technologies that could have blossomed into successful new opportunities commercially and new therapies for our patients just aren't going to move forward.""

Research funded by OIRM attracted a $225-million investment by pharmaceutical giant Bayer and venture capital firm Versant Ventures to create BlueRock Therapeutics, now headquartered in Toronto. The company aims to treat heart disease and degenerative brain diseases.

""We were very excited about what we were able to accomplish with relatively modest funding,"" said Stewart.

The institute was created in 2014, with a promise from the Wynne government of $25 million over five years.

Stewart said he is hopeful the government can be persuaded to renew OIRM's funding instead of stopping it.

""We have a year, and a year is a long time in politics,"" said Stewart.

""We're hoping to use that time to try to position ourselves to continue in some way. Unfortunately, we have no idea what will happen after that."""

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."

Following Britain’s lead, Australia recently passed a law that allows police to compel decryption, which means forcing an accused person to provide their password or unlock a device. However, in Canada and the United States — countries with a constitutional bill of rights — courts are divided on whether compelling a person to reveal their password should be legal.

The issue comes up in cases where police need evidence on a laptop or phone that no company or agency can help them retrieve without a password, or without possibly destroying the data.

Does ordering you to hand over your password entail a form of self-incrimination or a violation of the right to silence? Would granting police the power to compel passwords cross a line centuries old against forcing a person to speak to build the case against them? Or should rights act as a trump card, effectively shutting down prosecutions — leaving victims without justice and shielding criminals from the law?

A recent Ontario case is the first in Canada to deal with the matter directly, and highlights what’s at stake. As a law professor focusing on technology and rights, I was keen to see how the court would resolve these issues.

Warrants for electronic data

In the 2019 case of R v. Shergill, the accused was charged with a series of sexual and child pornography offences involving a 15-year-old girl. Police obtained his phone upon arrest and a warrant to search it, but couldn’t open it without a password.

There are at present no powers in Canadian law that explicitly authorize police to compel an accused to provide a password or unlock a device. But courts do have the power to compel a person to help police do something to execute a warrant.

The Crown in Shergill asked the judge for an assistance order that would compel the accused to open his phone. In response, the defence argued that doing so would offend Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Drawing on American case law, the Crown responded that an order to compel a password would be Charter-compliant for two reasons.

Complying with the Charter

First, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not rule out all forms of compulsion: it permits an accused person to be forced to provide fingerprints, breath and DNA samples. It only prevents the Crown from compelling the accused to testify.

The Crown conceded that handing over a password is a form of testimony, but says the data on the phone is not. Since the data existed before the investigation, compelling an accused person to reveal their password does not force the accused to assist in creating the evidence against them; it only forces them to reveal that they know the password, a fact the court can exclude from the evidence considered in the trial.

Some scholars have gone further, arguing that a password shouldn’t even be considered testimony, since it doesn’t serve the same expressive function as other forms of speech traditionally protected under the Constitution, such as art or political opinion.

The purpose of compelling an accused to reveal their password is not to conscript the accused in helping the prosecution build a case: it simply enables the state to access evidence to which it is lawfully entitled.

The weight of tradition

Justice Philip Downes, who presided over R v. Shergill, disagreed, setting out reasons that closely parallel the prevailing view on password compulsion in U.S. courts.

The act of providing a password or unlocking a phone is a form of testimony, because it entails communicating something that exists only in one’s mind. It is closer in nature to revealing the combination of a safe rather than handing over a physical key.

The data on a phone is also closely tied to the password. In practical terms, since police are unlikely to access the phone’s data without the password, it is unrealistic to say that when an accused is compelled to unlock a phone, the data pre-exists being compelled to do so. Essentially, by handing over their password, the accused creates the evidence used against them.

The judge conceded that encryption poses a serious hurdle for police. Constitutional rights should not serve as an absolute trump card over the state’s interest. But the breach of the accused’s rights here was fundamental in nature and the weight of authority favoured the accused.

Passwords as testimony

The debate in Canada and the U.S. over whether password compulsion is legal turns on the same core issues: is a password a form of testimony? Does the accused help to create the case against them by unlocking a phone? And what is the state’s interest here? Does encryption pose an insurmountable hurdle to prosecution, or is it often only a matter of convenience?

Some law scholars argue that with an ever-growing abundance of other sources of data, compelled decryption is really only a matter of convenience. Others argue that in serious cases — murder, sexual assault — we can’t always find a true substitute for the data we fail to access behind encryption.

One possible way forward is to engage in a balancing of interests on a case-by-case basis, similar to what we do when we decide whether evidence obtained in violation of rights should still be admissible. In each case, we could weigh the severity of the breach with the seriousness of the offence.

Regardless of the solution, however, the problem that data encryption poses to law enforcement continues to pose a challenge. For a society that values the rule of law, it will force us to make hard choices between liberty and justice.

https://www.thestar.com/news/cannabis/2019/05/02/half-a-million-canadians-used-weed-before-or-at-work-national-cannabis-survey.html,Alcohol's been legal for decades and yet coming to work drunk is considered at least somewhat unprofessional.,4.0,4.0,"CALGARY—Roughly 500,000 Canadians used cannabis before — or at — work since February, according to the latest National Cannabis Survey.

The survey’s latest instalment, released by Statistics Canada on Thursday, also found around 21.5 per cent of Albertans aged 15 and older — roughly 750,000 people — reported using cannabis in some form over the last three months. The national average is 18 per cent. Last May, it was closer to 14 per cent, marking what appears to be a slight bump in cannabis use following the legalization of recreational cannabis on Oct. 17.

The National Cannabis Survey has gauged Canadians’ cannabis use since February 2018, but Thursday’s release marked the first time it examined a full three months since legalization. Rebecca Haines-Saah, assistant professor at the University of Calgary’s Cumming School of Medicine, wasn’t surprised by the figures.

“From my familiarity with the data, there’s nothing very shocking about the prevalence changes that we’re seeing,” she said. “It’s what I would expect to see.”

Here are some highlights from the survey:

Roughly half a million Canadians reported using weed before or during work

Punching in after using weed — or simply lighting up on-the-clock — isn’t unusual. Around 514,000 Canadian workers, representing roughly 13 per cent of the country’s cannabis users, do so, according to the survey. Haines-Saah said this isn’t terribly shocking.

“I’m not surprised because many people don’t enjoy going to work, so they’re doing something to get them out of bed and get them out of the house, and go to work,” she said. “I’m not sanctioning that: I’m saying this is probably the reality of many people’s lives.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Workers have long used both legal and illegal substances on-the-clock, including prescription medication. Enjoying a drink at a team meeting with colleagues isn’t unusual — including, Haines-Saah said, in academia. Where it does become problematic is when a worker is using cannabis in a “safety-sensitive” job — such as a crane operator or a truck driver — where a lapse in co-ordination or judgment could lead to a catastrophic accident.

“Obviously, in safety-sensitive positions, we still need to have those strict guidelines and no-tolerance because we don’t want people impaired putting themselves at risk and other people at risk if they’re driving or operating heavy machinery,” Haines-Saah said.

Around 646,000 Canadians tried weed over the last three months — and half are aged 45 or older

This time last year, before Canada legalized recreational cannabis, roughly 327,000 Canadians said they tried weed for the first time. As of Jan. 1, this figure roughly doubled, although it doesn’t just include first-time tokers. The survey included former users who gave weed up, but returned to it after legalization.

Around half of these “new” users since February are in their mid-40s or older, compared to a third of users last year. Haines-Saah said this was expected: in recent years, older Canadians with chronic pain, sleep issues, or who’re undergoing cancer treatment are increasingly turning to cannabis.

“So, it makes sense that boomers are looking for this,” Haines-Saah said. “However, if they’re doing this through the recreational market, I would worry.”

She said medical supervision is important for anyone looking to use cannabis for a health condition.

Daily cannabis use hasn’t changed, but weekly and “occasional” use went up

About 6 per cent of all Canadians over the age of 15 — roughly 1.8 million people — said they use cannabis on a daily or near-daily basis since legalization. Daily weed users, according to the survey, are more likely to be men under the age of 25. Curiously, this rate of use is unchanged from the same time last year. The number of Canadians who use weekly went up 2 per cent, as did those who reported using once or twice in a three-month period.

After Colorado legalized recreational cannabis, Haines-Saah said daily users starting using more intensely — including cannabis with more tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant’s main psychoactive component — and more frequently. Canada’s data doesn’t appear to show a similar pattern, although she said public health is “watching and wrestling” with balancing the broad concerns around cannabis users versus the specific harms an at-risk group — such as daily users — may face.

Around a fifth of Canadians who drove after using weed also had booze in their system

Mixing alcohol and weed, and then getting behind the wheel, can impair a driver more than either substance on its own. According to the survey, around 3 per cent of cannabis users with a valid driver’s licence — roughly 123,000 people — admitted to driving after using both substances. It’s worth noting the rate of Canadians who reported driving within two hours after using weed remains unchanged from a year ago. Haines-Saah said public health guidelines suggest cannabis users wait between four and six hours before hitting the road.

But these figures may be lowballed

Haines-Saah believes the actual rate of Canadians who use cannabis is higher than the survey suggests. Legalization came into effect seven months ago, but she said the stigma around weed use lingers, which could translate into survey respondents lowballing their usage — or simply saying they’ve never tried it.

Researchers also need more data — and more time — to really understand how legalization is affecting Canadians.

“We need more of a five-year and a 10-year marker to make sense of what we’re seeing on the ground,” she said.

In point of fact it will make it even worse, the police that are busy with collecting legal law abiding gun owners property for destruction are not out there helping dissuade violence.",18.0,98.0,"Education Minister Dominic Cardy says any students who don't meet immunization requirements this fall won't be allowed through the school doors unless and until they do.

Cardy isn't just talking about excluding students during an outbreak like the ongoing one in the Saint John area, where 11 cases of measles have been confirmed, nine of which are linked to Kennebecasis Valley High School in Quispamsis. He means barring them from attending school entirely.

""We wouldn't let a child come to school with a gun,"" he said. ""And a child coming to school who's able to transmit easily infectious, fatal diseases is doing just that — they're bringing something dangerous into the school environment,"" he said.

""Certainly, my expectation is that starting in September every child going into a New Brunswick school be there with their vaccine cards to prove that they are not a risk to themselves or others in the school system.""

New Brunswick has a long-standing policy that requires students to either show proof they are immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), varicella (chicken pox) and meningococcal disease, or obtain an exemption for medical or parental objections.

But it hasn't been consistently enforced for years, so the province doesn't know how many unvaccinated students are in the school system.

Cardy intends to change that.

""They will be excluded from school if they are unwilling to follow the rules around health and safety,"" he said, adding he will give people ""a reasonable amount of time"" to comply once public health resources aren't stretched so thin dealing with the measles outbreak.

Personal exemption provision too broad

He also plans to ""tighten up"" the personal exemption provision of Policy 706, which he describes as too broad.

As it stands, parents can ""just say,' I don't want to have my kids vaccinated,'"" he said. ""I don't think that's good enough.

""I am unaware of any faith tradition that tells people that, you know, 'Thy children must be infected with easily preventable diseases.'

""And we also have an option in New Brunswick that if people don't want to be part of a public system, they're free to home school their kids.""

Under Policy 706, children are supposed to be immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, varicella and meningococcal disease before entering the school system. (Canadian Press)

Cardy believes the only exceptions should be for medical reasons to ensure so-called herd immunity, or community immunity.

""If we had that herd immunity, this outbreak wouldn't have happened,"" he said.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, because measles is so highly contagious and spreads so easily, either through the air or direct contact with an infected individual, at least 95 per cent of people need to be vaccinated for herd immunity to work.

""If you don't want to get yourself vaccinated or your kids vaccinated, think about the kids who are suffering from severe immunosuppression"" and can't be vaccinated, said Cardy.

Marissa Gootjes, 15, of Quispamsis, is just one of those students. She was happy to be back at Kennebecasis Valley High School after undergoing brain surgery to remove a cancerous tumour, followed by 13 months of chemotherapy, but now has to stay home because she's at risk of contracting measles.

'Marissa the Fierce' Gootjes, who earned her nickname playing hockey, may be sidelined for the rest of the school year if the measles outbreak continues to grow because she is immunocompromised from undergoing chemotherapy. (Submitted by Jan Gootjes)

Although some people have questioned whether mandatory immunization could violate charter rights, Cardy argued he also has a duty to protect the rights of students who are vulnerable.

""It doesn't make much sense when we spend time talking about move-over laws on highways and bike laws and helmet laws and stuff like that, if we're going to ignore the transmission of infectious, potentially fatal diseases in our schools,"" he said.

""If you're going to be in a public school system, we've got to take public health into account.""

""That's going to be the choice that parents have to make is if they want to participate in the public school system. There are rules around public health there to protect everyone in our society and those rules will be enforced."""
https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/05/16/trudeau-takes-aim-at-big-tech-announces-digital-charter.html,It has no concept of private property.,9.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

Social media giants ignore law, don’t take Canada seriously, say MPs

Star Editorial | Christchurch Call is a good step in fighting extremism

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

Aren't we supposed to be afraid of the Cons for stealing our ability to have abortions, and for ruining our environment?

The stark reality of watching our rights be eroded by the supposed ""good guys"" is mildly disconcerting",12.0,168.0,"Transcript

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is defending a decision to give a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservative Party a role in determining which news organizations are eligible for government funding.

Eight Canadian organizations will select representatives to sit on an advisory panel that will decide how the government should dole out $600-million media support fund, the government announced Wednesday.

They are News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

Unifor — a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservatives under both Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer — represents more than 12,000 journalists and media workers in Canada.

In a statement posted to Facebook, Unifor said critics are mischaracterizing its role on the panel. The union says it will help define the criteria through which the funds will be allocated, but won't be directly involved in deciding who gets the money.

""There is a lot at stake as we work to protect and preserve our news industry in Canada and after years of discussion we finally have a path forward,"" the union said.

As It Happens has reached out to Unifor for comment.

Rodriguez spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the new panel. Here is part of their conversation.

I don't know if you had a chance to read Chris Selley at the National Post ... who says that that your putting Unifor on this panel is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. How do you respond?

We chose different organizations that represent journalists and different media across the country with different regions being represented, both official languages, the ethnic press.

We wanted to make sure that it was representative of the industry, and that's the reason why they're all there.

Why Unifor?

It represents thousands of employees from the news sector.

But it also represents a very, very strong bias, doesn't it? Because Unifor has made it quite clear that they call themselves ""the resistance."" They have put out publicity. I'm sure you've seen their publicity: ""The resistance: Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" If you want to have a panel that appears to be unbiased, how does that help you?

This is Andrew Scheer's opinion, and ...

Excuse me. No, no. This is not Andrew Scheer's opinion. I'm looking at a picture put out. This is Unifor Canada's picture.

We're talking about professionals, which is the case of all the groups there are on this list.

And the reason why we wanted to intervene is because professional journalism is one of the pillars of democracy. And the Conservatives may think that, ""Well, you know what? We shouldn't do anything and then let them all die.""

On the contrary, we're saying, ""No, we have to be there to support them with one clear principle — to respect the freedom and independence of the press.""

Unifor posted this image in a November 2018 tweet that read: 'Unifor’s National Executive Board started planning for the federal election today @AndrewScheer #canlab #canpoli.' (@UniforTheUnion/Twitter)

That's not the issue here. The issue is that you said you were going to put together a panel, an advisory panel, to decide who is going to get the funds, the $600 million worth of support to the media in this country, and that you would have an unbiased and an independent panel.

Yes, which is the case.

Mr. Rodriguez, have you not seen the publicity that Unifor is putting out calling themselves ""the resistance"" and saying, ""Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" Have you not seen that?

I know what you're talking about.

The Conservatives are saying that Unifor, any people working or any journalists, can be bought by this program, which is not the case, and I think it's an insult to professional journalists that build their career on integrity and on independence and on professionalism.

We're talking about the people on the panel. We're not talking about the journalists who might be benefiting from these funds. We saw that Unifor, it was quite partisan during the 2015 election campaign, that they put out attack ads against Stephen Harper's Conservatives, which surely helped you get elected. So, again, we're back to this problem of an appearance of bias. That if you have, if you are giving this position to Unifor, to the union, to decide who is going to get this funding, when it's an organization that has clearly come out ... going against your political enemies, that's a problem, isn't it?

This is repeating what Andrew Scheer is saying. And, again, I have to disagree with you, because if you look at the role the associations are playing, the role ... the journalists are playing, they're there to ask the tough questions — just exactly like what you're doing.

And also, this proves my point that we need that type of journalism of tough questions. And maybe the Conservatives, they don't want to hear those questions, but I think they're absolutely necessary in our democracy. So that's why the panel is in place. That's why we're moving forward.

But you've asked this panel to help decide who is a proper journalist and what's a proper news outlet and who is worthy of these funds. And who you've put on the panel that gets to decide that an organization that has a very, very strong, very partisan political statement.

But you keep repeating the same thing.

Because I'm not getting a very good answer from you.

I am answering your question and I'm saying that it's a panel with different people there from different sides of the industry, all representing professional journalists.

I guess what I'm trying to get to ... is that you want people to trust this fund, and Canadians want journalism they can trust. They want to believe that it's unbiased. But if the critics of your fund have always raised the alarm about any possible bias, that's why you wanted to have an independent panel. But haven't you just walked into that trap?

No, these panels represent people from all sides of industry. It represents work as a journalist, it represents the owners, it represents francophones, anglophones, the different regions, the ethnic media. It represents everybody.

And you don't think that there is a bias here, or a perception of bias, if you have as one of your panel members — and I know I'm asking you this once again, and I apologize for that, but I still haven't got a clear answer — do you not think that this is a problem of bias?

But I did answer your question.

You don't think that there's any bias on the part of Unifor, that Unifor doesn't have a political agenda?

No, you're saying that the journalists they represent have their own agenda.

No, no, I'm not saying that.

Yes, you're saying that.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm not. The panel you put together has Unifor as one of its members. And the question is that an organization that is clearly partisan and anti-Conservative, and have made that very clear, we're asking if that's an appropriate party to have on this panel?

We're saying that we need people from all walks of life. In this case ... people that represent the workers, the employers, the regions, the official languages and all of that to be represented there to make sure that this panel represents all of them, and that it takes neutral decisions on professional journalism.

Because we need professional journalism in our society. You're there to ask the tough questions. Again, that's exactly what you're doing and this is what we need.

*On fire*. You forgot that part.",7.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/transmountain-pipeline-environment-question-1.5147454,That does actually reduce the effectiveness of my snide remark a bit.,2.0,27.0,"B.C.'s Court of Appeal will decide Friday whether the province can change its environmental laws in a way that could effectively kill the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.

The province's top court was asked to weigh in on proposed amendments to B.C.'s Environmental Management Act forcing anyone wanting to transport increased quantities of ""heavy oil"" to seek provincial permission.

While B.C.'s attorney general argues the government has the right to enact laws aimed at protecting British Columbians from the effects of a catastrophic spill, Ottawa claims the move is a ruse designed with just one target in mind: the proposed twinning of a 1,150 pipeline to move bitumen from Edmonton to the West Coast.

The case revolves around weighty legal and constitutional issues, but it boils down to a few fundamental questions about the role of government in the lives of Canadians — and the balance between local and national interests.

In his opening arguments, Joseph Arvay, counsel for B.C., pointed to the array of lawyers for ""pipelines and railways and others in the oil and gas industry"" who had lined up to oppose him.

He claimed their arguments all boiled down to one thing:

""That even if the pipelines or railways they own or operate create a risk of even catastrophic environmental harm because of the substance they carry, the province is nevertheless powerless to enact laws to prevent that risk from materializing,"" Arvay told the five appeal court judges.

""We say that the province is not required to accept such a fate.""

'A Trojan horse'

The appeal court battle is the latest in a series of legal and political hurdles the pipeline expansion has faced since then-owner Kinder Morgan first lodged its plans with the National Energy Board (NEB) in 2013.

Last year, the federal government announced plans to buy the $4.5 billion pipeline from Kinder Morgan shareholders, who expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the approval process.

The Federal Court of Appeal put the project on hold in 2018 after finding that the government had not adequately consulted with First Nations and the NEB had failed to fully consider impacts on marine life.

Ottawa has since moved to rectify those shortcomings.

The reference question was debated over five days in March. It's one of the rare proceedings B.C.'s appeal court has decided to webcast.

Jan Brongers, lawyer for Canada's attorney general, acknowledged the ""superficial attraction"" of Arvay's argument. But he warned the judges against falling for it.

""Our main concern is that this legislation appears to be a Trojan horse,"" he said.

""It's one that's designed to appear as constitutionally acceptable local environmental protection measures, but in substance it's an unconstitutional initiative whose only logical reason for being is to limit federally regulated pipelines and railways from moving additional quantities of heavy oil.""

The court has been asked to consider three basic questions:

Does B.C. have the authority to enact the proposed amendments?

Would those rules apply to ""heavy oil"" from another province?

Would existing federal legislation trump the provincial rules in any event?

The federal government argued that it has exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines and railways, and that B.C.'s legislation is simply a bid to kill a project the provincial NDP government vigorously opposes.

But Arvay claimed B.C. isn't trying to usurp Ottawa's power — that instead the proposed amendments would work in tandem with federal laws to ensure locals are protected from the risks of projects in their backyards.

""Decisions affecting individuals should as far as reasonably possible be made by the level of government closest to the individuals affected,"" he told the court.

Strange bedfellows

A host of intervenors have lined up on either side of the debate, with the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby supporting British Columbia along with the Assembly of First Nations.

""Local governments and First Nations governments are on the front lines of emergency response for their communities,"" the City of Vancouver said in its written arguments.

""It is these communities that are at risk from a heavy oil accident and who will suffer the impacts.""

Several individual First Nations have also aligned themselves with the government of Canada, along with a number of oil and gas industry groups and the attorneys general of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Alberta said the provinces and Ottawa should work together to protect the environment, but B.C. can't take unilateral steps that would result in the obstruction or delay of the project.

Regardless of what the appeal court decides, the ultimate decision on the law is likely to rest with the Supreme Court of Canada."

If they did a referendum, it would have been a clusterfuck and failed. We've never managed to have a successful referendum in this country. I suspect we could hold one on whether the sky is blue and still get 45% Yes/55% No. 

If they didn't do a referendum, they would have been accused by the opposition of changing the rules in their benefit, and of derailing democracy. 

So they chose to just swallow the bitter pill and give up immediately, &amp; move on to other legislative goals like legalizing marijuana and the carbon tax.",2.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

The Mounties released a statement last week defending their handling of the case and — as late as Monday — had turned aside further requests for comment."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/waste-recyclables-malaysia-philippines-cbc-explains-1.5153399,"This is, I think, an excellent idea! Hats off to you sir!",2.0,134.0,"For the second time in five weeks, an angry government in Asia is demanding Canada take back unwanted waste.

First it was the Philippines — now Malaysia .

Many Canadians have been surprised — and unhappy — to learn that Canada sends vast amounts of its recyclable waste overseas.

They've been dutifully putting their plastic, glass and paper into the blue bin, believing they are doing the right thing for the environment. But the recycling process can be complicated, and the outcome isn't always as green as we might think.

What happens to what I put in the blue bin?

According to Myra Hird of the School of Environmental Studies at Queen's University, we don't really know.

""People think that when they put something in their recycling bin, it's actually going to be recycled. But this is not the case.""

She said the waste might be recycled, but everything depends on market value. (More on that later.)

You may be tossing your recyclables into a blue bin supplied by a municipal recycling program, but the municipal government's responsibility ends once the blue bin contents are sold to a recycling company. Waste and recycling is for the most part handled by private industry in Canada.

Canadian recycling companies take the material from municipal programs and sort it, clean it and compress it into smaller cubes. Those cubes are then put up for auction.

""[Municipalities] are only responsible for that first contract,"" said Hird. They need to know where the recycling and the waste first goes. After that, they're not responsible for knowing the rest of that chain.""

Recycling is a ritual in a lot of Canadian homes, and we do it with the best intentions. But intentions in our kitchens may not be good enough. Media ID: 2:20

Who buys it?

It might be bought by a Canadian company that will further process it into pellets that are sold to the plastics industry to be used in new products — such as pipes or plastic bags.

But it could also be bought by a recycling broker who will sell it again — often to companies overseas who seek to make a profit from it. All perfectly legal. But, said Hird, hard to follow.

""These brokers mean that these contracts can change hands several times between the source and the destination."" And, she said, there is no accountability.

For years, China was a huge market for the developed world's plastic waste, taking in about 45 per cent of the world's plastics waste since 1992 . But last year, China announced it no longer wants it. Canada, and other countries, needed to find new markets.

How is Canadian plastic waste ending up in Asian countries?

""We don't like to keep our waste around,"" said Hird, ""so we move it between regions. We transport waste to the United States, to South Korea, to obviously, Malaysia, the Philippines and elsewhere.""

And while companies in those countries may be willing to buy it, governments in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam started to crack down late last year — imposing bans and stricter regulations.

Malaysia's environment minister opened a container of contaminated Canadian plastic scrap at Port Klang. The country says it will send the unwanted waste back. (Eric Szeto/CBC)

Companies buy recyclable waste, because they can make money on it. This is where market value comes in. But recycling, said Hird, is not a stable industry.

""Something that we put in the recycling bin in January … that may get recycled if there's value in it, if there's a market in it."" But if there's no market, she said, then by November or December, that same material might be put in landfill because there's no longer a significant profit to be made.

What's more, said Martin Vogt, president of Ontario-based company EFS-plastics, overseas companies do not always recycle all of what we send. ""They're picking out the good plastics, and that plastic will be recycled. But most of it ends up in the oceans, in landfills … and sometimes it's burned.""

How much does Canada recycle itself?

Much less than you might think.

""Canada recycles only nine per cent of the plastic that we use here in this country,"" according to Keith Brooks of Environment Defence.

And Hird cautions that Canadians are not made aware of the costs of recycling. ""Recycling means changing that material, which often involves significant transportation.""

She uses an example of polystyrene — a standard, versatile foam plastic used to make everything from food containers to protective packaging — that is collected in Kingston.

""[It] gets shipped to northern Ontario using trucks that use non-renewable fossil fuels. It's then liquefied and made smaller, more compact, and then it's put on more trucks which are then taken to Montreal, which then are put on ships that go to the United States and go to South Korea. All of this for one more use for that polystyrene.""

So is recycling in Canada working?

According to Brooks, not really.

""We need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use. That means banning some plastic [by] the government. We need to hold producers responsible for this plastic ultimately — that's a really important thing. And we need government to take action to do that.

In British Columbia, legislation shifted the onus of handling recycling onto the businesses that create the waste, something known as ""extended producer responsibility."" Recycle B.C, a non-profit, took responsibility for the province's waste recycling about five years ago. It works to keep contamination levels low, so its recycled products are usually higher quality, making them easier to sell.

And Recycle B.C. spokesperson David Lefebvre told CBC News in April,""all of the plastic that's collected here in the province ends up here in B.C.""

There are calls for the Canadian government to create a stronger end market for recyclables, by making it mandatory for manufacturers to use a certain amount of recycled material in new products. (CBC News)

Is there a solution?

Vogt agrees the solution requires government involvement, but had a different take than Brooks.

He said governments need to, ""come out and say we need to have recycled content in our products in order to create the circle economy and basically get the industry going.""

But Brooks and Hird both say the real solution lies in reducing all waste, not relying on recycling."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/snc-lavalin-trial-corruption-bribery-1.5153429,Given who they were bribing I actually would not be remotely surprised if people were murdered.,1.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

'These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,' SNC-Lavalin's president and CEO Neil Bruce said Wednesday. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

Operating profit for companies in oil and gas extraction and support services rose by $1.6 billion in the first three months after a loss of $678 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $909 million, according to Statistics Canada.

""This increase was attributable to a rise in oil prices,"" the report said.

Even though global oil prices have been facing volatility this week — along with the rest of the stock market — on concerns over the impact of the trade war between the United States and China, prices have skyrocketed since the start of the year.

Benchmark U.S. oil — West Texas Intermediate — is up nearly 30 per cent this year to $58.45 US a barrel. It shot up above $60 a barrel in March for the first time in 2019.

Meanwhile, Western Canadian Select oil has jumped more than 45 per cent to over $41 a barrel.

Energy led gains among all industries

The gain in operating profit in the energy sector outpaced all other major Canadian industries in the first quarter.

The manufacturing and real estate sectors were the only other major industries that saw operating profit increase, while it declined for financial, technology, wholesale trade and retail sectors, according to Statistics Canada.

(Statistics Canada)

Even within manufacturing, operating profit for petroleum and coal product manufacturers rose 5.6 per cent ""due to higher oil prices,"" the report said.

But, the government agency also pointed out that inventory levels among oil and gas companies grew in 2018. The Alberta government had introduced mandatory production cuts in December to buoy the price of Canadian oil.

""It seemed that as pipelines and railcars reached their full capacity, producers could not get their crude oil to market and had to put barrels into storage tanks,"" the report said. ""Ultimately, this translated into higher inventories in the balance sheet of Canadian enterprises in the oil and gas extraction and support activities.""

Operating profit down in Canada

Meanwhile, overall operating profit among all Canadian businesses fell 0.3 per cent to $107 billion in the first quarter from the previous one.

The mixed picture for Canadian businesses, varying by sector, is not surprising — considering many economists expect growth in the first quarter to be subdued.

On the lower end of market consensus, Brian DePratto, senior economist at TD Economics, is forecasting that the Canadian economy grew at an annualized quarterly rate of 0.4 per cent in the first three months — the same as in the previous quarter.

""A very weak export performance, measurement differences, and a downgraded picture of construction activity from Statistics Canada all point to quarterly GDP underperforming the monthly indicators,"" he said in a note on Friday.

The first quarter GDP data is scheduled to be released May 31."

As of right now, video game companies can apply for tax credits from the province after completing a game project. The company had to spend at least $1 million each fiscal year in labour cost to qualify for the credit.

Now, under the new rules, companies will be able to apply annually as opposed to when the game is done, which usually takes several years to complete. On top of that, the spending threshold for labour has been reduced to $500,000 per year in order to make it easier for smaller teams to qualify.

In a government release, economic development, job creation and trade minister Todd Smith says this proposal is all part of the PC government’s initiative that Ontario is “open for business.”

“We’re committed to making Ontario an even better place for video game developers to do business,” said Smith. “The current tax credit certification process is slow and complex, leaving some companies waiting more than a year for tax credits they’re entitled to.”

The change, according to the government, is part of the 2019 provincial budget, and is all part of the certification of the Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit. Eligible companies include those who develop video games and other digital products, such as e-learning tools and virtual reality experiences.

Jean-Sylvain Sormany, studio head for Snowed In Studios, a developer in Ottawa, says the change will create a huge benefit and advantage for developers in the province, especially the smaller ones.

“I think this change is great. One of the problems is the complexity of the application process,” said Sormany. “The easier access allows them to grow faster in a positive enterprise.”

According to Sormany, the credit can cover between 35 and 40 per cent of costs for labour towards game production, and with the ability to apply for this credit annually, this change aligns the credit with similar ones found in other provinces.

Sormany even goes so far to say that his own company has been able to grow from around 25 developers to 65 in one year thanks, in part, to the tax credit — and that was the older model.

I'm buying a parakeet.",2.0,9.0,"The Trudeau government is expanding a federal loan guarantee program for farmers in response to Western Canada's canola crisis — more than doubling the maximum amount of money available to individual producers.

CBC News has learned the federal government is set to announce at a news conference Wednesday morning a boost to the maximum amount available to individual farmers under the Advance Payments Program (APP), from $400,000 per year to $1 million.

The news comes not long after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised that help for canola farmers would be ""coming out in a few days.""

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr will announce details at a news conference on Parliament Hill at 9:30 a.m. ET and CBCNews.ca will carry it live.

Under the former APP rules, producers could receive up to $400,000 per year in advances based on the value of their crops or livestock, with the federal government paying the interest on the first $100,000.

Producers repay the advances after they sell their product. Cash advanced for most commodities has to be repaid in 18 months; cattle and bison producers get 24 months to pay.

Ottawa is changing the APP rules in response to market turmoil in the canola sector. China has blocked Canadian canola seed from Richardson International and Viterra, two of Canada's biggest exporters, saying that shipments were contaminated with pests.

Other China-bound shipments of Canadian canola have been cancelled, forcing exporters to sell the seed elsewhere at a discount. And Reuters reports more commodities are hitting inspection roadblocks at Chinese ports, leaving exporters to scramble for alternate markets.

Canadian politicians have insisted there is no basis for China's pest claim. China's move is widely seen as an act of retaliation over Canada's decision to arrest Meng Wanzhou, an executive with the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, for extradition to the United States.

""Canadians know, of course, as do people around the world, that Canadian food inspection and the quality of Canadian agriculture and produce is world-class, and the processes we have cannot be beaten anywhere in the world,"" Trudeau told a media event Monday morning.

While the move is being driven by the plight of canola growers, the revised APP program is available to all farmers. For canola farmers, however, the federal government is increasing the interest-free portion of the cash advances to $500,000.

Prime Minister Trudeau is expected to call premiers tonight to fill them in on the new APP rules.

Meanwhile, the Trudeau government is trying to go to the source to end China's trade action. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau recently sent a formal request to Beijing for permission to send Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials to China to personally inspect Canadian canola shipments for pests.

Sources tell CBC News that while Chinese officials have been talking positively about the trade relationship with Canada and their desire to solve the canola spat, they've yet to give the CFIA permission to send its own inspectors to China. The sources said the federal government isn't viewing China's stance as an outright rejection of its proposal and plans to keep pushing the idea with Beijing.

Meanwhile, Ottawa continues to search for new markets for Canadian canola. International Trade Minister Jim Carr is expected to lead a trade mission to locate buyers beyond the Chinese market but the government isn't sharing details at this point."

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

Niqilurniq is a new cookbook written in Inuktitut Roman orthography. It was compiled by Annie Desilets, who went to school for cooking at the Institut de tourisme et d'hôtellerie du Québec in Montreal. She worked on the book with four Inuit women in Igloolik — Micah Arreak, Lucy Kappianaq, Glenda Kripanik and Kanadaise Uyarasuk.

Desilets says the idea came to her in 2012, when she was giving cooking lessons in the community.

""I could see there was a lot of interest into learning how to cook, and interest into sharing recipes in the community,"" she said.

""There's not [many] recipes you can find with country food in books, or on the internet, and lots of recipes are difficult to do because you can't find the ingredients in small community stores. So this cookbook takes care of this reality.""

It's split into three sections: imaq, food from the sea; nuna, food from the land; and palaugaat, which is bread recipes.

""We decided not to do like entrees, main dish and this stuff because it's very like southerners' way of thinking,"" said Desilets.

The book doesn't just offer recipes — it also gives nutrition tips.

Desilets said she hopes the book inspires readers to link country food with the types of food available in stores, and give an alternative to prepackaged foods.

""It was important for us to share this knowledge so people can make better choices, know more about what they're eating,"" she said.

""And personally, as a cook, I just wanted to share the joy of cooking.""

Niqilurniq is only available in Inuktitut right now, but Desilets says Inhabit Media is working on an English version. It's for sale on the Inhabit Media website and offered for free as a PDF on the Nunavut Bilingual Education Society website.

As for Nunavummiut who might want to share their own recipes?

""I encourage people from other communities to do [it],"" said Desilets. ""It's … so much fun to do, just sharing recipes, trying it together."""

Following Britain’s lead, Australia recently passed a law that allows police to compel decryption, which means forcing an accused person to provide their password or unlock a device. However, in Canada and the United States — countries with a constitutional bill of rights — courts are divided on whether compelling a person to reveal their password should be legal.

The issue comes up in cases where police need evidence on a laptop or phone that no company or agency can help them retrieve without a password, or without possibly destroying the data.

Does ordering you to hand over your password entail a form of self-incrimination or a violation of the right to silence? Would granting police the power to compel passwords cross a line centuries old against forcing a person to speak to build the case against them? Or should rights act as a trump card, effectively shutting down prosecutions — leaving victims without justice and shielding criminals from the law?

A recent Ontario case is the first in Canada to deal with the matter directly, and highlights what’s at stake. As a law professor focusing on technology and rights, I was keen to see how the court would resolve these issues.

Warrants for electronic data

In the 2019 case of R v. Shergill, the accused was charged with a series of sexual and child pornography offences involving a 15-year-old girl. Police obtained his phone upon arrest and a warrant to search it, but couldn’t open it without a password.

There are at present no powers in Canadian law that explicitly authorize police to compel an accused to provide a password or unlock a device. But courts do have the power to compel a person to help police do something to execute a warrant.

The Crown in Shergill asked the judge for an assistance order that would compel the accused to open his phone. In response, the defence argued that doing so would offend Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Drawing on American case law, the Crown responded that an order to compel a password would be Charter-compliant for two reasons.

Complying with the Charter

First, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not rule out all forms of compulsion: it permits an accused person to be forced to provide fingerprints, breath and DNA samples. It only prevents the Crown from compelling the accused to testify.

The Crown conceded that handing over a password is a form of testimony, but says the data on the phone is not. Since the data existed before the investigation, compelling an accused person to reveal their password does not force the accused to assist in creating the evidence against them; it only forces them to reveal that they know the password, a fact the court can exclude from the evidence considered in the trial.

Some scholars have gone further, arguing that a password shouldn’t even be considered testimony, since it doesn’t serve the same expressive function as other forms of speech traditionally protected under the Constitution, such as art or political opinion.

The purpose of compelling an accused to reveal their password is not to conscript the accused in helping the prosecution build a case: it simply enables the state to access evidence to which it is lawfully entitled.

The weight of tradition

Justice Philip Downes, who presided over R v. Shergill, disagreed, setting out reasons that closely parallel the prevailing view on password compulsion in U.S. courts.

The act of providing a password or unlocking a phone is a form of testimony, because it entails communicating something that exists only in one’s mind. It is closer in nature to revealing the combination of a safe rather than handing over a physical key.

The data on a phone is also closely tied to the password. In practical terms, since police are unlikely to access the phone’s data without the password, it is unrealistic to say that when an accused is compelled to unlock a phone, the data pre-exists being compelled to do so. Essentially, by handing over their password, the accused creates the evidence used against them.

The judge conceded that encryption poses a serious hurdle for police. Constitutional rights should not serve as an absolute trump card over the state’s interest. But the breach of the accused’s rights here was fundamental in nature and the weight of authority favoured the accused.

Passwords as testimony

The debate in Canada and the U.S. over whether password compulsion is legal turns on the same core issues: is a password a form of testimony? Does the accused help to create the case against them by unlocking a phone? And what is the state’s interest here? Does encryption pose an insurmountable hurdle to prosecution, or is it often only a matter of convenience?

Some law scholars argue that with an ever-growing abundance of other sources of data, compelled decryption is really only a matter of convenience. Others argue that in serious cases — murder, sexual assault — we can’t always find a true substitute for the data we fail to access behind encryption.

One possible way forward is to engage in a balancing of interests on a case-by-case basis, similar to what we do when we decide whether evidence obtained in violation of rights should still be admissible. In each case, we could weigh the severity of the breach with the seriousness of the offence.

Regardless of the solution, however, the problem that data encryption poses to law enforcement continues to pose a challenge. For a society that values the rule of law, it will force us to make hard choices between liberty and justice.

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cannabis-use-statistics-canada-1.5121125,"""Now that it's legal, it's just not cool anymore...""",3.0,60.0,"More Canadians say they've used cannabis recreationally since it was legalized last fall, particularly those aged 45 to 64 and males, according to Statistics Canada.

About 18 per cent of Canadians 15 and older, or about 5.3 million people, reported pot use in the last three months, the federal agency said in its quarterly report on Thursday.

Early indications point to more use right after it was legalized last October, when the reported use stood at 14 per cent.

""One of the things … unique with this survey is the number of respondents who said they're using for the first time. So they started, in this case, in the post-legalization period,"" said Michelle Rotermann, a senior analyst in Statistics Canada's health analysis division.

In the first three months of 2018, about 330,000 Canadians said they'd tried cannabis for the first time. A year later, it was up to 650,000, she said.

J.F. Crépault, a senior policy analyst at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), says the Toronto facility wants to see if the initial spike in use translates into longer-term, problematic use.

Following legalization in Colorado, for instance, cannabis use spiked, then rates went back down to about the same as in surrounding states where it remains illegal, Crépault said.

""Researchers sometimes refer to this as a 'straw fire effect' in the sense that it kind of burns bright for a very short amount of time and then goes back down,"" he said.

The greatest proportion of users are aged 18 to 25 (30 per cent) compared with people in their mid-20s and older. But an increasing proportion of new users were aged 45 and older.

The average age of a cannabis user in the country is now 38, Rotermann said.

Many of them are men. Cannabis use increased among males, from 16 per cent last year to 22 per cent so far this year. There was no change among females.

Daily, or almost daily, use of cannabis was unchanged, while weekly and occasional use increased.

Crépault said doctors and medical researchers are looking for any long-term increases in the number of people using cannabis, and, more important, people using cannabis more frequently or more heavily or, ""even worse, starting to use it earlier in life.""

Crépault said at CAMH they're keeping an eye on the national quarterly reports, but recognize that rates of use are an imperfect indicator: Not everyone in the population who uses is harmed.

Early evidence coming out of U.S. states with easier access to medical cannabis or legalized non-medical use of cannabis shows there seem to be reductions in opioid-related overdoses and fatal overdoses. That could be because people are either self-medicating or obtaining opioid prescriptions legitimately and taking the drug long-term and switching to cannabis instead, Crépault said.

He noted that in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, harm-reduction proponents are unofficially providing free cannabis to those who use injection drugs to reduce their opioid intake.

""If cannabis use does increase in the population, we need to make sure that we're also keeping track of patterns of alcohol use or opioid use. It'll take a long time for us to know for sure what the kind of relationships are between these.""

Overall, 15 per cent of cannabis users with a valid driver's licence reported driving within two hours of consuming. That amounts to 675,000 people. Experts advise waiting more than two hours before driving.

Of that group, about 15 per cent, or 125,000 people, also reported they'd consumed alcohol as well — a first for the agency to report.

""Any impaired driving is too much,"" Rotermann said, though she acknowledged that problems with impaired driving existed before legalization of cannabis.

An estimated 47 per cent of cannabis users, or 2.5 million Canadians, bought pot legally during that time, up from 23 per cent, or 954,000 people, during the same period a year ago.

As well, 38 per cent of users said they bought cannabis illegally during the first three months of 2019, compared with 51 per cent a year earlier."

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/transmountain-pipeline-environment-question-1.5147454,GOOOOOOOOOAALLLLLLLL,8.0,27.0,"B.C.'s Court of Appeal will decide Friday whether the province can change its environmental laws in a way that could effectively kill the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.

The province's top court was asked to weigh in on proposed amendments to B.C.'s Environmental Management Act forcing anyone wanting to transport increased quantities of ""heavy oil"" to seek provincial permission.

While B.C.'s attorney general argues the government has the right to enact laws aimed at protecting British Columbians from the effects of a catastrophic spill, Ottawa claims the move is a ruse designed with just one target in mind: the proposed twinning of a 1,150 pipeline to move bitumen from Edmonton to the West Coast.

The case revolves around weighty legal and constitutional issues, but it boils down to a few fundamental questions about the role of government in the lives of Canadians — and the balance between local and national interests.

In his opening arguments, Joseph Arvay, counsel for B.C., pointed to the array of lawyers for ""pipelines and railways and others in the oil and gas industry"" who had lined up to oppose him.

He claimed their arguments all boiled down to one thing:

""That even if the pipelines or railways they own or operate create a risk of even catastrophic environmental harm because of the substance they carry, the province is nevertheless powerless to enact laws to prevent that risk from materializing,"" Arvay told the five appeal court judges.

""We say that the province is not required to accept such a fate.""

'A Trojan horse'

The appeal court battle is the latest in a series of legal and political hurdles the pipeline expansion has faced since then-owner Kinder Morgan first lodged its plans with the National Energy Board (NEB) in 2013.

Last year, the federal government announced plans to buy the $4.5 billion pipeline from Kinder Morgan shareholders, who expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the approval process.

The Federal Court of Appeal put the project on hold in 2018 after finding that the government had not adequately consulted with First Nations and the NEB had failed to fully consider impacts on marine life.

Ottawa has since moved to rectify those shortcomings.

The reference question was debated over five days in March. It's one of the rare proceedings B.C.'s appeal court has decided to webcast.

Jan Brongers, lawyer for Canada's attorney general, acknowledged the ""superficial attraction"" of Arvay's argument. But he warned the judges against falling for it.

""Our main concern is that this legislation appears to be a Trojan horse,"" he said.

""It's one that's designed to appear as constitutionally acceptable local environmental protection measures, but in substance it's an unconstitutional initiative whose only logical reason for being is to limit federally regulated pipelines and railways from moving additional quantities of heavy oil.""

The court has been asked to consider three basic questions:

Does B.C. have the authority to enact the proposed amendments?

Would those rules apply to ""heavy oil"" from another province?

Would existing federal legislation trump the provincial rules in any event?

The federal government argued that it has exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines and railways, and that B.C.'s legislation is simply a bid to kill a project the provincial NDP government vigorously opposes.

But Arvay claimed B.C. isn't trying to usurp Ottawa's power — that instead the proposed amendments would work in tandem with federal laws to ensure locals are protected from the risks of projects in their backyards.

""Decisions affecting individuals should as far as reasonably possible be made by the level of government closest to the individuals affected,"" he told the court.

Strange bedfellows

A host of intervenors have lined up on either side of the debate, with the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby supporting British Columbia along with the Assembly of First Nations.

""Local governments and First Nations governments are on the front lines of emergency response for their communities,"" the City of Vancouver said in its written arguments.

""It is these communities that are at risk from a heavy oil accident and who will suffer the impacts.""

Several individual First Nations have also aligned themselves with the government of Canada, along with a number of oil and gas industry groups and the attorneys general of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Alberta said the provinces and Ottawa should work together to protect the environment, but B.C. can't take unilateral steps that would result in the obstruction or delay of the project.

Regardless of what the appeal court decides, the ultimate decision on the law is likely to rest with the Supreme Court of Canada."

Addressing it could do a lot to mitigate these floods and save money for both cities and farmers downstream.",8.0,12.0,"Matt Ness's farm near the Red River in rural Minnesota has never flooded since his family started farming there in 1941. But now the property is slated to be flooded on purpose — and potentially often — to protect two cities 30 kilometres downstream.

The 2,500 acres he farms, located south of Fargo, N.D., and Moorhead, Minn., is in the middle of what will become a retention area for floodwater once a multibillion-dollar diversion project is constructed. A 50-kilometre channel will usher overflow from the Red River around the flood-prone Fargo-Moorhead area.

""It puts us in a tough situation,"" said Ness. ""A lot of unknowns as far as how it's going to affect us, our neighbours, the farming community.""

Fargo is the last and largest urban area in North Dakota that doesn't have permanent flood protection from the Red River. The Red, which flows north and cuts between Minnesota and North Dakota, rises every spring and has historically caused major flooding in Grand Forks, N.D., and farther downstream in Winnipeg.

Fargo has managed to avoid disaster — but just barely. The city was pushed to its flood-fighting limits in 1997, 2009 and 2011. Officials estimate damages could run upward of $18 billion if the city were to experience a catastrophic flood today.

For the past decade, officials have been navigating tricky regulatory, legal and political issues as they to try to build the diversion project. It's complicated given the fact the river cuts through two cities, in two different states, and requires agreement and funding from both of the cities and states, as well as the federal government.

The challenge is similar to what officials could face for any cross-jurisdictional, flood-mitigation projects in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

While the $2.75-billion Fargo-Moorhead diversion project continues to clear legislative and funding hurdles, people whose homes and property will be placed in the path of the man-made flood plain argue there has to be a better way to protect the 230,000 people who live in the metro area.

""We don't believe that it's right to start to stage water on areas of land that don't flood, to protect land that currently floods,"" said Minnesota farmer Mark Askegaard, a colleague of Ness's at the MnDak Upstream Coalition, a group that opposes the diversion plan.

'Farming is a way of life'

Construction on a section of the diversion in North Dakota started in 2017 but was halted by a legal injunction launched by Minnesota. A judge modified the injunction last month, allowing construction to resume. The project also recently secured an additional $480 million from North Dakota and the federal government.

Work is projected to take 6½ years and could resume in the next 30-90 days. If completed and operated as planned, 90 per cent of Ness's land will be at risk of flooding.

Ness is in the process of taking over the farm from his aging father. He's been holding off on moving his family to the property. Just a few months ago, his parents received notice they'd be required to sell their home to the Fargo-Moorhead Diversion Authority and move out. They would have to live elsewhere but could possibly still farm there.

""Farming is a way of life,"" Ness said. His father has lived on the farm his entire life.

""The connections to the area, the land, the farmstead. It's just tough not knowing where it's going to go from here.""

Frankly, what works in Grand Forks, or works in Winnipeg, may not work somewhere very close by. - Rocky Schneider, spokesperson for the Fargo-Moorhead Diversion Authority

The MnDak Upstream Coalition isn't convinced the diversion authority has fully accounted for all the potential impacts and problems the project will cause upstream. The group is particularly concerned about how affected families and businesses will be compensated if their properties are damaged or no longer usable.

They say the diversion authority hasn't been able to tell them how much money they would receive for not only their homes, but all of the buildings and amenities they've built on their farms.

They are also concerned for people who will have to live elsewhere but plan to continue farming their land. They say it isn't clear how compensation will work if a farmer's property is used for water retention.

For example, water retention wouldn't last the entire summer, but the debris that's left behind could potentially delay seeding. Askegaard says many farmers have contractual obligations for delivering crops, and any delays would cause major financial strain.

""I'm not arguing that Fargo doesn't need a diversion, but I think the scope of the project can be downsized. And if they do that, and they don't protect so much undeveloped flood plain, there will be fewer impacts upstream of the project and probably totally eliminate all the impacts to the state of Minnesota.""

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney says his city and the surrounding area need the diversion to keep them safe and allow for investment and growth. (Warren Kay)

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney says the diversion is essential but some people forget why the sacrifices of some are necessary.

""If you're closer to the flood, then people understand what needs to be done. As you move farther away from the flood, then it's not as personal to them,"" he said.

An hour north of Fargo, and downstream on the Red River, is Grand Forks, N.D., and East Grand Forks, Minn. — two communities where many residents know the devastation of floods first-hand and have taken action to try to prevent them permanently.

""Come quick! Downtown Grand Forks is on fire.""

That's what Jon Bonzer's sister-in-law said after he pulled into her driveway in Fargo in the spring of 1997. His family and more than 50,000 other Grand Forks and East Grand Forks residents had to flee their homes after levees failed and more than a metre of water flooded both communities.

After the evacuation, a fire broke out in downtown Grand Forks, destroying 60 apartments and 11 historic buildings, including Bonzer's pub.

""The real kick down here was watching our business burn down, on TV, from 80 miles away,"" he said. ""It was difficult.""

Weeks later, when he was finally able to return to the community, he already knew his business was gone, so he went to check on his house. He says he didn't open his eyes until he was standing on the main floor and could tell his feet weren't in water.

""I just got on my knees and said, 'Thank you,' because I was overwhelmed that I had a house that was standing. I had eight feet of water to remove from the basement, which was a monumental task, but the alternative would have been I would have lost the house as well.""

Bonzer could be considered one of the lucky ones. More than 2,500 homes and structures were demolished, moved or voluntarily bought out — some as a result of the flood damage and others to make room for permanent flood protection infrastructure.

Grand Forks city councillor Ken Vein, who worked as a city engineer during the flood in 1997, says difficult decisions had to be made and certain areas could not be redeveloped.

""We had to correct a lot of planning and the implementations from years past. We had an opportunity to do it right and that's what I think we accomplished,"" he said.

At the time, the city looked at the Winnipeg floodway as a possible option but decided it would push urban problems onto rural areas, Vein said. Officials also decided it would be too costly for a smaller city to do a project of that scale, including purchasing the necessary land, he said.

So Grand Forks decided to push neighbourhoods and development back from the river to create space for a small amount of water retention and a system of flood walls and earthen levees. Instead of those buildings along the riverbank, there are now several parks, a campground, two golf courses, three disc golf courses and more than 30 kilometres of multi-purpose trails.

Ken Vein was the city engineer for Grand Forks, N.D., during the flood in 1997. The dikes and levees behind him cost more than $400 million to build. (Warren Kay)

Back on the farm south of Fargo, Ness says he knows flooding needs to be mitigated along the Red River, he just thinks there is a better way to do it that could impact fewer people. He points to the dike system in Grand Forks as a possible example.

Rocky Schneider, spokesperson for the diversion authority, says while Grand Forks is a great example of flood mitigation, Fargo is not in a position to do the same thing.

""Frankly, what works in Grand Forks, or works in Winnipeg, may not work somewhere very close by.""

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney says despite a few remaining hurdles, the diversion project is finally on the right track.

""Right now, we're in the best position we've ever been in,"" he said.

Ness says he's holding out hope that one of those last few hurdles can change the project's course. If not, he'll have to decide whether this project puts his family out of farming forever.

""I think it would be almost next to impossible, or is impossible, to recreate this."""

My great aunt almost got screwes by a realtor, he tryed selling her house 80k under market value to his son. Thank god my grandpa cought wind of it before it was finalized.",1.0,101.0,"A man with a disability says a realtor from a Royal LePage brokerage ""tricked"" him and his wife into selling their east end Toronto home and cost them tens of thousands of dollars in the process.

Harold Verge, 72, is blind. His wife also suffers from a series of debilitating health issues. Last month, they lost the home they owned for the past 24 years when it was sold, against their will, they say.

The agent, Vince Iannello, while not denying any of the specific allegations, says he has ""never wavered"" from caring for his clients. For its part, Royal LePage says it is investigating the Verges' case.

But the Verges say their ordeal began when Iannello, a realtor with Royal LePage Your Community Realty in Vaughan, offered to help the couple renew their two mortgages, according to Verge.

""When my wife was trying to read the paperwork, he kept saying, 'Don't read it, sign it, sign it,'"" Verge recalled Iannello telling her.

""We thought we were only signing to renew our mortgages.""

Days after the mortgages were renewed, the Verges say Iannello returned to their home and told them it was going to be sold. CBC News has reviewed the mortgage renewal documents, both in the Verges' home and at their lawyer's office.

""He said he's going to sell our house whether we like it or not, because we're not allowed to own our house after you're 65 years old,"" Verge said.

""He said he had to do his part to sell it.""

There are no laws in Canada preventing seniors from owning property.

""I think he tricked us into it. My wife feels the same way. He tricked us,"" Verge said about listing the home for sale.

Iannello also allegedly told the couple his wife had just given birth to a third child, and that the realtor needed money, according to Verge.

Last month, the Verges moved into a small rented bungalow several kilometres away after their home was sold.

""I wake up in the middle of the night tormented and in fear,"" Verge told CBC News.

""What's going to happen next?"" he said, pointing to stacks of boxes piled high in the living room of the rented bungalow.

""I'm afraid if I unpack everything, and the landlord says you have to get out, you have to move, we've got to worry about packing and moving again,"" he said.

Iannello paid their first and last months' rent once their home was sold.

Vince Iannello is a real estate agent with Royal LePage Your Community In brokerage.

'They were fooled,' lawyer says

Verge and his wife Florence bought their 2.5-storey, semi-detached home at 42 Connaught Ave, in the Queen Street East and Greenwood Avenue area, in 1995.

The couple was in good standing financially, despite their modest incomes and their two mortgages.

Harold Verge weaves cane to repair seats and backrests on antique chairs. Florence Verge retired after working 30 years at a McDonald's restaurant.

Iannello declined to answer numerous questions from CBC News. In an emailed statement he said he wasn't able to due to legal reasons.

""I was surprised to be contacted by the CBC regarding these allegations,"" he wrote.

Commitment to Verges 'is genuine,' Iannello says

""My commitment to the Verges is genuine and I am disappointed that no further details can be provided by me at this time due to the potential for litigation,"" his email reads.

The Verges, with the help of a concerned friend, have since hired a lawyer to look into the situation.

""They were fooled,"" Charles Wagman, the Verges' lawyer, told CBC News.

""There was pressure because of the idea they had to sell, that they weren't entitled at law to own property anymore. That's what the Verges say motivated them to sell.""

Wagman says the home was also sold for below market value.

""It appears the property was grossly undersold.""

In a complaint to the brokerage, Wagman accuses Iannello of negligence, noting the realtor didn't list the Verges' home on the Multiple Listing Service. The website is widely used by realtors to list homes for sale and attract a larger pool of potential buyers.

Instead, Iannello sent an email to other agents at the Royal LePage Your Community Realty brokerage letting them know the Verge's home was available.

CBC News obtained a copy of the email. In it, Iannello claimed the Verges were ""motivated sellers.""

""They were the opposite of motivated sellers. They didn't want to sell,"" said Wagman.

House sold for less than any other on the street recently

Nine days after being listed, the Verges' home was sold with the help of one of Iannello's colleagues at Royal LePage Your Community Realty.

Realtor Leslie-Jane Patterson's clients bought the Verges' home for $675 000.

In an email that Patterson wrote to another potential buyer, she noted the home had been appraised at $750 000. She described the home as being in ""rough shape"" but added it had upgraded hydro service, water systems and a newer furnace.

Patterson described the Verges' home as an ""opportunity"" and told her client, two other 2.5 storey, semi-detached homes on the same street recently sold for $880 000 and $886 000 each.

""I have zero vested interest in this property other than helping these poor souls that appear to be being taken advantage of. I had no idea of the situation when I took my investors through the property today — if anything I was told not to engage in conversing with the vendor, oops!!!"" she wrote in the email.

It's not clear who Patterson believed was taking advantage of the Verges.

She declined to respond to specific questions from CBC News, and hung up when reached by phone.

In a later email to CBC News, she provided no specifics about the situation.

""Nothing brings me more joy than helping my clients successfully navigate their home sales and purchases. I take great pride and care in my work. I respect the privacy of my clients and it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any additional manner,"" she wrote.

Patterson, Iannello and the brokerage pocketed more than $33 000 in commissions from the sale.

In his email, Iannello suggested he did nothing wrong.

""I have never wavered from always caring about the well being of my clients. Until this is resolved, I will not have an opportunity to discuss this further,"" he wrote.

'Looking into the details' of Verges' case, Royal LePage says

Representatives from Royal LePage's corporate head office also declined to answer any specific questions about the home sale.

In an emailed statement, the company's director of communications suggested the matter is being investigated.

""Royal LePage's brand is built on integrity, a strong commitment to the community and the best interests of consumers,"" Sarah Louise Gardiner wrote.

""Our brokerages are independently owned and operated and we are looking into the details of this specific situation. We cannot discuss it further at this time.""



"
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/americans-diabetes-cross-canada-border-insulin-1.5125988,I already answered  that.,1.0,55.0,"Quinn Nystrom was expecting the worst.

She thought the U.S. Border Patrol would want to search her car. That she would be bombarded with questions. That they would demand she show her prescription for insulin.

Worst of all, she was worried they would confiscate the small, cold vials of a life-saving drug that she had crossed the border to buy at a pharmacy in Fort Frances, Ont.

But it didn't happen. Not for Nystrom, not for anyone in her small group from Minnesota — calling themselves the Caravan to Canada — who were on a mission last weekend to buy insulin at one-tenth the price of what it's listed in the United States.

As the cost of insulin continues to skyrocket in the U.S., where pharmaceutical companies can dictate the price, people are making the trek north as an alternative to paying thousands of dollars to stay alive.

The small group drove five hours from Minnesota to Ontario to buy insulin at one-tenth the cost. (Rachel Nystrom)

Insulin and many other drugs cost less in Canada, thanks to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, a federal agency that establishes the maximum price that can be charged for patented drugs.

So while an influx of Americans crossing the border to buy insulin won't affect the price, it could hurt supply in Canada.

""There absolutely is some degree of risk,"" said Barry Power, director of therapeutic content with the Canadian Pharmacists Association.

""If you look at the disparity in the populations, a small percentage of Americans coming to Canada is a disproportionate increase for services and supplies that are earmarked for Canada.""

For Americans, it's hardly a long-term solution. For some, it's the only option.

And for others, it's already too late.

Nicole Smith-Holt, also from Minnesota, joined last weekend's Caravan to Canada. Her son, Alec Smith, died in June 2017 from diabetes complications. She said he had been rationing his insulin when he couldn't afford to buy more.

""Mine was a symbolic fight, and going to see how easy and accessible and affordable it is at a pharmacy in Canada,"" she said. ""If I had known about this in 2017, I would have made that trip in 2017 and been able to save his life.""

'Desperate measures'

Nystrom, who has Type 1 diabetes, requires insulin to stay alive. She is on a type of fast-acting insulin called NovoLog, which costs about $300 US a vial. The Canadian equivalent, NovoRapid, is about $30 per vial. She was shocked to learn about the price difference.

""I almost felt walking out of that pharmacy like I was robbing the pharmacy. I just couldn't believe it,"" she said.

But border towns across Canada have seen Americans coming to buy medication for years.

The Guardian Johnson Drug Store in Perth-Andover, N.B., sits just shy of seven kilometres east of the U.S. border. Pharmacist Jill MacIntosh said the store has about 10 patients who come regularly from the U.S.

""We see probably at least one person a week,"" she said.

Dr. Seema Nagpal, vice-president of science and policy with Diabetes Canada, said her organization is paying attention to the cross-border traffic and potential insulin shortfalls.

""We try to keep our ear to the ground and hear as early as we can if that is becoming a problem, but we just haven't heard that yet.""

Nagpal said there are major health risks for people who can't afford to pay for their insulin.

""When a person doesn't have access to treatment that they need in order to sustain their life and to have a future, absolutely I understand there would be desperate measures in order to maintain their health,"" she said.

But she said Canadians also struggle to pay for their insulin.

""Many people are forced to make choices about whether they pay rent, whether they put certain foods on the table versus filling their prescriptions,"" she said, adding Diabetes Canada hears about insulin rationing in Canada, as well.

Pharmacists in both Canada and the U.S. say Americans coming north for cheaper insulin isn't a solution to the problem. (Reed Saxon/The Associated Press)

How long a vial of insulin lasts depends on how much a person takes. It could be anywhere from a week to a month.

Right now, insulin isn't available as a generic drug in the U.S., because pharmaceutical companies have made small improvements to insulin over the years to keep it under patent.

Nystrom has health insurance in Minnesota through the Affordable Care Act. But she's on what she calls a high-deductible plan: She pays $370 US a month for the plan itself, but has to pay a $7,800 US deductible before her plan will cover her insulin.

But not everyone in the U.S. has insurance, or is able to get it.

Smith-Holt said before her son died, he had just turned 26, which meant he was no longer eligible to stay on her insurance plan as of June 1, 2017.

On June 22, he went to the pharmacy to get more insulin. He was told it would cost $1,300 US. His body was found June 27.

""We are assuming he was hoping that what he had left he could stretch until payday,"" Smith-Holt said. ""He was just three days short of that payday when he passed away.""

High cost of insurance

While there are programs that exist for people over 65 or low-income families, the only other options in the U.S. are coverage through work or to buy it out of pocket.

Lija Greenseid, who organized the Caravan to Canada, lives in St. Paul, Minn. Her 13-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes and she and her husband buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

Last year, she said they spent $13,000 US just to obtain health insurance — and then $14,000 US out of pocket before her daughter's insulin was covered.

""It's a huge amount of money for us. Because of that, we didn't put any money into our kids' college savings accounts or put anything into retirement for the year. We really just had to pay our health-care bills,"" Greenseid said.

""So now you can see why we do crazy things like go across the border and buy insulin.""

Quinn Nystrom holds the insulin she bought on her trip to Canada. (Submitted by Quinn Nystrom)

Their fears around crossing the border come from confusion and uncertainty about what's allowed to be brought back into the U.S.

The U.S. Border Patrol declined to answer questions directly and referred CBC News to its website and to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The Border Patrol website says Americans travelling with prescription medication should have it in its original containers, have a copy of the prescription on hand and carry only personal-use quantities, which is a 90-day supply. It was unclear whether the same rules apply to medication bought outside the country.

The FDA did not reply by deadline for this story.

Len Saunders, an immigration lawyer in Blaine, Wash., on the border with Surrey, B.C., said he's never seen issues with bringing back medication as long as it's not a controlled substance.

""I don't think Americans care about people bringing insulin back to the U.S.,"" he said.

'They're a national embarrassment'

But crossing the border isn't an option for everyone.

""I don't think it's a long-term solution. And I also think it's sort of a cop-out for the U.S. government,"" Nystrom said.

""They want to say what a sophisticated country they are, how advanced they are, how they're one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and to me they're a national embarrassment and they are not taking care of their citizens.""

In February, the American Pharmacists Association and the Canadian Pharmacists Association issued a joint statement warning that drug importation policies could put patients at risk.

Power, with the Canadian association, said they wanted to highlight that crossing the border to get ""cheaper drugs"" from Canada is not a solution to problems in the U.S.

""They need to work on addressing the root causes that are causing the price disparities and making Americans take extreme measures to go outside the country to get their medication,"" he said.

Dr. LaShawn McIver agrees. The senior vice-president of government affairs and advocacy with the American Diabetes Association said 39 per cent of Americans saw the cost of their insulin increase in the last year.

""If people are travelling to other countries because they can't afford their insulin, then that's a problem,"" said McIver.

She said the U.S. federal health agency is looking at importing lower-cost drugs from other countries. But the American Diabetes Association wants to see changes at home so that insulin is more affordable.

She said the association is working with Congress to find solutions, and is calling for price transparency laws.

The Caravan to Canada drove five hours to the border. The caravan's hashtag, #Insulin4all, is seen on the back of one of the cars. (Quinn Nystrom)

While everyone agrees crossing the border isn't a sustainable option, it's likely to continue.

Nystrom said she knows of a group from Michigan that drove up to Canada on Thursday. She's planning another trip in June.

Greenseid wants to rally state politicians in Minnesota to sponsor a bus to bring people to Canada to buy insulin.

""As a mom, I do this lovingly for my child, but I really want to work for change so that it's easier for her when she gets older,"" Greenseid said. ""Because it's just too expensive.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,that isn't how laws or rights work,0.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/walk-for-water-winnipeg-1.5131285,The amount of people who think that all FN don't pay taxes at all is staggering,4.0,109.0,"Over a thousand people poured into the streets of downtown Winnipeg Friday to bring attention to the dozens of First Nations across Canada currently under boil water advisories.

Roughly 1,100 people, including more than 800 students from the Seven Oaks School Division, took part, organizers estimate.

Carrying signs, the demonstrators walked from city hall down Main Street to Portage Avenue, and then up Memorial Boulevard, before ending at the Manitoba Legislative Building.

Eric Jasysyn helped organize the walk and hoped to get the attention of politicians.

""The Indigenous communities have been suffering for so long and it's time to start seeing change,"" said Jasysyn, a Grade 12 student from Seven Oaks Met School.

""We want to make sure everyone understands that water is a basic human right and everyone deserves access to clean water.""

Jasysyn points specifically to the situation at Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, which provides Winnipeg with its drinking water, yet doesn't have a water treatment facility and has been under a years-long boil water advisory.

""It is time to start seeing change and it's time to start getting them the water that they deserve,"" he said.

""We want to start getting people hearing our voices.""

According to Indigenous Services Canada, 57 First Nations across Canada were under long-term drinking water advisories, including four in Manitoba, as of April 27.

Indigenous Services Canada has set a date of March 2021 to have all long-term water advisories lifted on Canadian First Nations, and says 85 of the advisories have been lifted since November 2015.

""There are communities across Canada that don't have access to clean drinking water — that's a big problem.""

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

Mounties track down man who waited in line just for 'honour' of standing beside officers

Surrey RCMP want to give the man, who waited 20 minutes in Vaisakhi photo booth line, a copy of their picture

Surrey RCMP say they've identified the man standing between the two officers in this photo, and plan to meet up with him to give him a copy. (Amandeep Takhar)

Mounties say they've tracked down a man who waited nearly half an hour in line for a quick turn at the RCMP's photo booth, just for the ""honour"" of standing next to two RCMP officers.

Officers set up their station at the Vaisakhi parade in Surrey, B.C., on April 20, on standby to chat and take photos with anyone who came by. About half a million people marched through the city for the festivities and a line of people waiting to take a photo with two RCMP officers in their red serges grew long.

When the man's turn came, he said he didn't have a camera. Amandeep Takhar, who was volunteering at the booth, said the man told him ""he just wanted the honour of standing alongside two Surrey RCMP members.""

Takhar, 28, took a photo on his personal phone anyway, showing the man dressed in a neat blue windbreaker between the officers with his hands resting on his cane.

""When he came down, I asked him in Punjabi if there's anywhere I could send it to, if he had a phone number or an email and he said that he didn't. He just mentioned, 'I just wanted to be up there and take a picture with them. They do a lot to keep us safe,'"" said Takhar, who's been volunteering with the RCMP's communities program for two years.

""He reminded me of my own grandfather. Such a sweet, calm guy. Soft-spoken gentleman.""

Takhar posted the photo on Twitter, hoping to track down the man's family.

On Tuesday afternoon, Surrey RCMP said they'd identified the man, and he'll visit the detachment soon to receive a copy of his photo."

The provincial losses report also revealed a contract manager was given an 18-month sentence after stealing rent receipts and submitting false expense claims totaling about $114,000 from the Saskatchewan Housing Corporation.

A 2016-17 fourth quarter report found a preliminary loss of about $2,000 due to the contract manager stealing rent receipts and submitting false expense claims. A further investigation revealed the loss was much higher.

Then, months after providing an intricate account of his own voter fraud, he tried to make the whole thing go away.

So far, he's been mostly successful.

In January 2017, an Indigenous politician swore on the record that he traded money for votes during the recent election of chief and council on the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation. Then he tried to take it all back. The CBC iTeam Geoff Leo investigates the allegation. 11:30

In January 2017, the Indigenous politician swore on the record that he traded money for votes during the recent election of chief and council on the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation, which is about 350 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon. He offered bank records to prove it.

I do verily believe that they misappropriated funds from Canoe Lake Cree First Nation. They used these misappropriated funds to purchase votes and influence electors. - Larry Iron's affidavit

Larry's affidavit, combined with almost three full bankers boxes of documents filed in federal court, paint a picture of an elaborate and extensive vote-buying scheme.

It's all included in an application filed by activists from the First Nation, attempting to overturn the results of the Dec. 16, 2016 election.

They alleged that some candidates, ""provided money, employment, contracts, cigarettes, gasoline and other valuable consideration to electors and persons that have influence on electors in exchange for the vote of electors.""

Larry was one of those activists. Larry was also one of those candidates. And his allegations were the backbone of the case.

A detailed affidavit

Larry swore an affidavit just weeks after the election saying it had been influenced by a vote-buying scheme orchestrated by the chief and a couple of councillors.

""I do verily believe that they misappropriated funds from Canoe Lake Cree First Nation,"" Larry wrote. ""They used these misappropriated funds to purchase votes and influence electors.""

Larry's 34-page affidavit says he knew about the plan because he was an active participant. It provides a detailed description of how he and several others used public money to pay band members to vote for a slate of candidates — a slate that included Larry.

The affidavit lays out who Larry paid, how much and on which dates. He provided bank records to back up some of his claims.

None of the claims in the affidavit have been tested in court.

Larry seen as 'incriminating himself'

Leonard Iron, no relation, was one of the activists who joined with Larry in the attempt to overturn the election.

Leonard says he was stunned by the detailed evidence Larry provided and by Larry's willingness to risk being prosecuted.

Leonard Iron is one of the Canoe Lake activists who joined with Larry in an effort to overturn the results of the Dec. 2016 election. (Submitted by Leonard Iron)

According to an affidavit filed by Leonard, Larry told the activists he had been warned by his lawyer, ""that what he, Larry Iron, had disclosed contained criminal conduct above and beyond that of vote buying, that he was implicated, that a criminal investigation was a likely event, and that he would be subject to the same legal consequences as others he was accusing if those matters were proven in court.""

Under the First Nations Elections Act, the activists' only option was to take the matter to court.

Larry's decision to proceed gave Leonard and the other activists great confidence.

""We convinced ourselves that if Larry Iron was willing to swear an affidavit in which he would be incriminating himself he could not possibly back out after that,"" said Leonard.

Leonard and the other activists turned out to be wrong about that.

Larry bails out

Six months later, Larry bailed on the case, requesting his affidavit be withdrawn. In a letter on the court file, Larry said he had reached an agreement with the Chief to enact sweeping reforms on reserve.

In his affidavit, Leonard said Larry showed up at a band meeting at the end of June 2017 to announce he was withdrawing the appeal of the election. Until that point, Larry had been funding the effort.

In addition, Leonard wrote that Larry, ""apparently speaking on behalf of the respondents (the chief and some councillors), began offering me employment with the First Nation if I agreed to drop the appeal.""

""Larry Iron advised me that 'You might as well accept. You won't get anywhere without my affidavit anyway.' ""

Leonard refused.

""We wanted this case to continue, especially after we obtained all those documents,"" Leonard said. ""It's insane what they were doing.""

For me the case is closed and it's an old story. - Larry Iron

The case collapsed. Leonard said neither the RCMP nor the federal government would do anything to help.

In a letter to Leonard, the RCMP said the ""affidavit serves only as an unsubstantiated allegation,"" and said the banking records weren't useful because, ""documents compelled during a civil proceeding such as this, cannot be used in a criminal proceeding against an individual.""

As for the federal government, Leonard said they've been no help either, opting to refer Leonard to the courts or back to the chief and council. He said he's baffled that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is so eager to support democracy around the globe but not here in Canada.

""Why is this guy concerned about fair and even elections in Venezuela when he doesn't care about the same thing on reserves?"" Leonard asked. ""He's responsible for them and he doesn't do a damn thing about it.""

Earlier this month, CBC asked Larry for an interview about his affidavit and Leonard's allegations. He refused.

""For me the case is closed and it's an old story,"" Larry told CBC before hanging up.

Todd MacKay with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation said that he's heard allegations of voter fraud on First Nations in Saskatchewan for years, but that he's never seen a case with this much sworn evidence. He said his organization is working with the activists to help draw attention to the case.

Allegations of voter fraud in federal or provincial elections have resulted in aggressive investigations, but the Canoe Lake case has resulted in ""one huge collective shrug,"" McKay said.

He said that, given the seriousness of the allegations on Canoe Lake, ""the people there deserve answers and frankly all Canadians deserve answers because this shouldn't be happening anywhere in the world. And it absolutely can't be happening in Canada.""

Larry 'felt betrayed'

In his affidavit, Larry said he had worked with the Chief Francis Iron during the course of the December 2016 election campaign to pay voters to cast ballots for a slate of candidates that included Larry himself, who was running for council.

Elected office on Canoe Lake can be very profitable.

Chief Francis Iron, first elected in 2014, was paid $221,000 in salary and expenses in 2015/2016 to run a reserve of slightly more than 1,000 people, according to the federal government. Councillors were paid as much as $182,000 that same year.

Chief Francis was re-elected, but Larry lost.

According to the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation's Facebook page, Chief Francis Iron was sworn in on March 16, 2017. (Canoe Lake Cree First Nation/Facebook)

Larry was furious, according to Leonard.

""He was supposed to be elected because he was part of that conspiracy and then he felt betrayed by those people because he wasn't elected,"" Leonard told CBC.

Leonard's affidavit adds, ""his conscience was bothering him about the extent of vote-buying that had occurred, in which he was personally involved and that if he did not come forward, the corrupt activities he had witnessed would escalate.""

An affidavit filed in federal court by band member Margaret Couillonneur said ""[Larry] stated to me that he was 'going to get everybody' and that he was going to appeal the results of the election.""

Leonard wrote in his affidavit that, days after the election, Larry invited him and several other band members to a restaurant where he ""disclosed shocking information about his involvement in a vote buying conspiracy with enough details that it provided credibility to his claim that 'No one else had a chance of winning the election except the ones who ultimately won.""

Leonard and the other activists agreed to work with Larry to overturn the election.

Duelling explanations for payments to band members

In many cases, Chief Francis and another accused councillor Wilfred Iron, in their respective affidavits, seem to agree with Larry on the basic facts.

Chief Francis and Wilfred concede that in the days and weeks leading up to the December 16, 2016 vote they provided Larry with money to give to other band members.

The primary dispute centres on what the payments were for.

While Larry claims they were given in exchange for votes, Chief Francis and Wilfred deny that and offer a range of other explanations.

Unfortunately, it has been a common practice in elections of Canoe Lake Cree First Nation that candidates offer money or similar such matters in exchange for votes. - Larry Iron's affidavit

Marie Florence Yew, a Canoe Lake band councillor until the December election, filed an affidavit saying many payments described by Larry were not lawfully authorized.

Yew said that according to the Indian Act, any payments from band accounts must be authorized by band council.

""At no point in time were any of these directives referred to in the affidavit of Larry Amable Iron sworn January 7, 2017, discussed at a band council meeting,"" she wrote.

Under questioning by lawyers for the activists, Chief Francis conceded that some payments are made without a band council meeting.

""When emergencies come up, there's no time to call a meeting. You know that. Emergency comes up, family member's in hospital, what are we supposed to do? Oh,wait, I got to call a meeting. Can't say that,"" said Chief Francis.

He said in other cases, the payments were authorized by an impromptu phone meeting of a quorum of council.

However, he said in most cases payments from band accounts are authorized at a council meeting.

Timeline of alleged vote-buying

Late October 2016

The court application to overturn the election describes an October 2016 meeting between Chief Francis and Larry, when they discussed ""the prospect of working together to influence the election.""

Larry's affidavit says he asked Chief Francis whether there was sufficient funding and the chief told him not to be concerned about money, ""as he had everything set up and that he had 'access.' Francis Xavier Iron then indicated that 'Whatever it takes, I need to get back into power.' ""

Larry's affidavit says adequate funding is crucial to elections on the First Nation.

""Unfortunately, it has been a common practice in elections of Canoe Lake Cree First Nation that candidates offer money or similar such matters in exchange for votes, or that electors demand the same in exchange for their votes.""

The affidavit claims that Chief Francis offered Larry and two influential female band members, Margaret Coulineur and Malvina Iron, a series of payments between $1,000 and $2,500 in exchange for their assistance and support.

""Francis Xavier Iron then indicated that if he was elected, there would be a further $5,000 in cash paid to each of us, and if he was 'very successful' that a 'bonus' would also be paid.""

November 3, 2016

In his affidavit, Chief Francis confirms that on November 3, 2016, he met with Larry, Margaret and Malvina, ""to formally ask them for their support in the upcoming … election.""

He also confirmed he provided each of them with cheques for $1,500, but said ""no discussion occurred with respect to providing any of them with money to secure their support.""

In early November 2016, Larry Iron was provided a cheque from Chief Francis Iron. Larry says the money was paid in exchange for his support and assistance during the election. (Federal court)

The chief said he gave Larry the money as an act of charity.

""I often agree to assist band members with money and I agreed to assist Larry Amable Iron with assistance in the amount of $1,500.""

He said he gave Margaret and Malvina the money because they agreed to attend a meeting of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) on his behalf.

In their affidavits, both women agreed they were paid on November 3 and intended to go to the FSIN event. But they both said they were unable to attend.

However, under cross-examination, the lawyer for the activists pointed out that the FSIN event they agreed to attend happened on October 26 and 27.

Neither woman explained why they accepted payment to attend an event they didn't attend.

In the midst of that questioning, Margaret said wasn't feeling well and may need a break from the cross-examination.

""In case I have to, I got to. I can't sit here, and then I'm going to fall over. Then what?""

Both Margaret and Malvina claimed they did volunteer work in exchange for the money rather than repaying the band and they denied making any agreement to support Chief Francis or help him with the election.

November 30, 2016

According to Larry's affidavit, he and Chief Francis delivered a $1,000 cheque to a band member. The cheque had a notation that read, ""off reserve assistance.""

Chief Francis told the man ""if he voted for him that he would continue to support [him] in this way,'"" Larry alleged.

In his affidavit, Chief Francis confirmed the payment happened but said it was band assistance money to help the man pay for materials to fix his cabin.

December 2, 2016

Larry said in his affidavit that on December 2, Chief Francis informed him that $700 had been deposited into Larry's bank account. He said the Chief told him the money, ""was to set up a meeting for off-reserve members and to plan a supper"" hosted by the chief.

Larry's affidavit says Chief Francis Iron told him he was being provided $700 to organize a campaign supper for the chief. (Federal court)

December 5, 2016

Wilfred Iron, a councillor running for re-election, confirms in his own affidavit there was a dinner on December 5 and cheques were handed out.

He wrote that he paid three band members, who he named, $400 each. Documentation he attached shows the word ""donation"" beside each payment.

Wilfred's affidavit says at that meeting he ""received a large number of requests from urban band members seeking assistance from the band with money to pay bills, rent and or purchase groceries.""

He said these sorts of requests ""are a normal occurrence around the holiday season.""

""I specifically deny that any payments or assistance was provided to any band member for the purpose of securing their vote or to unlawfully influence their vote,"" Wilfred wrote.

December 6, 2016

Larry was sent by the chief to the First Nations Bank in Saskatoon, where Canoe Lake had its accounts, to pick up some cash and cheques for people as dictated by a directive prepared by the chief.

Larry says Chief Francis provided him a written list of cheques and cash he was instructed to pick up from the bank. (Federal court)

He wrote that he was surprised to see that Chief Francis was authorizing $4,000 cheques for certain council candidates given that the chief ""had previously told me that those persons were not campaigning with us.""

According to Larry's affidavit, the chief replied ""he had to ensure they all got $4,000 because they all knew about the financial transactions that had occurred… and that if any of them were not successful in the election that $4,000 would ensure their silence 'so they couldn't come after me if they lost in the election.' ""

In his affidavit, Chief Francis confirmed that he asked Larry to pick up and deliver the money but denied it was to buy votes. Instead, the chief said, the payments were for travel and honorariums.

In addition to cheques for council candidates, Larry was also instructed to pick up cheques for band members and deposit them into their accounts.

One of those people, Barry Opekokew, confirmed in an affidavit that a $1,000 cheque had been deposited into his account by Larry.

He said the money wasn't to buy his vote but instead was ""for financial assistance to attend Saskatoon for my father-in-law's medical treatment."" .

Larry said the chief also told him to pick up $6,000 cash from the bank ""to ensure that they had enough money to influence voters and in particular during the elders gathering.""

The band had arranged an elders gathering to be held in a Prince Albert hotel on December 6 to 8. The advanced poll was being held in the same hotel in the midst of that elders gathering.

Canoe Lake paid for the elders hotel and paid each of them $500 cash.

In an interview with CBC, Chief Francis said that money was to help pay for some extra elders who weren't pre-registered for the event.

""I understand it would make it look shady but it had nothing to do with giving money for the election they were just forgotten payments,"" said the chief.

During cross-examination Canoe Lake's interim manager, Rachel Iron, conceded that the December 2016 payments weren't entered into the band's general ledger until February 2017 — after the election appeal had been launched.

December 8, 2016

Larry said Chief Francis and Wilfred told him they were depositing another $750 in his bank account, ""which they told me was to be used by me to pay band members in exchange for their vote.""

In his affidavit, Wilfred said that money wasn't to buy votes but was to cover Larry's expenses travelling back and forth to the bank.

Larry said the chief also gave him an additional $900 cash and instructed him to provide it to three men in Meadow Lake with instructions to vote for a slate of candidates that included the chief and Larry. The chief denies this.

Larry said he spent most of this day at a hotel in Saskatoon where he witnessed a steady stream of band members meeting with Chief Francis and Wilfred. Larry said the chief ""informed me these band members were collecting cash payments for their votes.""

He said that on one occasion, Chief Francis and Wilfred were away so Larry paid two band members $100 dollars each, on direction from the chief.

Chief Francis said he wasn't at that hotel on that date ""nor did I hand out money to band members to secure their votes.""

December 9, 2016

Larry said the chief provided him $300 cash to pass on to a couple of named band members. The chief denies this.

In addition, Larry said the chief sent him an email transfer of $200 to provide to a female band member.

The chief confirms making that $200 payment but he denied the money was election related.

Instead he said it was an assistance payment made to Larry directly because of his ""inability to pay his basic bills.""

December 13, 2016

Larry's affidavit says the chief wanted to send another $2,500 to Larry ""for payments to various voters prior to the main poll on December 16.""

Larry said this time he expressed some reservation.

""I was concerned with the number of transfers that I was receiving and my inability to explain them. I refused to accept any further direct transfers,"" the affidavit says.

According to Larry's affidavit, Chief Francis suggested transferring money to Larry's son Keith Iron instead. Larry said the chief indicated that in the bands books, he would make it appear ""as payment in relation to work that Keith Iron had done.""

Keith's account received a transfer of $2,500.

In an affidavit, Keith confirms he received the money and passed most of it on to his father.

Larry's affidavit says this bank statement shows that Chief Francis Iron had $2,500 transferred to Larry's son Keith, which Keith then immediately transferred to Larry. (Federal court)

""My father confided in me that he had grown uncomfortable with so much money being transferred into his personal bank account from the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation without any documentation as to why such deposits were occurring,"" Keith said in his affidavit.

In his affidavit, Chief Francis said the payment was for work Keith had done on the Canoe Lake store.

However, Keith's affidavit says ""I did not perform any work or provide any other services nor had I agreed to perform work or provide services for the First Nation for which I should be paid.""

December 14 & 15, 2016

Larry said he went to the home of a band member where he delivered $100 cheques to five people, all of whom are named in the affidavit. Larry directed them to vote for a slate of candidates that included Chief Francis and himself.

Larry said he went back to that same home, delivering another eight $100 cheques and directing the band members who received them to vote for a slate of candidates that included Chief Francis and himself.

The chief's affidavit says ""this money was not provided for these alleged purposes.""

Several of the people alleged by Larry to have been paid in exchange for their vote filed affidavits denying having received any such payment.

December 16, 2016 - Election Day

Larry said the chief told him to pick up a female band member, give her $200 and ask her to pick up three men, who are named in the affidavit, from a neighbouring First Nation and bring them to a polling station.

The woman was to tell the men if they voted for the chief's slate of candidates he would give them $200 each.

Larry also claims the chief told the woman to fill up her tank at the band store and charge it to the First Nation's account.

Larry backs out, killing court case

In June 2017, many of the people who filed affidavits supporting or opposing the motion to overturn the election were cross-examined by lawyers.

Leonard says he was there for all of it and was very pleased with how it was going.

However, on the final day, Larry approached Leonard to say he was bailing out.

Leonard's affidavit says that's when Larry offered to get him a job if he also agreed to drop the case. Leonard refused.

On July 7, 2017, Larry wrote the lawyer representing him, requesting that his affidavit and those of his sons be withdrawn. ""We are requesting that the parties involved can no longer use our affidavits in this case.""

When reached by CBC earlier this month, Larry seemed to be under the impression that by sending that letter, the affidavit was no longer public.

""They were all taken out from the court system,"" Larry told CBC when reached by phone. ""There's no affidavits in there."" CBC pointed out that his affidavit is still on the public record in federal court.

Shortly after pulling out of the court case, Larry began campaigning for vice-chief at the Meadow Lake Tribal Council, the second-in-command for the organization, which represents nine northwest Saskatchewan First Nations.

Larry won the job in November 2017 after having received more support from the 49 appointed delegates than his closest competitor.

'A one time opportunity to deal with this issue'

In a July 2017 letter to the law society about the matter, Larry said he ended the court case because he had reached an agreement with the leadership of the First Nation to enact sweeping reforms.

""The community has been faced with this kind of behaviour for the last 20 years,"" he wrote. ""We now have a one time opportunity to deal with this issue head on with the community members and guaranteed this will never happen again in our election process.""

He claimed that in exchange for withdrawing his affidavit, ""Chief Francis along with his council have agreed to inact (sp) a advisory council and have allowed my team and complainants to be part of the process.""

He also claimed they agreed to develop and implement a new financial management act, an executive act and a financial audit committee.

When reached by phone earlier this month, Chief Francis denied any such agreement.

""There was no deal made between the band and Larry,"" said the chief. ""I'll leave it at that.""

When asked if he had made any of the reforms Larry claimed were coming, the chief provided a simple answer.

""No."""

The proposed Green New Deal is being endorsed by David Suzuki and 60 signatories — including the largest unions, youth leaders, Indigenous groups and environmental economists.

It’s been inspired by some U.S. Democrats’ call to shift jobs and the economy from fossil fuels to renewable energy and infrastructure.

And just as that American version has been called unworkable, unrealistic and even “socialist” by conservatives there, Canada’s nascent iteration will likely come under attack in the months leading up to this fall’s federal election.

That doesn’t deter Nayeli Jimenez, 28, a Vancouver-based member of the youth-led national climate group Our Time.

“We can’t afford not to do this,” the art director for a publishing house told Star Vancouver ahead of the plan’s unveiling Monday.

Jason Kenney’s Alberta election vow will not derail national carbon tax, says environment minister

Canada warming faster than the rest of the world, says Environment Canada

“We’re feeling an intense sense of emergency and anxiety because our futures are on the line.”

The Pact for a Green New Deal, according to its founding document, aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically — by half in the next decade. Its creators insist that by shifting spending and by protecting and retraining workers, governments can create a million jobs.

Details will be hammered out after a nationwide series of town halls, but four pillars have been set out for the framework: that it apply science in meeting the scale and urgency of the climate crisis; that it focus on job creation and ensure workers in oil-and-gas sectors receive retraining; that it ensure the transition is socially just and doesn’t hurt those at the bottom of the economic ladder; and that it respects Indigenous rights.

The essence of the plan is to focus on job creation, clean infrastructure such as transit systems, renovating buildings and boosting green technology development.

“We’re not asking for something radical — we’re asking for something that’s actually very rational,” Jimenez said. “It’s about moving investments from fossil fuels into clean infrastructure that will create far more jobs.”

The federal government estimates that Alberta’s oilsands employ 400,000 people directly and indirectly. And the country’s entire energy sector employs more than double that, or roughly 900,000 direct and indirect jobs.

Asked about concerns such a dramatic industrial proposal is unrealistic, Jimenez said it will actually save the country billions.

“You question how you’re going to pay for it, how you’re going to be able to pull it off,” she replied. “It’s a really valid question — but why aren’t we asking how much our inaction is going to cost us?”

According to energy economist Marc Eliesen — former president and CEO of Ontario Hydro (now Hydro One), BC Hydro and Manitoba Hydro — moving away from fossil fuels is both inevitable, and already happening amongst investors.

But, he warned in an interview Sunday, while “the transition has to take place, it has to be more than slogans.”

During his time as Ontario’s deputy minister of energy, Eliesen also sat on the board of director of Calgary-based Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil company which also runs the country’s largest biofuels plant and produces 111 megawatts of wind power.

He said when it comes to renewable energy, “the first to call the tune on this are investors themselves,” not governments. When told of the Canadian Green New Deal’s aims, he agreed it’s essential that workers be protected as the economy shifts.

“No one from economics’ ‘green school’ or investors in the oil industry are suggesting we stop producing what we’re producing,” Eliesen told the Star. “The transition is clearly not going to come immediately — you’ve got an oil worker who’s been working for decades, the retraining process for someone like that is going to take time, let’s be honest about that.

“There must be some support mechanisms for people undergoing retraining for new areas of generation electricity or transportation.”

The Green New Deal’s plan to substantially achieve that workforce shift, while investing billions in renewable energy and green infrastructure, is “quite frankly the only way to go,” Eliesen believes, as the oil sector heads toward what he called “an era of strangled investments” despite billions in government subsidies.

“In my judgment it’s not a cost, it’s an investment,” he explained. “Any efforts with regard to retraining or going into new areas of renewables can only be good, both from an economic point of view, and an environmental point of view.

“More and more banks and other institutions are switching towards renewable areas for their future energy development, and in the last three or four years major companies are pulling out of the oilsands. That trend is taking place everywhere.”

The original Pact for a Green New Deal has been championed by some Democrats south of the border, including Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been a lightning rod for conservatives.

The plan takes its title from U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt’s 1930s New Deal legislation, which lifted the country from the Great Depression through massive public works projects, employment programs and stricter financial controls.

While Canada’s version will undoubtedly be controversial, many appear sympathetic to the ideas behind it. A poll last month by Abacus Data found that 61 per cent of the survey’s 1,000 respondents said they either support or somewhat support such a proposal, described as “a massive government jobs program and investment in clean energy, green technology, and electrification.”

In another Abacus Data poll released Friday, 87 per cent of 15-to-30-year-olds said “solving climate change” was a serious issue — four-in-10 “extremely serious.”

The May 2 survey of 1,000 young people found the concern about the issue was “consistent across age, gender, education and income.” But the survey also found that six in 10 young people believe they “don’t have a say in what the government does,” 18 per cent of them believing that strongly. The older the youth, Abacus found, the “much more likely to feel disenfranchised.” (The survey used online panels and had a margin of error equivalent to 3.1 per cent).

Still, the deal might well be dismissed by politicians or many Canadians.

That’s what happened with Canada’s earlier Leap Manifesto. Backed by prominent activists and academics — and debated, though not adopted by the federal NDP due to intense internal divisions — it was one of the most controversial environmental proposals in the past decade and called for a complete revolution in Canada’s economy away from fossil fuels. The Leap Manifesto website has endorsed the proposed Green New Deal.

More than its American namesake, the Canadian deal’s bigger inspiration is Quebec’s Le Pacte, organizers said — a manifesto which has gathered 270,000 signatures to date. Le Pacte calls for a 50 per cent emissions cut by 2030, and requiring that all levels of government legislation pass a “test of their climate impacts.”

Even in some resource-dependent ridings of B.C., the “green new deal” catchphrase has seen buy-in from politicians. For instance, after Revelstoke, B.C., saw students join climate protests, Kootenay-Columbia MP Wayne Stetski, with the NDP, praised the youth’s message.

“We need a bold plan that reduces emissions while creating sustainable jobs for workers,” Stetski said on Friday in the House of Commons. “We can do this by committing to renewable energy, retrofitting homes, expanding public transit and investing in clean manufacturing.”

According to analysis of Hansard debate transcripts by the Star Vancouver, so far this year the phrases “climate change,” “greenhouse gases” or “global warming” have been uttered in the House of Commons by 103 members of Parliament, half of them Liberals, and nearly one-third by New Democrats.

By contrast, just 15 Conservative MPs have uttered any of those phrases this year so far — but over the same four months four times that amount, 60 Tory lawmakers, used the words “carbon tax.” (Three New Democrats and the Greens’ Elizabeth May used the phrase, but Liberals entirely avoided it).

The only MPs who have spoken of a “green new deal” in Parliament have been three from the NDP. May unsurprisingly joined the call for such a “transformative” plan.

The federal Liberal government maintains Canada will meet its target under the Paris Agreement to fight climate change, which is to reduce national emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. As of 2017, Canada’s emissions were two per cent below what they were in 2005, according to the national tally submitted this week to the United Nations.

To close that gap, Ottawa enforced a minimum carbon price across the country this year, which will rise from $20 per tonne of emissions to $50 per tonne in 2022. The federal government is also phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2030, when it aims for 90 per cent of electricity in Canada to come from emissions-free sources.

At the same time, the Liberal government has earmarked millions for green technology and infrastructure.

Earlier this month, federal scientists released a report that said Canada is warming at twice the global average because of climate change, and that action to reduce emissions can only mitigate the severity of the consequences, which are likely to include disappearing Arctic ice and permafrost, rising sea levels in coastal cities and more frequent floods, heat waves, summer water shortages and wildfires.

For Jimenez, who is originally from Mexico, climate change is more than an environmental issue, but one that will cause devastating damage to the world’s economy, harming the poor in the Southern Hemisphere the most.

“The effects of climate change don’t care if you can vote or not,” she said. “This election is so critical, because if we are to meet the target of cutting carbon emissions by half in 11 years, the people in power for the next four years will be in charge when that needs to happen.

“This election could be our last chance. Otherwise we won’t make it. We need to make sure it happens.”

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-working-with-harper-1.5128872,"I agree but if the government is withholding documents, as it was, *I’d* certainly consider that interference. Perhaps not direct, giving-orders interference but interference nonetheless.",7.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

We will often hire help locally, for things as simple as drivers, boat operators, wildlife monitoring, etc. So we get to spend a lot of time chatting with them, which is great. 

One gentleman who worked with us in Fort Good Hope was really proud of having sent his kids south for school. Because, if they stayed in town, they had no future besides sitting in front of the television dreaming of things they can't have. He was positively beaming with pride that they were still in school. 

Now there's a danger with extrapolating with anecdotes, as always, but this can be somewhat of an indicative story. If you stay in town, you have no hope for a future, so why go to school? If you leave town, you may have a future, but the quality of schooling is better elsewhere, so better to get your school out of town too. Couple with a general distaste for school (due to residential schools), and you have plummeting attendance. 

What I find ironic about it is that sending your kids south for school is essentially recreating the argument for residential schools. The difference being that it isn't the government forcing it, and without the spectre of abuse.",23.0,32.0,"School attendance in small Northwest Territories communities has declined steadily in the last 10 years, despite sweeping changes to the education system designed to improve attendance and student performance.

In the legislature on Thursday, Deh Cho MLA Michael Nadli gave figures from the education department that show the disparity in attendance at schools in small communities and schools in Yellowknife is increasing.

In 2008, average attendance at schools in small communities was 83 per cent. By 2013 it had dropped to 79 per cent. Last year students attended an average of only 75 per cent of the time.

""These low attendance rates, combined with other realities, like the need for many students to upgrade [after graduating high school] in order to pursue post-secondary education, tell me we're not doing an adequate job preparing our youth for the challenges life brings,"" Nadli said in the Legislative Assembly.

At the same time, school attendance in Yellowknife dropped slightly, from 91 per cent in 2008 to 89 per cent last year.

I am hoping that the minister in the next assembly will carry this forward because it is not OK that our children are not going to school.​​​​ - Caroline Cochrane, education minister

The minister of education said declining attendance is an issue education leaders are reluctant to talk about.

""Attendance rates are a huge concern. Everybody, in my opinion, has been blaming everybody else,"" said Caroline Cochrane in response to Nadli's questions.

""I brought it up at the education leaders meeting, which has all the [school board] chairs and superintendents from all of the regions ... I had to bring it up twice, because I think they're afraid of it.""

Cochrane said declining attendance is an issue everyone needs to tackle. But she said the education minister will not be meeting again with the board chairs and superintendents until after the October territorial election.

""I am hoping that the minister in the next assembly will carry this forward because it is not OK that our children are not going to school.""

In 2012 the Department of Education began developing its Education Renewal initiative, a comprehensive overhaul of the education system in an attempt to improve student success, particularly in small communities.

One of the issues it attempted to address was attendance. To emphasize the importance of attendance, the department pointed out that a student with 80 per cent attendance will miss the equivalent of one school day per week. If that continues through elementary school and middle school, the student will have missed the equivalent of two years of school by the time they reach Grade 10."

It's  the intelligent  thing to do. Oh ya, you elected Ford, so intelligence isn't your strong suit.",-7.0,70.0,"Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

The study out of Dalhousie University also found that 60 per cent of cannabis users continue to buy from the same supplier as they did before smoking pot became legal last year.

""The reason why they did that is for convenience, quality and most importantly price,"" lead author Sylvain Charlebois told CBC's Maritime Noon on Thursday.

""The price of cannabis in the black market is actually much lower, much more affordable than the legal cannabis.""

The study found that 20 per cent of Canadians say they're worried about being seen buying cannabis. (Brett Ruskin/CBC)

Charlebois said he believes when edibles become legal, it could actually continue to fuel the black market.

""The regulatory framework presented by Health Canada is so restrictive that it won't entice manufacturers in Canada to produce edibles,"" he said.

""If there is appetite to consume edibles — no pun — people will actually look for that product. And we may actually see more products being imported into Canada illegally to support that demand.""

Drop in legalization support

The study surveyed 1,051 Canadians over four days last month. The estimated margin of error is 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20. The aim was to compare attitudes before and after October 2018 legalization.

It found the number of Canadians in support of legalization in general fell by 19 per cent — and uncertainty about legalization rose by seven per cent. Only about six per cent of people reported starting using since legalization.

Of the 68 per cent of Canadians who were in favour of legalizing cannabis in 2017, 93 per cent of that group were willing to try an edible product. That dropped to 70 per cent in April.

""That's a significant drop,"" Charlebois said, adding it's probably for a number of different reasons — including media reports of specific incidents, such as when a four-year-old girl in Nova Scotia was hospitalized after accidentally ingesting cannabis-infused chocolate.

The study also found that Canadians are worried about edibles posing a greater risk to children (64 per cent) and pets (54 per cent).

Of those surveyed, 20 per cent said while they don't use cannabis now, they might consider edibles once they become legal. (Shutterstock / Pong Pong)

Charlebois said he believes Health Canada has been focusing on mitigating the risk of cannabis products and not actually educating people.

""We figured out that Canadians are mostly cannabinoid illiterate,"" he said.

People are also concerned about privacy: almost half said they're uncertain about their co-workers knowing they use cannabis recreationally.

The study also found edibles carry less stigma than other forms of cannabis, and 20 per cent of respondents said while they don't use cannabis now, they might consider edibles once they become legal.

Charlebois said in Colorado, where marijuana is also legal, 50 per cent of all sales are edibles.

""The edible market in particular really has got a lot of people to consume cannabis, when really they didn't when only the dry stuff was legal. So we are expecting that to happen in Canada as well,"" he said.

While stigma wasn't something addressed in the 2017 study, Charlebois said the most recent findings suggest more than half of people believe retail facilities should be kept out of residential neighbourhoods. Less than 20 per cent said they're worried about being seen buying cannabis.

""The stigma was not as high or as strong as we thought it would be. However we have a long way to go from seeing cannabis become socially normalized in Canada,"" Charlebois said.

""And with restrictions, and in particular restrictions affecting edibles, that process may take much longer than expected."""

Or is 4 years also too short?,6.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

&gt; A St. John's man accused of possessing child pornography in an unusual case involving what's been described as a child sex doll has been found not guilty.

&gt; The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been **the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll**.


Well..... he was the first in that!",13.0,84.0,"A St. John's man accused of possessing child pornography in an unusual case involving what's been described as a child sex doll has been found not guilty.

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced in his fall economic update that the federal government would make $600 million in tax credits and incentives available to selected media outlets over the next five years.

An independent panel of experts was to be tasked with naming the eligible news organizations and assisting the government in implementing the measures.

""Today, we are reaching another milestone toward the implementation of these tax measures that aim to support Canadian journalism and journalism in under-served communities,"" said Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez.

The eight associations that have been asked to select a representative to sit on the independent panel by the middle of June are: News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

According to a statement released by Rodriguez's office, the panel members will be expected to consult with third parties and industry stakeholders before reporting back to the minister's office by late July.

In his fall update, Morneau announced some details of the $600 million program to help Canada's news media organizations — many of which have been struggling with diminishing revenue and falling readership numbers.

Under the program, news media organizations are eligible for refundable tax credits, a non-refundable tax credit for subscriptions to Canadian digital news and access to charitable tax incentives for not-for-profit journalism.

Rodriguez also named the seven organizations representing different segments of the news media which will be responsible for administering an additional fund of $50 million over five years to help regional media outlets.

The seven local organizations are: News Media Canada, Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspapers Association, National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, Community Radio Fund of Canada, the Canadian Association of Community Television Users and Stations, and the Fédération des télévisions communautaires autonomes du Québec."

Bernier has so far failed to parlay the significant political capital he had accumulated as a CPC leadership front-runner into a lasting electoral down payment for his People’s Party. If anything, he has depleted that capital.

Two years ago, one in two Conservative members supported Bernier’s bid to succeed Stephen Harper. For 12 of the 13 ballots it took to declare a winner, the leadership was his to lose.

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Liberals, Trudeau hit new low but poll suggests surging Tory support is soft

Maxime Bernier fails to gain momentum in Conservative territory

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

Since Bernier set out on his own last summer, Scheer’s Conservatives have vaulted to first place in voting intentions. Over the first quarter of this year, they raised more money than the ruling Liberals. Over the same period, Scheer’s personal ratings have improved while Bernier’s star has faded.

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is defending a decision to give a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservative Party a role in determining which news organizations are eligible for government funding.

Eight Canadian organizations will select representatives to sit on an advisory panel that will decide how the government should dole out $600-million media support fund, the government announced Wednesday.

They are News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

Unifor — a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservatives under both Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer — represents more than 12,000 journalists and media workers in Canada.

In a statement posted to Facebook, Unifor said critics are mischaracterizing its role on the panel. The union says it will help define the criteria through which the funds will be allocated, but won't be directly involved in deciding who gets the money.

""There is a lot at stake as we work to protect and preserve our news industry in Canada and after years of discussion we finally have a path forward,"" the union said.

As It Happens has reached out to Unifor for comment.

Rodriguez spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the new panel. Here is part of their conversation.

I don't know if you had a chance to read Chris Selley at the National Post ... who says that that your putting Unifor on this panel is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. How do you respond?

We chose different organizations that represent journalists and different media across the country with different regions being represented, both official languages, the ethnic press.

We wanted to make sure that it was representative of the industry, and that's the reason why they're all there.

Why Unifor?

It represents thousands of employees from the news sector.

But it also represents a very, very strong bias, doesn't it? Because Unifor has made it quite clear that they call themselves ""the resistance."" They have put out publicity. I'm sure you've seen their publicity: ""The resistance: Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" If you want to have a panel that appears to be unbiased, how does that help you?

This is Andrew Scheer's opinion, and ...

Excuse me. No, no. This is not Andrew Scheer's opinion. I'm looking at a picture put out. This is Unifor Canada's picture.

We're talking about professionals, which is the case of all the groups there are on this list.

And the reason why we wanted to intervene is because professional journalism is one of the pillars of democracy. And the Conservatives may think that, ""Well, you know what? We shouldn't do anything and then let them all die.""

On the contrary, we're saying, ""No, we have to be there to support them with one clear principle — to respect the freedom and independence of the press.""

Unifor posted this image in a November 2018 tweet that read: 'Unifor’s National Executive Board started planning for the federal election today @AndrewScheer #canlab #canpoli.' (@UniforTheUnion/Twitter)

That's not the issue here. The issue is that you said you were going to put together a panel, an advisory panel, to decide who is going to get the funds, the $600 million worth of support to the media in this country, and that you would have an unbiased and an independent panel.

Yes, which is the case.

Mr. Rodriguez, have you not seen the publicity that Unifor is putting out calling themselves ""the resistance"" and saying, ""Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" Have you not seen that?

I know what you're talking about.

The Conservatives are saying that Unifor, any people working or any journalists, can be bought by this program, which is not the case, and I think it's an insult to professional journalists that build their career on integrity and on independence and on professionalism.

We're talking about the people on the panel. We're not talking about the journalists who might be benefiting from these funds. We saw that Unifor, it was quite partisan during the 2015 election campaign, that they put out attack ads against Stephen Harper's Conservatives, which surely helped you get elected. So, again, we're back to this problem of an appearance of bias. That if you have, if you are giving this position to Unifor, to the union, to decide who is going to get this funding, when it's an organization that has clearly come out ... going against your political enemies, that's a problem, isn't it?

This is repeating what Andrew Scheer is saying. And, again, I have to disagree with you, because if you look at the role the associations are playing, the role ... the journalists are playing, they're there to ask the tough questions — just exactly like what you're doing.

And also, this proves my point that we need that type of journalism of tough questions. And maybe the Conservatives, they don't want to hear those questions, but I think they're absolutely necessary in our democracy. So that's why the panel is in place. That's why we're moving forward.

But you've asked this panel to help decide who is a proper journalist and what's a proper news outlet and who is worthy of these funds. And who you've put on the panel that gets to decide that an organization that has a very, very strong, very partisan political statement.

But you keep repeating the same thing.

Because I'm not getting a very good answer from you.

I am answering your question and I'm saying that it's a panel with different people there from different sides of the industry, all representing professional journalists.

I guess what I'm trying to get to ... is that you want people to trust this fund, and Canadians want journalism they can trust. They want to believe that it's unbiased. But if the critics of your fund have always raised the alarm about any possible bias, that's why you wanted to have an independent panel. But haven't you just walked into that trap?

No, these panels represent people from all sides of industry. It represents work as a journalist, it represents the owners, it represents francophones, anglophones, the different regions, the ethnic media. It represents everybody.

And you don't think that there is a bias here, or a perception of bias, if you have as one of your panel members — and I know I'm asking you this once again, and I apologize for that, but I still haven't got a clear answer — do you not think that this is a problem of bias?

But I did answer your question.

You don't think that there's any bias on the part of Unifor, that Unifor doesn't have a political agenda?

No, you're saying that the journalists they represent have their own agenda.

No, no, I'm not saying that.

Yes, you're saying that.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm not. The panel you put together has Unifor as one of its members. And the question is that an organization that is clearly partisan and anti-Conservative, and have made that very clear, we're asking if that's an appropriate party to have on this panel?

We're saying that we need people from all walks of life. In this case ... people that represent the workers, the employers, the regions, the official languages and all of that to be represented there to make sure that this panel represents all of them, and that it takes neutral decisions on professional journalism.

Because we need professional journalism in our society. You're there to ask the tough questions. Again, that's exactly what you're doing and this is what we need.

&gt;**National Academy of Sciences-Royal Society Report**

&gt;A joint report from the UK Royal Society and **the US National Academy of Sciences in February 2014 said that there is no ""pause""** in climate change and that the temporary and short-term slowdown in the rate of increase in average global surface temperatures in the non-polar regions is likely to start accelerating again in the near future. ""Globally averaged surface temperature has slowed down. I wouldn’t say it's paused. **It depends on the datasets you look at. If you look at datasets that include the Arctic, it is clear that global temperatures are still increasing,**"" said Tim Palmer, a co-author of the report and a professor at University of Oxford.[90][91] 

&gt;**World Meteorological Organisation climate report**

&gt;When announcing the annual World Meteorological Organisation climate report in March 2014,[92] **the WMO secretary-general Michel Jarraud said that there had been no pause**, with 2013 continuing a long-term warming trend showing ""no standstill in global warming"". **2013 had been the sixth-warmest year on record**, and 13 of the 14 warmest years on record had occurred since the start of 2000.[93] He said that ""**The warming of our oceans has accelerated, and at lower depths. More than 90 percent of the excess energy trapped by greenhouse gases is stored in the oceans.**""[94]

&gt;**The 2013 annual report stated that ""While the rate at which surface air temperatures are rising has slowed in recent years, heat continues to be trapped in the Earth system, mostly as increased ocean heat content.** About 93 percent of the excess heat trapped in the Earth system between 1971 and 2010 was taken up by the ocean."" From 2000 to 2013 the oceans had gained around three times as much heat as in the preceding 20 years, and while before 2000 most of the heat had been trapped between the sea surface and 700 metres' (0.43 mi) depth, from 2000 to 2013 most heat had been stored between 700 and 2,000 metres' (2,300 and 6,600 ft) depth. It proposed this could be due to changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation around the tropical Pacific Ocean, interacting with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.[95]

Thawing permafrost — an occurrence raising ""alarm bells"" in Canada's Arctic — is threatening to sweep away the local cemetery in an N.W.T. community, located on the shores of the Arctic Ocean.

""If the water keeps coming and coming, we're going to be exposing the graves,"" Tuktoyaktuk Mayor Merven Gruben told The Current's guest host Matt Galloway.

""A thing that's crossed our mind, of course, is relocation of the cemetery, but you know, who wants to do that? The cemetery's been there forever and there's a lot of unmarked graves.""

A study published last week in the journal Nature shows permafrost is thawing much faster than believed in some areas of Canada's Arctic. Researchers have found several metres of soil can destabilize in days versus a few centimetres thawing a year.

""Everything we hear about in the public and the media about trying to keep climate change under wraps — none of this includes abrupt permafrost thaw,"" said Merritt Turetsky, the report's lead researcher, adding that researchers are trying to raise ""alarm bells"" within the broader scientific community about it.

""This is an issue that we're only going to be hearing more about across Canada,"" she said.

It's happening so fast that the collapsing land is swallowing up scientific equipment. In other cases, it's causing landslides and flooding forests.

In Iqaluit, the foundation of the Arctic Winter Games arena required over $2 million in repairs in the early 2000s because permafrost made it unstable. In another Nunavut community, Iqaluit Mayor Madeleine Redfern said floods took out the local bridge.

""People live in the Arctic. Our infrastructure is there. And we need to find the solutions, and the adaptations, and access those climate change dollars so that we stabilize our communities, because they're also continuing to grow,"" Redfern said.

""We need to look at, you know, moving beyond just using the Arctic as a photo backdrop.""

More greenhouses gases than expected

But it's not just the collapsing ground that scientists are worried about.

The study warns the rapid thawing of ice-rich permafrost could dramatically increase the amount of greenhouse gases released from ancient plants and animals frozen within the tundra — leading to further warming of the planet.

According to the findings, the melting permafrost could release 50 per cent more greenhouse gases than previously expected.

""Some of the earliest reports were that the carbon released could be enough to cause catastrophic climate change,"" Turetsky said.

Despite the rapid thaw, it'll be decades before the extra carbon release starts to influence global climate, she added.

Immediate solutions needed

Redfern acknowledged the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

But she said northern communities are feeling the impact of thawing permafrost right now, and she wants to see the federal government fund solutions.

In a statement to The Current, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada said it is investing $2 billion in a fund for infrastructure projects in rural and northern communities.

""An additional $400 million will help address energy security in remote and northern communities, including Indigenous communities,"" it said.

""Political rights are at the heart of our fundamental freedoms, yet they're being sacrificed now, because someone doesn't like a viewpoint or something,"" Garvey said.

""There's no laws broken.""

The National Citizens Alliance, which is based in Calgary, became a registered federal party in January, according to Elections Canada.

The Alliance is calling for a drastic reduction in immigrants to Canada, rescinding the Multiculturalism Act and opposes hate speech laws and anti-Islamophobia policies. The party also believes climate change is a hoax.

Kicked out of N.S. parade last year

Last year, the group was kicked out of an Annapolis Valley parade, and a Legion booking in Halifax was cancelled.

Two years ago, CBC News reported Garvey took part in an anti-immigration protest outside a school in Red Deer, Alta which included members of the group Worldwide Coalition Against Islam.

Garvey, then-leader of the National Advancement Party of Canada, a federally registered political party, said the intent of the protest was to raise awareness about the need to protect ""Canadian culture"" in schools.""

Garvey said the Legion is being intimidated by his political foes into shutting the party out of its halls, which he called censorship.

He said the party is looking into holding events at other venues.

Valerie Mitchell-Veinotte, executive director of the Legion's Nova Scotia-Nunavut command in Dartmouth, said the bookings were made in error.

No policy against NCA: Legion

She said the branches had to cancel because the halls turned out to be unavailable on the dates requested.

There is no policy against renting to the Alliance, Mitchell-Veinotte said.

Branches could make other dates available, but Mitchell-Veinotte said if they do, the command would like to be consulted ""just to ensure that they are making facilities available to organizations that share the same goals and objectives and values as the Royal Canadian Legion.""

https://www.thestar.com/news/cannabis/2019/05/02/half-a-million-canadians-used-weed-before-or-at-work-national-cannabis-survey.html,"Coincidentally, the population of the federal public service is only 273,500.",1.0,4.0,"CALGARY—Roughly 500,000 Canadians used cannabis before — or at — work since February, according to the latest National Cannabis Survey.

The survey’s latest instalment, released by Statistics Canada on Thursday, also found around 21.5 per cent of Albertans aged 15 and older — roughly 750,000 people — reported using cannabis in some form over the last three months. The national average is 18 per cent. Last May, it was closer to 14 per cent, marking what appears to be a slight bump in cannabis use following the legalization of recreational cannabis on Oct. 17.

The National Cannabis Survey has gauged Canadians’ cannabis use since February 2018, but Thursday’s release marked the first time it examined a full three months since legalization. Rebecca Haines-Saah, assistant professor at the University of Calgary’s Cumming School of Medicine, wasn’t surprised by the figures.

“From my familiarity with the data, there’s nothing very shocking about the prevalence changes that we’re seeing,” she said. “It’s what I would expect to see.”

Here are some highlights from the survey:

Roughly half a million Canadians reported using weed before or during work

Punching in after using weed — or simply lighting up on-the-clock — isn’t unusual. Around 514,000 Canadian workers, representing roughly 13 per cent of the country’s cannabis users, do so, according to the survey. Haines-Saah said this isn’t terribly shocking.

“I’m not surprised because many people don’t enjoy going to work, so they’re doing something to get them out of bed and get them out of the house, and go to work,” she said. “I’m not sanctioning that: I’m saying this is probably the reality of many people’s lives.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Workers have long used both legal and illegal substances on-the-clock, including prescription medication. Enjoying a drink at a team meeting with colleagues isn’t unusual — including, Haines-Saah said, in academia. Where it does become problematic is when a worker is using cannabis in a “safety-sensitive” job — such as a crane operator or a truck driver — where a lapse in co-ordination or judgment could lead to a catastrophic accident.

“Obviously, in safety-sensitive positions, we still need to have those strict guidelines and no-tolerance because we don’t want people impaired putting themselves at risk and other people at risk if they’re driving or operating heavy machinery,” Haines-Saah said.

Around 646,000 Canadians tried weed over the last three months — and half are aged 45 or older

This time last year, before Canada legalized recreational cannabis, roughly 327,000 Canadians said they tried weed for the first time. As of Jan. 1, this figure roughly doubled, although it doesn’t just include first-time tokers. The survey included former users who gave weed up, but returned to it after legalization.

Around half of these “new” users since February are in their mid-40s or older, compared to a third of users last year. Haines-Saah said this was expected: in recent years, older Canadians with chronic pain, sleep issues, or who’re undergoing cancer treatment are increasingly turning to cannabis.

“So, it makes sense that boomers are looking for this,” Haines-Saah said. “However, if they’re doing this through the recreational market, I would worry.”

She said medical supervision is important for anyone looking to use cannabis for a health condition.

Daily cannabis use hasn’t changed, but weekly and “occasional” use went up

About 6 per cent of all Canadians over the age of 15 — roughly 1.8 million people — said they use cannabis on a daily or near-daily basis since legalization. Daily weed users, according to the survey, are more likely to be men under the age of 25. Curiously, this rate of use is unchanged from the same time last year. The number of Canadians who use weekly went up 2 per cent, as did those who reported using once or twice in a three-month period.

After Colorado legalized recreational cannabis, Haines-Saah said daily users starting using more intensely — including cannabis with more tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant’s main psychoactive component — and more frequently. Canada’s data doesn’t appear to show a similar pattern, although she said public health is “watching and wrestling” with balancing the broad concerns around cannabis users versus the specific harms an at-risk group — such as daily users — may face.

Around a fifth of Canadians who drove after using weed also had booze in their system

Mixing alcohol and weed, and then getting behind the wheel, can impair a driver more than either substance on its own. According to the survey, around 3 per cent of cannabis users with a valid driver’s licence — roughly 123,000 people — admitted to driving after using both substances. It’s worth noting the rate of Canadians who reported driving within two hours after using weed remains unchanged from a year ago. Haines-Saah said public health guidelines suggest cannabis users wait between four and six hours before hitting the road.

But these figures may be lowballed

Haines-Saah believes the actual rate of Canadians who use cannabis is higher than the survey suggests. Legalization came into effect seven months ago, but she said the stigma around weed use lingers, which could translate into survey respondents lowballing their usage — or simply saying they’ve never tried it.

Researchers also need more data — and more time — to really understand how legalization is affecting Canadians.

“We need more of a five-year and a 10-year marker to make sense of what we’re seeing on the ground,” she said.

The whales usually make their first appearance in the region for the year in June, and there's an extra bit of good news for the endangered species: seven calves have been recorded so far south of the border in 2019.

""It's really nice to start seeing that we're getting more calves,"" said Garry Stenson, a DFO research scientist and head of its marine mammal division, on the calves being spotted off the coast of United States.

""It's gonna take a lot more before we're gonna be feeling at all comfortable, but it does help to have some. It's a much better view than what we had last year.""

No calves were born in 2018, and the overall population is estimated to be just 411 individuals, making it one of the most endangered whale species in the world.

The whale, which historically suffered from humans as the ""right"" whale to hunt, has been running into trouble again in recent years. Eighteen animals died in 2017, 12 of those in Canadian waters, thought to be the victims of ship collisions or fishing gear entanglements.

'It's too early to tell'

The deaths prompted the federal government to implement fishing restrictions in some areas — restrictions that have since been somewhat loosened — as well as regulations to slow down vessel traffic in shipping lanes.

Stenson said ""it's too early to tell"" if the restrictions have played a role in the lack of deaths in 2018.

""We really have to look at it over a number of years and see whether or not there's any change in mortality because of this,"" he said.

Adding to their vulnerability, the slow-moving species is also slow to reproduce. There are about 100 female North Atlantic right whales, said Stenson, and historically, those females could be counted on to give birth about every four years.

But by the 1990s that had stretched to six, and after research was updated in 2017, the interval between babies was pegged at about 10 years.

""We want to see that calving interval decline, back to six years, back to four years, so the females that are there start producing regularly,"" he told CBC Radio's On The Go, adding that besides ship collisions and getting tangled in nets, the mortality rate for the whales is low.

Research ramping up

As DFO ramps up its efforts to understand and get ahead of the right whale population problem, scientists admit they don't know that much about the species in the first place, and what they do know is rapidly changing.

The whales, easy to identify thanks to their distinctive white skin patches, usually spend part of spring, summer and fall in the Bay of Fundy and off southwest Nova Scotia.

But that pattern changed in 2015 when they began appearing in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with Stenson and other scientists suspecting the whales were adapting to changes in the zooplankton populations they feed on.

It's going to be a challenging few weeks that we'll have on the water. - Andrew Wright

To get a handle on where the whales are and what they're doing, the summer of 2019 will see a team of scientists from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec scour the area, with aerial surveys using planes and drones, as well as ship-based research.

""We're looking at the whole ecology, the whole ecosystem for these whales in our trip, hopefully in the next couple of months,"" said Andrew Wright, a DFO marine biologist who will be leading the summer's study in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, starting in mid-July.

Scientists will be monitoring sea conditions and nutrient levels to get a snapshot of how healthy the surrounding environment is, said Wright, as well as taking pictures of the whales to get a sense of how well-fed they are.

Undersea noise stress

They'll also be taking undersea recordings, and Wright also hopes to tag some whales with a suction cup-like tracker than will also take stock of what sounds the whales are hearing beneath the water.

""We do know that right whales are stressed by ship noise. It's more of a question of how stressful that is for them, and whether or not this is a long-term issue,"" said Wright.

Scientists are unsure whether the stress issue is a chronic one for the whales, or if it spikes during a close encounter with a ship. Wright's team hopes to answer that question by in a few ways.

One, by tagging the whales to record what they physically do when they encounter a ship. They also plan to employ drones and scoop up samples of blow — that misty mix expelled through the whale's blowholes — and measure the stress hormones within it.

""It's going to be a challenging few weeks that we'll have on the water,"" Wright said.

""We'll need the weather gods behind us, and just a little bit of luck on our side.""

The scientists plan to begin their studies in mid-July and continue to mid-August.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

Michael Chertoff has a warning for Canada about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Canada's federal government is currently deciding whether Huawei can be trusted to build the next generation of Internet infrastructure across the country.

Chertoff, who was the United States' homeland security secretary under former president George W. Bush, says that decision could have major consequences for Canada's relationships with both China and the United States.

Meanwhile, Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is due to appear in a Vancouver court where a judge will consider an extradition request from the United States.

Here is part of Chertoff's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.

Mr. Chertoff, how is the United States likely to respond if Justin Trudeau agrees to allow Huawei 5G network to be a principal part of our system?

I think it's going to raise concerns about the security of your system.

We've seen stories recently, in fact, involving more back doors or problems with Chinese software and hardware.

So that's going to create some obstacles to the ability to rapidly share data because they're concerned that there'll be a compromise.

Chertoff cautions Canadians to reconsider pursuing a 5G network deal with Chinese tech giant Huawei. (Reuters)

You know that China says that Huawei is a private company — that the Chinese government is not involved with it and that there are firewalls that would protect these networks from any kind of Chinese influence. What does the United States think of that?

I think most Americans are skeptical of that for a number of reasons.

First of all, the Chinese clearly anoint certain companies as champions and support them.

And if you just look at what happened recently, with respect to Canadians being arrested in China as retaliation for the arrest of a senior Huawei official, it suggests a degree of solicitude for the company by the Chinese government that is is not consistent with the idea that they're independent.

To could give the Chinese the ability to occupy a pivotal part of your infrastructure, one that will be, as I say, the commanding heights of the next 10 or 20 years of the economy, you're giving them enormous leverage in any dispute.

You're giving them a surface area for which they can potentially take intellectual property or otherwise compromise confidential material and you have to, I think, seriously view China as a rival, if not an adversary.

The U.S. is seeking the extradition of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, but Canada appears to be bearing the brunt of China's displeasure in a situation that blurs the lines between politics and justice. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

What could they potentially do?

Well, they could either find or embed pathways in to compromise networks and allow the theft of intellectual property.

They could introduce disruption or latency into the network because it's not just the hardware and software that you first install. It's all of the updates, the patches, everything you do to them to tend to and monitor the system going forward.

It's not just a question of taking data and either misusing it or stealing intellectual property. This will actually be part of the mechanism that controls your industrial control systems and your operating systems.

So the person who dominates that, in a way, has the ability to affect everything from your power grid to your air traffic control system to your even your sensitive national security infrastructure.

The Canadian government is deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention of two Canadians in China. Read my statement: <a href=""https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc"">https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc</a> —@cafreeland

As you mentioned, we have two Canadians who are detained in China, held in isolation. Two others on death row. In other matters, our trade is being deeply effected as the Chinese shut us out of the markets. All this because of this extradition request from your country for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meanwhile, your president is busy securing a comprehensive free trade agreement with China and moving ahead and benefiting. So do you understand why Canadians might feel like we're being played here?

Well, I don't think that's a fair inference. Look, I think there are a couple of different things.

First of all, I mean obviously the security relationship the U.S. and Canada have is a very strong one. We're allies and I don't think anybody believes the U.S. is an ally of China — nor is it clear to me what's going to come out of this trade agreement.

I think what actually is demonstrated by Chinese behaviour is that when you're touching on what they view as one of their national champions, they will use any leverage they have to punish you.

And that ought to cause people to ask the question: well geez, if we give them the keys to the kingdom on our 5G network, what will they do if they don't like something we do in the future?

But wait a second. We arrested Meng Wanzhou at your behest, at your government's behest, and we're being punished while you move ahead with getting the trade deals that we're shut out of now. So I guess the question is, you know, at some point this seems rather unfair to us.

First of all, I don't know whether the Chinese aren't going to try to punish the U.S.

But if you're asking me why the Chinese decided they were going to focus on Canada in retaliating, I think it suggests they're trying to bully Canada and it may be that they feel they can get away with it more with Canada or that they can intervene before the extradition gets done.

Well, maybe the United States should start pushing back at our behest a bit.

I think we may see some further developments. I would not describe your relationship between China and the U.S. as a warm and fuzzy relationship.

There are a lot of different deals going on but I would be very careful not to have the Chinese try to drive a wedge between the Canadians and the Americans, by making it seem as if they're picking on one and not on the other.

Well, President Trump has said that he may trade Meng Wanzhou for getting his trade deals. So, maybe we're being played by your country as well.

I don't know what you're referring to and I don't read Twitter as a map for what's going to happen.

I would not presume anybody knows what's going to be the next step in all this because there are a lot of balls in the air.

Is it not true that President Trump suggested that he could exchange Meng Wanzhou for a trade deal with China?

He often says all kinds of different things, which never come to pass. So I'm not going to speculate as to what was in his head. But I'm not going to presume that this has any realistic prospect of happening.

Is a Lee Einfield a hunting rifle?",3.0,34.0,"Police are scrambling to keep pace with criminals who are coming up with creative ways to supply Canada's black market with firearms.

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

READ: Canadians want something done about gun violence — they just can't agree what

WATCH:

Guns are killing Canadians at a rate not seen in a decade, and gun control can only address part of the problem. Police suggest about half of the guns used to commit crimes are smuggled from outside the country. Most of those are believed to be coming from our southern neighbours through an illegal pipeline. 12:22

Amid a rising gun homicide rate and a growing debate over what to do about it, The National's special series on gun violence takes a closer look at gun control laws. Some say they persecute, others say they protect, but in recent years the trend has been toward looser laws. 12:12"
https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/05/16/trudeau-takes-aim-at-big-tech-announces-digital-charter.html,No argument there.,4.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

Social media giants ignore law, don’t take Canada seriously, say MPs

Star Editorial | Christchurch Call is a good step in fighting extremism

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,You've got that backwards.,-2.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

New designs are way more efficient, safe, and just better than old reactor designs. Nuclear fuel can be stored safe for millions of years in underground repositories.",5.0,44.0,"Canada has been at the forefront of nuclear energy for almost 80 years. Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

Used fuel from the Bruce Power plant is stored in the form of pellets that fit into tubes. These tubes are collected into bundles and packed into carbon steel tubes coated in copper. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

A deep geological repository is a massive and expensive proposal and will take decades to build and safely secure Canada’s nuclear waste. There is clearly momentum towards constructing a repository. If so, it seems like one more question may arise in the years ahead: does it really makes sense to build two?"
https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/flood-plains-1.5135336,"First thing from Neil in months that is not a blatant Trudeau suckup.  And likely the last until October, 2019.",-11.0,109.0,"Note to outraged conservative readers: this opinion column was not assigned by Katie Telford. (The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

Five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

More on that next week."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/austrian-immigrants-cape-bretoon-1.5123091?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar,Ouff.,3.0,14.0,"A family from Austria has been ordered out of Canada, and must leave this week, after running afoul of immigration rules.

They hope to be back, but it'll be at least a year before they can return to Cape Breton, where they've sunk their life savings into a home and farm.

Reinhard and Romana Fugger have invested nearly $500,000 after buying and improving a rural property in Grand River, Richmond County, in 2015.

They say a local man, Frank Eckhardt and his company F.E. Property Sales, facilitated the property purchase and promised easy immigration to Canada.

The Fuggers say that help with the immigration process never came.

""We find this property and we think we can do this in an easy way, because we have the information before that it is not hard, maybe easy, to immigrate here,"" said Reinhard Fugger.

Eckhardt's company website, hosted in Germany and aimed at Europeans, advertises property sales and ""new settler consultation.""

The Fuggers say they found out after they got here that they paid more than the property was worth.

They paid $160,000 for 4.5 hectares of land with a small summer cottage to a lawyer recommended by Eckhardt who handled the real estate transaction. The property value was assessed at $82,000 at the time.

Real estate records show that most properties in the area sell for 1.5 times the assessed value, but the Fuggers paid 1.95 times the value.

The couple say they assumed that was because Eckhardt and the lawyer were going to help them with immigration.

Meanwhile, the Fuggers spent most of the first year digging a well, adding a stove and chimney, clearing the land and planting a garden.

Reinhard Fugger said the couple was so busy making their new place livable that their six-month visitor visas expired before they could apply for permanent residency.

Family served with removal order

When they turned to Eckhardt and the lawyer for help, they were referred to an immigration specialist in Halifax.

The Fuggers kept working on their property, bought another in nearby L'Ardoise, and had a second son, who is a Canadian citizen.

At the same time, they continued to try to apply for permanent residency on their own.

The Fuggers say they spent all their money on their property and couldn't afford an immigration lawyer or consultant.

Canada Border Services Agency eventually investigated and the Fuggers have now been served with a removal order.

They must leave by Wednesday, or face deportation and the possibility of not being able to return.

The Fuggers said they were naive and foolish to believe immigration would be easy, but Reinhard said they know they have to follow the rules and are resigned to leaving.

""In this time, we have to go back,"" he said. ""It is the only way. It is not allowed to do the paperwork inside Canada.""

Frank Eckhardt is a German immigrant who's lived in Cape Breton for 19 years.

He calls himself a property developer and runs his company out of an office in St. Peter's.

The Fuggers have emails and documents they say they got from Eckhardt implying that he was acting on their behalf in the land purchase, and they say he told them over the phone that immigration would be easy once they got here.

In an interview at his office, Eckhardt would not consent to being recorded.

But he said he is neither a realtor nor a registered immigration consultant, despite his website offering property sales along with ""new settler consultation.""

Eckhardt said he only sells land he owns or maintains an interest, and is simply willing to tell people about his immigration experience if they ask.

He said settler consultations consist of offering suggestions about local services, such as who sells insurance in Cape Breton, or who drills wells or builds homes.

""If someone asks me, 'OK, the nice home over there, do you know the owner?' I can give them the phone number,"" Eckhardt said.

He said he got no money for helping the Fuggers buy their property.

The Fuggers said they have an email in which Eckhardt admits he expects a commission from the property seller.

But Eckhardt said he doesn't know anything about that.

Eckhardt said he offered considerable help to the Fuggers when they first arrived in Canada, including putting them up in his guest cottage for weeks, for just the cost of the power, and allowing them to store a shipping container on his property for as long as needed.

Eckhardt said Richmond County, like all of Cape Breton, needs immigrants, and he is attracting them from Europe and helping maintain and create jobs in the area.

However, he said, people need to take personal responsibility for the rules and the process.

Immigration lawyer Lee Cohen says the Fuggers are in a bad situation, as owning property doesn't open any doors to immigration. (CBC)

Halifax immigration lawyer Lee Cohen said owning property doesn't open any doors to immigration, despite that widespread belief.

The Fuggers are in a terrible situation, he said.

Depending on the type of removal order, the Fuggers may have difficulty getting back into Canada, Cohen said.

Second son born in Cape Breton

Fugger gets emotional talking about his youngest son, who was born in the house overlooking Grand River.

""He's a citizen and he have the passport and all the things,"" Fugger said. ""Yeah, that's also a hard point for me.""

Despite their immigration troubles, the Fuggers have fallen in love with Cape Breton and hope to return.

""We want to stay here and we want to come back,"" said Fugger.

""Yeah, it's really great, because there are a lot of potential here to start up business, and ... the thing is we own a second property in L'Ardoise and we want to start up a business in this building.""

Michele MacPhee lives in the area and knows the Fuggers through their children's playgroup.

She said the Fuggers are hard workers with progressive ideas about food security and connecting children with nature.

""They're really good people,"" MacPhee said.

""They have done a lot to create a life for themselves here. I'm not familiar with the details of the process and the order ... (but) I'm comfortable with them staying.""

MacPhee said Cape Breton needs immigrants, especially ones like the Fuggers.

""They have a lot of skills and a lot of knowledge to share and I think that that certainly would be an additional asset for our community.""

Trust the government to fuck up selling weed.,48.0,45.0,"Canadians' interest in cannabis-infused food is waning even as edibles are expected to become legal by mid-October, according to a new study that looks at changing attitudes toward marijuana.

The study out of Dalhousie University also found that 60 per cent of cannabis users continue to buy from the same supplier as they did before smoking pot became legal last year.

""The reason why they did that is for convenience, quality and most importantly price,"" lead author Sylvain Charlebois told CBC's Maritime Noon on Thursday.

""The price of cannabis in the black market is actually much lower, much more affordable than the legal cannabis.""

The study found that 20 per cent of Canadians say they're worried about being seen buying cannabis. (Brett Ruskin/CBC)

Charlebois said he believes when edibles become legal, it could actually continue to fuel the black market.

""The regulatory framework presented by Health Canada is so restrictive that it won't entice manufacturers in Canada to produce edibles,"" he said.

""If there is appetite to consume edibles — no pun — people will actually look for that product. And we may actually see more products being imported into Canada illegally to support that demand.""

Drop in legalization support

The study surveyed 1,051 Canadians over four days last month. The estimated margin of error is 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20. The aim was to compare attitudes before and after October 2018 legalization.

It found the number of Canadians in support of legalization in general fell by 19 per cent — and uncertainty about legalization rose by seven per cent. Only about six per cent of people reported starting using since legalization.

Of the 68 per cent of Canadians who were in favour of legalizing cannabis in 2017, 93 per cent of that group were willing to try an edible product. That dropped to 70 per cent in April.

""That's a significant drop,"" Charlebois said, adding it's probably for a number of different reasons — including media reports of specific incidents, such as when a four-year-old girl in Nova Scotia was hospitalized after accidentally ingesting cannabis-infused chocolate.

The study also found that Canadians are worried about edibles posing a greater risk to children (64 per cent) and pets (54 per cent).

Of those surveyed, 20 per cent said while they don't use cannabis now, they might consider edibles once they become legal. (Shutterstock / Pong Pong)

Charlebois said he believes Health Canada has been focusing on mitigating the risk of cannabis products and not actually educating people.

""We figured out that Canadians are mostly cannabinoid illiterate,"" he said.

People are also concerned about privacy: almost half said they're uncertain about their co-workers knowing they use cannabis recreationally.

The study also found edibles carry less stigma than other forms of cannabis, and 20 per cent of respondents said while they don't use cannabis now, they might consider edibles once they become legal.

Charlebois said in Colorado, where marijuana is also legal, 50 per cent of all sales are edibles.

""The edible market in particular really has got a lot of people to consume cannabis, when really they didn't when only the dry stuff was legal. So we are expecting that to happen in Canada as well,"" he said.

While stigma wasn't something addressed in the 2017 study, Charlebois said the most recent findings suggest more than half of people believe retail facilities should be kept out of residential neighbourhoods. Less than 20 per cent said they're worried about being seen buying cannabis.

""The stigma was not as high or as strong as we thought it would be. However we have a long way to go from seeing cannabis become socially normalized in Canada,"" Charlebois said.

""And with restrictions, and in particular restrictions affecting edibles, that process may take much longer than expected."""

Doesn't the EU have a model that has been proven to work well, would it be that hard to simply analyze how their system works and then adopt it?",27.0,104.0,"The federal government is rolling out its air passenger protection regulations on the eve of the summer travel season setting out what compensation airlines must pay for failing to provide adequate services to passengers.

The new regulations announced Friday will be launched in two phases. Some regulations come into force on July 15, while others will not take effect until December 15.

""Our goal was to provide a world-leading approach to air passenger rights that would be predictable and fair for passengers while ensuring our air carriers remain strong and competitive,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement.

""After a long and thorough consultation process, I am proud to say these new regulations achieve that balance and will give air travellers the rights and treatment they pay for and deserve,"" he added.

The regulations will apply to all flights to, from and within Canada, including connecting flights. Large airlines, those that have serviced two million passengers or more in the last two years, will have a slightly different regulatory regime than smaller airlines in some cases.

Smaller airlines, for example, will have to pay less compensation for delays or cancellations that are within the airline's control but are not related to safety issues.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau announces new regulations and penalties for airlines related to air travel delays. 1:50

Broadly, flight disruptions — tarmac delays, flight cancellations, and denials of boarding — that are within an airline's control require compensation be paid, standards of treatment be upheld and the passenger's itinerary be completed.

Flight disruptions within an airline's control but required for safety reasons will not require compensation but airlines will have to maintain a standard of treatment and complete a passenger's itinerary.

Situations outside an airline's control that cause a flight disruption will only require the airline to ensure the passenger's itinerary is completed.

Situations within an airline's control include overbooking and scheduled maintenance.

Delays within an airline's control due to safety include mechanical problems and safety calls made by the pilot.

Disruptions outside an airline's control include a wide range of possibilities such as political instability, weather, natural disasters and security threats.

Rules in place by July 15

The first set of rules lays out the regulations and compensation regime related to delays on the tarmac, what happens when a passenger is denied boarding, lost and damaged luggage and the transportation of musical instruments.

The standards of treatment during a delay on the tarmac that must be in force by July 15 include ensuring that all passengers have access to working toilets.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau speaks during a news conference in Ottawa last month. Garneau said new rules announced Friday for airlines came after extensive consultation with passengers and the industry. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

An airline will also have to ensure the aircraft is properly ventilated and kept either cool or warm depending on the time of year. Passengers will also have to be provided food and drink and the ability to communicate with people outside of the plane free of charge, if possible.

Planes that have been on the tarmac for three hours will be required to return to the gate so people can get off. The only exception is when a departure is likely within the first 45 minutes after the three-hour time. In that case, the plane can remain where it is.

Overbooking

Starting July 15, passengers who are prevented from boarding an aircraft because of overbooking will be compensated financially depending on the length of time they are delayed from reaching their final destination.

Overbooking delays of less than six hours will require a minimum $900 payment, delays between six and nine hours mean a minimum $1,800 payment and delays longer than nine hours will see passengers compensated a minimum of $2,400.

When it comes to lost or damaged baggage, an airline will be liable for $2,100 for the lost bag and will also have to refund any baggage fees paid for the lost bag.

Airlines are also going to have to include terms and conditions for the transportation of musical instruments whether they are taken as a carry on or are checked into the cargo hold.

Phase two

The rules and compensation for cancelled flights and delays are part of phase two of the rollout.

As of December 15, airlines will have to provide compensation to passengers for delayed or cancelled flights depending on the size of the airline.

Delayed arrival at a final destination of between three to six hours will cost large airlines $400 and small airlines $125. Delays of between six to nine hour will cost large airlines $700 and small airlines $250. Delays greater than nine hours will cost large airlines $1,000 and smaller airlines half that amount.

The regulations do not only require an airline ensure the passenger gets to their final destination, but that they do so in the same class of service.

If an airline cannot rebook a passenger on their own airline and the delay is longer than nine hours, the airline has to book the passenger on a competing airline. If the passenger decides the delay has rendered the trip useless they will get a refund and the required financial compensation.

By mid December, airlines will also have to ensure that children under the age of five are seated next to their parent or guardian, children aged five to 11 are in the same row and no more than one seat away from their parent or guardian and children aged 12 or 13 are no more than one row away.

Airlines that don't adhere to the new standards can be fined up to $25,000 per incident by the Canadian Transport Agency.

""Thousands of Canadians participated in the consultations that helped shape these new rules,"" Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency, said in a statement.

She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

Manufacturers are also taking steps to purposely rig their products so that they cannot be repaired.",18.0,902.0,"A Canadian non-profit that advocates for an open and affordable internet wants Ottawa to make electronic devices like smartphones easier to fix.

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-defence-committee-1.5138975,"&gt;Lol no. It said that rampant obstruction of justice prevented them from finding collusion.

No, that's absolutely not what it said.

Read pages 1 and 2 of the Mueller report.",-5.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

The Mounties released a statement last week defending their handling of the case and — as late as Monday — had turned aside further requests for comment."
https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/05/22/ford-government-slashes-funding-to-childrens-aid-societies.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/04/30/governments-are-nothing-like-households/#5010fb6754f8,5.0,43.0,"The Ford government is reducing funding for children and youth at risk by $84.5 million, according to an analysis of provincial spending estimates by the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies.

The reduction includes a $28 million cut to the $1.5 billion the province gives 49 children’s aid societies in Ontario, increasing concerns about the ability of agencies to serve and protect vulnerable children. The cut comes as 18 child protection agencies struggle with deficits totalling more than $12 million.

The deficits have already forced some agencies to lay off staff and reduce the number of children at risk they take into care.

“A decrease in children in care does not mean there are fewer children in need of protection,” the OACAS warned in a PowerPoint produced in late March, outlining its core messages before the provincial budget was tabled.

The association’s post-budget analysis suggests their warning may not have been heard.

The $84.5 million cut for youth at risk is contained in a May 16 “briefing note” the OACAS sent to top CAS officials, and obtained by the Star. The calculations are based on the government’s operating and capital spending estimates tabled in the legislature May 9.

The OACAS calculated funding envelopes that fall under the budget line of “child and youth at risk,” including services for child protection and youth involved with the justice system.

The association is uncertain about the full impact of the cuts. Some funding envelopes have been eliminated and new ones created. It’s unclear if programs funded under the eliminated envelopes will continue to be funded under the new ones. Some of the cuts may involve the closing of unused facilities or resources, particularly in the area of youth justice. But when all the pluses and minuses are calculated, the funding shortfall is $84.5 million, according to the OACAS.

“We are concerned about the impact of any potential cuts to our members and to the families that they serve,” Nicole Bonnie, chief executive officer of the OACAS said in an email response to questions.

“At this time we do not have details as to which programs will be funded or who will deliver them,” Bonnie added. “We are waiting for more detailed information from the ministry to understand the exact nature of the impact on child welfare.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Bonnie hopes to soon meet with Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. “Our message is and always has been that the children and families we serve are the most marginalized and disenfranchised, and programs that support their well-being need to be fully funded.”

The minister’s office did not respond to direct questions about the cuts. In an emailed statement, MacLeod’s press secretary, Derek Rowland, described the well-being of vulnerable young people as the government’s “utmost priority.” The steady decline of children being taken into care since 2006, he added, has helped most children’s aid societies balance their budgets and the ministry is working with those that haven’t.

“We will be holding Ontario’s Children’s Aid Societies and other providers to higher standards to keep our kids safe,” Rowland said, denouncing what he described as “the lack of oversight and relaxed regulation” of the previous Liberal government.

Rowland said the government is increasing investments in prevention programs “to ensure kids keep out of trouble.” The government also “expects significant savings” in the youth justice sector after a review found “underutilized detention facilities.”

A plan to reduce the number of children’s aid societies through amalgamation is also being considered by the ministry.

What isn’t in doubt is that children’s aid societies will have less core funding to work with.

One children’s aid society, Brant Family and Children’s Services, has struggled with deficits that forced the layoff of 26 workers in March, in a community facing perhaps the worst opioid addiction epidemic in the province. Its executive director then posted a letter to the Brantford area community on the agency’s website, warning of serious consequences.

“When governments cut child welfare services (managers, front-line staff, and support services), children ultimately die or are allowed by society to live in unbearable, violent and neglectful conditions,” Andy Koster wrote.

“With higher caseloads and tight timelines, workers are forced to move from one crisis to another instead of planning and working proactively with families to prevent future incidents,” he added. “Despite best efforts, children fall through the cracks and suffer the consequences of insufficient resources.”

The cuts for children at risk also comes on the heels of the government eliminating the office that advocated for children and youth.

Kiaras Gharabaghi, director of Ryerson University’s School of Child and Youth Care, denounced the cuts as implemented without consultations.

“They are cuts that have no interest in making the system work better for kids and families,” he said in an interview after reviewing the OACAS document.

“This sector requires a different approach,” Gharabaghi added. “It’s one where young people die by violence, by suicide, by neglect. It’s not the same as increasing class sizes in schools to save some money.”

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

The recipes are among dozens that have been developed by 26 people, including food-service managers, chefs and dietitians who were offered two-year fellowships at hospitals from British Columbia to Newfoundland and Labrador as part of a campaign called Nourish Health.

Its goal is to help create institutional policies through nourishing meals made from locally bought ingredients for patients who may have been accustomed to powdered mashed potatoes as a mainstay of ""hospital food.""

Nourish Health spokeswoman Hayley Lapalme said the initiative, predominately funded by the McConnell Foundation, also aims to elevate the role of food as an important part of healing, though food services are categorized with other expenditures such as laundry and parking.

On the west coast, hospital staff prepare meals from traditional ingredients such as wild salmon as a connection to local culture. (Justin McElroy/CBC)

Two hospitals in Haida Gwaii, B.C., on the province's west coast, have been part of the program that has allowed staff to use traditional ingredients such as wild salmon, cod and halibut in the region where half the population is Indigenous.

Shelly Crack, a dietitian for Northern Health, said much of the food served at the facilities was brought in from other provinces and countries, adding to transportation and environmental costs when fish, berries and vegetables were available locally.

""A lot of our elders like the salmon served lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, with sauces served on the side,"" said Crack, adding traditional foods have helped people connect to positive experiences from their early years, and that has promoted healing.

""It almost brings them right back to the land and memories of family and harvesting food. It's that connection to culture and family, this feeling of well-being.""

Raising patient satisfaction, lowering food waste

Health-care policy leaders, doctors and those involved in the national fellowship will be attending the Food for Health Symposium in Toronto on Wednesday and Thursday to showcase sustainable recipes that could be included on hospital menus in 2030, decades after governments across the country contracted out food services at most facilities as a cost-saving measure.

Alex Munter, CEO of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, said the Ottawa facility became the first in Canada to introduce room service 15 years ago.

He said offerings like dim sum, butter chicken and tacos drove up patients' satisfaction with food from 30 per cent to 98 per cent while lowering expenses because food was being eaten, not tossed in the garbage.

""We're about healing and nourishing and not about feeding,"" Munter said of the room-service model most common in the United States.

""Since 2015, we've been providing local and sustainable menus for patients and families,"" he said. ""If your child is here you can order off the menu as well as in the cafeteria.""

Munter said the hospital's chef, Simon Wiseman, is among the 26 ""innovators"" in the Nourish initiative and last week created a tofu dish as a potential contender in a competition at the symposium.

The focus was zero waste, and even the plate was made of wheat, Munter said.

Nutritionally adequate but falling short

Toronto chef Joshna Maharaj said she helped create a healthy menu at the Scarborough Hospital in Ontario as part of a one-year pilot project in 2011, when she cooked food on site with staff whose cooking skills had gone to waste after years of reheating trucked-in frozen meals.

However, she said the program was not continued due to unrelated policy changes.

Maharaj said food served at most hospitals may be deemed nutritiously adequate, but it falls far short of what is healthy for sick people, as she recently learned after a day surgery that required a tube to be put down her throat.

She said a slushie or a sorbet would have been ideal but she decided ice cubes and ginger ale would suffice after ""a most pitiful egg salad sandwich with dry corners"" got stuck to the roof of her mouth.

""The deep insult of it was what hit me,"" Maharaj said, adding she's decided to spend her career advocating for healthy hospital food.

""Once we deal with the food on the plate there's a much broader opportunity for institutions to support health and wellness and make wonderful financial impacts in the local economy and the agriculture economy. We have a sad, sad lack of vision about this in the country, which is why I'm attempting to scream and yell so loudly."""
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-philpott-federal-election-1.5149284,Hi Justin.,7.0,41.0,"Former Liberal cabinet members Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott say they will make announcements Monday about their political futures.

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."

Now, he's the one lending a helping hand, as hundreds of evacuees forced from their homes by a wildfire near High Level, Alta., stream into town, looking for a place to stay.

High Level is about 500 kilometres north of Slave Lake, which in turn is about 250 kilometres north of Edmonton.

Schmidt, who's the director of finance for the town of Slave Lake, said 1,065 people have registered at the town's temporary emergency operating centre.

The town is ensuring evacuees have the food, shelter and access to medical services they need, he said.

The Chuckegg Creek fire near High Level is the largest active wildfire in Alberta.

""Having that little bit of understanding for what they are going through is helping us to provide for their needs, to provide a helping hand, or a helping word to get them through,"" Schmidt told CBC Edmonton AM host Mark Connolly.

The 1,065 people who have registered in Slave Lake are only a fraction of the nearly 5,000 residents from High Level and parts of nearby Mackenzie County who have been forced from their homes due to the Chuckegg Creek wildfire. People fleeing the fire have also been told to report to evacuation centres in Peace River, High Prairie, Grande Prairie, Fort Vermilion and Hay River.

Shift in weather predicted over weekend

As of Thursday morning, the direction of the wind was blowing the fire away from town, said High Level Mayor Crystal McAteer, who also warned that things can change quickly.

""We are anticipating a change in weather patterns, so we are doing a lot of proactive, pre-burning on the fuel that hasn't been burned around the town,"" she told CBC News Network on Thursday.

Crews began controlled burns between the town and the fire along the highways leading south and west from the town in order to remove fuel.

The winds are predicted to shift on Saturday and Sunday, the mayor said. There is no rain in the immediate forecast.

To prepare for any shift in winds, the town is using sprinklers on properties, and firefighters have set up fire barriers around the town.

A special air quality statement has been issued for the region, with smoke from the fire causing poor air quality and reduced visibility.

Sprinklers are being used in High Level, Alta., as a precautionary measure. (Raffy Boudjikanian/CBC News)

As of 4 p.m. Thursday, the fire was about three kilometres south of High Level.

""This out-of-control wildfire is almost 92,000 hectares,"" the update said.

A mandatory evacuation order remains in place for the town of High Level and parts of Mackenzie County, which is south of High Level.

McAteer said she can't say when people will be able to return to their homes.

""We don't have a timeline,"" she said. ""There are a lot of factors. The threat is still imminent, even though you don't see the big, huge plumes of smoke and the fire. It does move through the swamp areas and the marshland. The big test will be when we have that wind shift.""

Slave Lake residents remember 2011 fire

The uncertain timeline means Schmidt, and the residents of Slave Lake, will have plenty to do to help residents of High Level in the days to come.

Schmidt said helping others now brings back memories of his own experience in Slave Lake in 2011, when a wildfire forced the town's 7,000 residents to flee. In that fire, about one-third of the properties in town were destroyed or damaged.

He described that 2011 experience as ""surreal"" and dream-like.

""We saw the wall of fire closing in,"" Schmidt recalled. ""We were told to get in our vehicle and get going. I quickly ran home and got my wife and my kids. My wife picked up our four cats in one scoop and threw them in a bankers box. We jumped in our vehicle and got out of town.""

He said residents of Slave Lake are eager to do everything they can to help people displaced by this fire, after so many people helped them back in 2011.

""We, as a community, want to pay that forward and provide all the help and the support that we can."""
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-senate-resolution-charter-1.5128399,"Those new tariffs on China will bring Canada more than that.

https://imgur.com/gallery/BHeV6rF",13.0,73.0,"The United States Senate has passed a resolution praising the Canadian government for the way it has conducted itself in the case of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

The resolution commends ""the government of Canada for upholding the rule of law and expressing concern over actions by the government of the People's Republic of China in response to a request from the United States government to the government of Canada for the extradition of a Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. executive.""

The resolution is nonbinding and is considered an expression of the Senate's will on the issue.

Canada has face widespread political and economic pressure from China since Meng's arrest in December and has been looking to its international allies for diplomatic assistance.

In February, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland met with U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, to ask for American help in its ongoing tussle with China over Meng's arrest. Risch ultimately introduced the Senate resolution.

Since Meng's arrest, China has placed a number of trade hurdles in front of Canadian exporters — banning imports from two canola producers, tying up shipments over paperwork and putting unusual obstacles in the way of Canadian soybean and pea exporters.

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December after Canadian officials detained Meng in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S. She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.

In March, China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him by Spavor.

'Arbitrary detention'

In December, a few months before that accusation was made, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Kovrig and Spavor were being unlawfully detained and should be returned to Canada.

That position was affirmed by the Senate Tuesday in a resolution that expressed concern over China's ""apparent arbitrary detention and abusive treatment of Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in apparent retaliation for the government of Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou.""

One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial in January. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling. Last month, a Chinese court sentenced another Canadian, Fan Wei, to death for participating in a global methamphetamine operation.

Meng's Charter of Rights defence

The resolution landed as Meng's defence team said it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the U.S. because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest at Vancouver's airport was unlawful.

Benjamin Howes, a spokesman for Huawei Canada, told reporters in Vancouver Wednesday that Meng's legal team will also argue that her rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated during her arrest.

""Ms. Meng intends to apply to the court for a stay of the extradition proceedings. Canadians value the rule of law and the Charter of Rights,"" he said.

""We have trust in the Canadian legal process and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored.""

According to the federal government's guide to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ""any person in Canada – whether they are a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident or a newcomer – has the rights and freedoms contained in the Charter.""

Seeking more documents

During a hearing Wednesday, Crown prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley, who is representing the Attorney General of Canada, asked Justice Heather Holmes to see that Meng's case proceeds as quickly as possible, proposing a first court date by the end of August.

He said the allegations against Meng centre on a misrepresentation she is alleged to have made to a bank that put the institution's economic interests at risk, adding it's not yet time to make arguments in the case.

The defence said it needs more time to gather documents through freedom of information requests. It also wants audio from Meng's questioning at the time of her arrest, which already has been described as unlawful in a civil suit."

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

But it is because people are fucking stupid.",19.0,109.0,"Note to outraged conservative readers: this opinion column was not assigned by Katie Telford. (The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

More on that next week."
https://globalnews.ca/news/5253353/cancer-patient-disability-insurance-canada/,"Ummm....you do realize that insurance companies manage plans that employers own and have designed? In vast majority of cases the pot of money to pay out claims (including disability) is owned by the plan sponsor, not the insurance company, and the plan sponsor decides how it will be administered for which it pays the fee to the insurer. Only the smallest of employers do fully insured plans (I.e. pay the insurer to take the risk and use insurer’s money for it).",1.0,91.0,"Phillip Fitzsimmons woke up in the middle of the night one day in February 2016 with a breathtaking, shooting pain in his abdomen.

“It felt like somebody was taking a sword and jamming it between my legs and on the right side of my stomach,” the 36-year old Brampton, Ont., man told Global News over the phone.

By March, Fitzsimmons had been forced to leave his job as an assembly-plant quality monitor, which requires heavy lifting. By May, medical tests had confirmed a diagnosis of intestinal cancer. And by July 2016, his workplace disability benefits had kicked in, providing a monthly income that Fitzsimmons said was just under $2,000.

But in March 2018 Fitzsimmons was informed his benefits would be terminated as of July of that year, even while he was still undergoing daily chemotherapy treatment.

In correspondence reviewed by Global News, Manulife, the group disability insurance provider at Fitzsimmons’ workplace, said he no longer qualified for the benefit because his illness did not prevent him from performing less physically strenuous jobs, like data-entry clerk or information services representative, that he might be able to get with his professional and educational background.

READ MORE: Want to cut your risk of cancer? Try changing these behaviours

The termination of benefits left Fitzsimmons with only around $1,000 in monthly income from his Canada Pension Plan disability benefit, a situation he described as being under financial “house arrest.”

“I can’t go anywhere. I literally have to plan every move that I make because that’s how impoverished I’m living right now,” he told Global News.

Manulife rejected two appeals by Fitzsimmons in which he provided additional evidence to sustain his claim that severe side effects from the chemo treatments rendered him unable to work. The documents included a letter from his oncologist at Toronto’s Mt. Sinai Hospital, which described “severe” symptoms including nausea; dizziness; fatigue; sharp, shooting abdominal pains; loose and irritable bowels and headaches, among others.

Due to those side effects, Fitzsimmons was “unable to (perform) any kind labour of any kind,” the letter reads (emphasis in the original document).

In a document citing that letter, Manulife wrote that its own medical consultant had advised that Fitzsimmons may be able to achieve some degree of symptom relief with drugs like Gravol, Imodium or Nabilone.

But doctors never told him to take such over-the-counter medications, Fitzsimmons’ lawyer, Nainesh Kotak, told Global News.

In March, shortly after receiving his second appeal denial, Fitzsimmons hired Kotak and filed a lawsuit against Manulife with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

On May 9, one day after Global News contacted the company about the case, Manulife said it would reinstate his disability benefits dating back to March 2018, according to Kotak.

“We are very empathetic to Mr. Fitzsimmons’ situation and are sorry for what he has experienced,” Manulife said in an emailed statement to Global News.

“We strive to do everything within our power to satisfy our customers and were already in the process of reviewing and responding to this complex matter. We have been in contact with Mr. Fitzsimmons’ lawyer to work on this together,” the company also said.

Group disability benefits and the critical two-year mark

Fitzsimmons’ story highlights a common issue with workplace disability benefits, Kotak said, speaking before Manulife announced the resumption of benefits.

Story continues below advertisement

Often, eligibility for group disability benefits is subject to two tests. The first, which is administered when the worker first claims disability, is aimed at verifying whether she or he has become unable to perform her or his regular job, something known as “regular-occupation test” or “own-occupation test.”

READ MORE: The CRA makes it so hard to get the disability tax credit, many don’t even try

But after a period of time, usually two to five years, the criteria for eligibility become more stringent. Workers are only allowed to maintain their benefits if they are deemed unable to perform any job for which they may be qualified given their skills and experience, something called “any-occupation test.”

The second test is the one Fitzsimmons failed, despite the fact that he’d been approved for CPP disability, which the government defines as a benefit available to contributors who “are disabled and cannot work at any job on a regular basis.”

In correspondence with Fitzsimmons, Manulife said eligibility for his group disability benefits beyond the two-year mark was restricted to those unable to perform “any occupation for which the employee is qualified or may be reasonably become qualified by training, education or experience.”

The insurer acknowledged that Fitzsimmons had started to receive CPP disability benefits but told him that “CPP requirements for eligibility differ from the contractual provisions of your group policy.”

While Fitzsimmons’ case “raises eyebrows,” the any-occupation test is a common reason why workers lose their employer disability benefits, Kotak said.

How private disability coverage can supplement group benefits

The need to supplement work disability benefits with private insurance is becoming an increasingly important issue, not just due to the dreaded two-year mark but also because employers, under pressure to cut costs, are becoming less and less generous with their group disabilities policies, according to personal finance expert Preet Banerjee.

A couple of decades ago, Banerjee said, it was standard for companies to offer disability coverage until age 65. Today, he added, it’s more common to see the maximum length of this benefit limited to much shorter periods, like 10 or five years.

Employees, Banerjee said, aren’t always aware of this.

“They’ll just say: ‘Oh, do they offer disability coverage or not?’ And they don’t really take a look at what is the nature of that coverage,” he told Global News.

Individual policies can be pricey, but they’re usually well worth the money, Banerjee argues. People, he noted, are much more likely to become at least temporarily disabled during their working lives than they are of dying prematurely.

According to Statistics Canada, working-age Canadians have a one-in-three chance of developing a disability that will last for more than three months.

And disability coverage could amount to a lot of money for someone who becomes disabled right at the beginning of their working life, Banerjee noted.

“Multiply (your annual income) for by a 40-year career, and you’re looking at millions of dollars,” he said.

But precisely because the chance of disability and the potential payouts tend to be high, private disability insurance is pricey.

For example, a 30-year old female non-smoker making $65,000 working in HR may pay something like $120 a month for a private LTD plan that kicks in after 90 days and pays out $3,500 a month, or 65 per cent of employment income, according to a quote provided to Global News by Lorne Marr, director of business development at LSM Insurance, an independent life insurance broker.

What to look for in a disability insurance policy

When advising clients about disability insurance, financial adviser Liz Schieck recommends clients choose regular- or own-occupation versus any-occupation as an eligibility criterion, as well as partial-disability as opposed to just total-disability coverage.

Story continues below advertisement

If you’re going to pay for it, you might as well choose a policy that’s more likely to actually result in a payout, she reckons.

READ MORE: Worried about outliving your retirement savings? There’s insurance for that

Regular-occupation coverage usually means you’ll be deemed eligible to receive payments if you can’t work in the job you had when you became disabled. Own-occupation coverage is even more generous and will pay out the full benefit even if your disability allows you to work in a different position. Banerjee offered the example of a surgeon who injured his hands. With own-occupation coverage, the doctor would be able to continue to receive 100 per cent of the payments even if she or he started, say, teaching at university.

Own-occupation coverage, which is more expensive, usually makes sense for high earners and people working in jobs that require very specific and not easily transferable skills, Schieck said.

Partial-disability coverage, on the other hand, guarantees that you’ll get some money, usually up to 50 per cent of the benefit, even if you are still able to perform some of your professional duties.

For Canadians with work disability benefits, one way to keep costs in check is to choose an individual policy that will only take effect when the criteria for workplace coverage switch to the more stringent any-occupation test, Banerjee said.

For example, take the woman in our earlier scenario — let’s call her Susie. Her monthly premium would decrease to $97 if she changed her so-called elimination period from 90 days to two years, according to Marr.

If that was still too much for Susie, she could further lower her monthly premium by reducing the amount of her benefit from 65 per cent of her pay to 50 per cent. That would bring the monthly cost of her policy down to $77 a month.

Of course, the catch is that Susie’s full benefit would also shrink from $3,500 to around $2,700 a month. But that isn’t as bad it may seem, Marr noted. The benefits aren’t subject to tax so a benefit that covers 65 per cent of gross salary will come quite close to someone’s after-tax income. A 50 per cent payout means Susie would get a bit less than that but still more than half of her take-home pay.

Banerjee recommended trimming back the payout amount rather than limiting the length of the coverage to anything less than the time you turn 65. And Schieck said a lower payout is also preferable to choosing stricter policies that apply the any-occupation or total-disability tests.

As for Fitzsimmons, he had actually taken a good look at his workplace disability benefits well before he had an inkling that he had cancer, he told Global News.

&amp;#x200B;

What is not fair is giving religion special treatment.",8.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

""Afterlife's conduct, aptly characterized as 'obituary piracy,' is high-handed, reprehensible and represented a marked departure from standards of decency,"" wrote Justice Catherine Kane.

Afterlife effectively copied and pasted obituaries and photographs that had been published elsewhere, and passed the content off as its own.

It was like someone had ripped my chest out again. - Raylene Manning-Puddister, grieving mom

It outraged families by selling memorial-themed products like candles and sympathy cards that unwitting friends and family could purchase — but with all the revenue going to Afterlife.

She ordered Afterlife — run by Pascal Leclerc — to pay $20 million in damages, and an injunction against the website to prevent it from operating in the future.

Leclerc initially hired a lawyer to handle his defence, but eventually backed out of the proceedings, leading to Kane issuing a default judgment.

Shock and disgust

Thomson's father, Denis Trainor, passed away in early 2017. A year later, she saw his obituary posted on Afterlife's website, where people could pay for things like digital flowers and candles.

""Ms. Thomson described her outrage and mortification that others would think she sought to profit from her father's death,"" wrote Kane.

While Thomson was the face case for the class action, the lawsuit was launched after events set in motion by a different grieving Newfoundlander.

Raylene Manning-Puddister was sitting at home one morning when she went to Google her son's baseball stats.

Although she has them memorized, she said, ""being a bereaved mom, it's just a dark road you walk every day of your life.""

Instead, she found his obituary as one of the top hits.

It was the same one she had written in 2012, when her 22-year-old-son, Tyller Pittman, passed away. To her surprise, it was posted on a site she had never seen before.

You would have a heart of stone if you were not moved by these people. - Erin Best, lawyer

""His obituary was literally word for word. The same pictures. There wasn't even any change in what I wrote myself.""

Afterlife had even used a poem Manning-Puddister had written for her son, placed alongside paid advertising and options to purchase digital tokens of sympathy.

""It was like someone had ripped my chest out again. I felt like I'd literally gotten kicked in the stomach,"" she said. ""Who in the world would do something so horrific to take advantage of bereaved parents, of people that lost their parents?""

Manning-Puddister called into CBC's St. John's Morning Show, where she shared her story and questioned how it was legal.

CBC then called Best to weigh in on whether it was copyright infringement. She later decided to file a lawsuit.

'They were absolutely devastated'

In her ruling, Kane said the site had infringed on copyrights by lifting the obituaries and photos of the deceased from other websites.

She awarded $10 million in statutory damages and $10 million in aggravated damages.

Best said once she announced she was filing a suit, she was bombarded with people who were furious, hurt, shocked and disgusted by Afterlife.

""You would have a heart of stone if you were not moved by these people,"" she said. ""They were absolutely devastated ... they felt like it was a kick in the stomach at their most vulnerable time.""

Whether any of the plaintiffs will see any money remains to be seen, Best said.

The site had posted more than one million Canadian obituaries at the time it was taken down. Afterlife now directs people to another website, Everhere, which the judge said is also run by Leclerc.

Everhere drew ire in Saskatchewan last year when families of victims of the Humboldt Broncos crash learned it was selling similar products without their permission.

Kane requested the injunction should name Leclerc personally, so he cannot continue posting obituaries on Everhere.

Sorry, pious liberal voters.",-19.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

Last year, the group was kicked out of an Annapolis Valley parade, and a Legion booking in Halifax was cancelled.

Two years ago, CBC News reported Garvey took part in an anti-immigration protest outside a school in Red Deer, Alta which included members of the group Worldwide Coalition Against Islam.

Garvey, then-leader of the National Advancement Party of Canada, a federally registered political party, said the intent of the protest was to raise awareness about the need to protect ""Canadian culture"" in schools.""

Garvey said the Legion is being intimidated by his political foes into shutting the party out of its halls, which he called censorship.

He said the party is looking into holding events at other venues.

Valerie Mitchell-Veinotte, executive director of the Legion's Nova Scotia-Nunavut command in Dartmouth, said the bookings were made in error.

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is defending a decision to give a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservative Party a role in determining which news organizations are eligible for government funding.

Eight Canadian organizations will select representatives to sit on an advisory panel that will decide how the government should dole out $600-million media support fund, the government announced Wednesday.

They are News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

Unifor — a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservatives under both Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer — represents more than 12,000 journalists and media workers in Canada.

In a statement posted to Facebook, Unifor said critics are mischaracterizing its role on the panel. The union says it will help define the criteria through which the funds will be allocated, but won't be directly involved in deciding who gets the money.

""There is a lot at stake as we work to protect and preserve our news industry in Canada and after years of discussion we finally have a path forward,"" the union said.

As It Happens has reached out to Unifor for comment.

Rodriguez spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the new panel. Here is part of their conversation.

I don't know if you had a chance to read Chris Selley at the National Post ... who says that that your putting Unifor on this panel is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. How do you respond?

We chose different organizations that represent journalists and different media across the country with different regions being represented, both official languages, the ethnic press.

We wanted to make sure that it was representative of the industry, and that's the reason why they're all there.

Why Unifor?

It represents thousands of employees from the news sector.

But it also represents a very, very strong bias, doesn't it? Because Unifor has made it quite clear that they call themselves ""the resistance."" They have put out publicity. I'm sure you've seen their publicity: ""The resistance: Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" If you want to have a panel that appears to be unbiased, how does that help you?

This is Andrew Scheer's opinion, and ...

Excuse me. No, no. This is not Andrew Scheer's opinion. I'm looking at a picture put out. This is Unifor Canada's picture.

We're talking about professionals, which is the case of all the groups there are on this list.

And the reason why we wanted to intervene is because professional journalism is one of the pillars of democracy. And the Conservatives may think that, ""Well, you know what? We shouldn't do anything and then let them all die.""

On the contrary, we're saying, ""No, we have to be there to support them with one clear principle — to respect the freedom and independence of the press.""

Unifor posted this image in a November 2018 tweet that read: 'Unifor’s National Executive Board started planning for the federal election today @AndrewScheer #canlab #canpoli.' (@UniforTheUnion/Twitter)

That's not the issue here. The issue is that you said you were going to put together a panel, an advisory panel, to decide who is going to get the funds, the $600 million worth of support to the media in this country, and that you would have an unbiased and an independent panel.

Yes, which is the case.

Mr. Rodriguez, have you not seen the publicity that Unifor is putting out calling themselves ""the resistance"" and saying, ""Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" Have you not seen that?

I know what you're talking about.

The Conservatives are saying that Unifor, any people working or any journalists, can be bought by this program, which is not the case, and I think it's an insult to professional journalists that build their career on integrity and on independence and on professionalism.

We're talking about the people on the panel. We're not talking about the journalists who might be benefiting from these funds. We saw that Unifor, it was quite partisan during the 2015 election campaign, that they put out attack ads against Stephen Harper's Conservatives, which surely helped you get elected. So, again, we're back to this problem of an appearance of bias. That if you have, if you are giving this position to Unifor, to the union, to decide who is going to get this funding, when it's an organization that has clearly come out ... going against your political enemies, that's a problem, isn't it?

This is repeating what Andrew Scheer is saying. And, again, I have to disagree with you, because if you look at the role the associations are playing, the role ... the journalists are playing, they're there to ask the tough questions — just exactly like what you're doing.

And also, this proves my point that we need that type of journalism of tough questions. And maybe the Conservatives, they don't want to hear those questions, but I think they're absolutely necessary in our democracy. So that's why the panel is in place. That's why we're moving forward.

But you've asked this panel to help decide who is a proper journalist and what's a proper news outlet and who is worthy of these funds. And who you've put on the panel that gets to decide that an organization that has a very, very strong, very partisan political statement.

But you keep repeating the same thing.

Because I'm not getting a very good answer from you.

I am answering your question and I'm saying that it's a panel with different people there from different sides of the industry, all representing professional journalists.

I guess what I'm trying to get to ... is that you want people to trust this fund, and Canadians want journalism they can trust. They want to believe that it's unbiased. But if the critics of your fund have always raised the alarm about any possible bias, that's why you wanted to have an independent panel. But haven't you just walked into that trap?

No, these panels represent people from all sides of industry. It represents work as a journalist, it represents the owners, it represents francophones, anglophones, the different regions, the ethnic media. It represents everybody.

And you don't think that there is a bias here, or a perception of bias, if you have as one of your panel members — and I know I'm asking you this once again, and I apologize for that, but I still haven't got a clear answer — do you not think that this is a problem of bias?

But I did answer your question.

You don't think that there's any bias on the part of Unifor, that Unifor doesn't have a political agenda?

No, you're saying that the journalists they represent have their own agenda.

No, no, I'm not saying that.

Yes, you're saying that.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm not. The panel you put together has Unifor as one of its members. And the question is that an organization that is clearly partisan and anti-Conservative, and have made that very clear, we're asking if that's an appropriate party to have on this panel?

We're saying that we need people from all walks of life. In this case ... people that represent the workers, the employers, the regions, the official languages and all of that to be represented there to make sure that this panel represents all of them, and that it takes neutral decisions on professional journalism.

Because we need professional journalism in our society. You're there to ask the tough questions. Again, that's exactly what you're doing and this is what we need.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Wednesday that the government continues to review “all potential suppliers” for Canada’s next generation of wireless networks from both a technological and national security perspective.

Goodale was speaking just before President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk, paving the way for a ban on doing business with China’s Huawei Technologies.

“We obviously pay careful attention to what our allies are saying and doing. Some have expressed views, others have not,” Goodale said outside the House of Commons.

“We’ll take all that into account, but we want to make the very best decision for Canada with respect to the technology and also on national security. Our national security will not be compromised.”

The U.S. has actively lobbied allies to keep Huawei technology out of American networks, suggesting it could be used to spy for Beijing.

Huawei has aggressively and repeatedly denied allegations it poses a national security threat.

Scheer government would ban Huawei from 5G networks

Meng Wanzhou says support from Huawei employees ‘beautiful as a spring breeze’

Extradition proceedings for Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou to begin in January

Canada has been reviewing Huawei’s involvement in the country’s 5G infrastructure — “5G” refers to the fifth generation of wireless technology, with each generation increasing how fast data can be transferred — for months.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said a government led by him would ban Huawei on national security grounds.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

“I believe there are many security concerns as it relates to Huawei and the development of Canada’s 5G. We know the government of China has acknowledged its role in certain cyber-attacks,” Scheer told reporters Wednesday.

“It’s up to the government of Canada to protect not just the personal information of Canadians but also the integrity of Canadian institutions.”

Trump’s order would have little impact on the main wireless carriers in the U.S., which do not employ Huawei products in their networks. According to Reuters, only about 25 per cent of smaller U.S. carriers use equipment from Huawei and another Chinese supplier, ZTE.

But a move by Trump to officially ban all Huawei products could be another salvo in the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.

A U.S. ban would also put constraints on what Ottawa can do. In an interview with Sky News last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo strongly suggested that the U.S. could limit intelligence sharing with countries that allow Huawei technology in their networks.

“We don’t believe you can have those technologies in your systems and still have a trusted network,” Pompeo

“But the United States, for its part, will only participate in trusted networks. We will only share America’s information with those networks that we are confident aren’t under the control of China . . . There’s really risk if countries choose that path, that we won’t be able to participate in those networks.”

A breakdown in intelligence sharing with the U.S. would have serious ramifications for Canada, which is a net importer of intelligence in the Five Eyes alliance, and is likely a consideration in the federal government’s review of the 5G file.

Goodale wouldn’t say Wednesday when that review will be released. Bloomberg News, citing unnamed government officials, reported last week that the Liberals could delay a decision until after October’s federal election.

Bernier has so far failed to parlay the significant political capital he had accumulated as a CPC leadership front-runner into a lasting electoral down payment for his People’s Party. If anything, he has depleted that capital.

Two years ago, one in two Conservative members supported Bernier’s bid to succeed Stephen Harper. For 12 of the 13 ballots it took to declare a winner, the leadership was his to lose.

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Maxime Bernier fails to gain momentum in Conservative territory

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

Since Bernier set out on his own last summer, Scheer’s Conservatives have vaulted to first place in voting intentions. Over the first quarter of this year, they raised more money than the ruling Liberals. Over the same period, Scheer’s personal ratings have improved while Bernier’s star has faded.

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

Get The Lead newsletter Start getting your whip-smart guide to Canada's 2019 federal election in your inbox. Sign Up Now

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

Provincial officials have told the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine (OIRM) that its $5 million in annual funding from the province will cease next March.

The Toronto-based institute provides grants to help Ontario researchers turn their their stem cell discoveries into treatments that are both medically and commercially viable.

The government's decision to terminate the funding is ""extremely short-sighted and uninformed,"" said Bernard Thébaud, a neonatal researcher who received funding from OIRM to explore the use of stem cells in preventing complications from premature birth.

""If [the government] would do a careful analysis, they would realize this is a worthwhile investment,"" said Thébaud, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and professor of pediatrics at the University of Ottawa.

Bernard Thébaud, a neonatologist at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and a senior scientist with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, says if the government would do a 'careful analysis' it would realize stem-cell research is a 'worthwhile investment.' (Canadian Lung Association)

His work has shown that stem cells isolated from the umbilical cord have the potential to prevent brain and lung damage in premature babies and promote healthy development of the organs as the children age.

""We believe this [research] could be a game-changer for these pre-term babies and could substantially improve their outcomes,"" Thébaud said Wednesday in an interview.

The funding to OIRM came from Ontario's Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. The minister responsible, Todd Smith, said the researchers can turn to the private sector.

""The previous government was throwing millions of dollars around like crazy and they were not holding anyone accountable as to how they were spending that money,"" Smith told reporters Wednesday at Queen's Park.

""What we've heard from the life-sciences sector is that a lot of these organizations don't actually need government money, that the private sector will step up,"" said Smith.

But scientists in the stem-cell field say the private sector is not willing to invest until their studies reach a late phase. To get there, they say government funding is crucial.

""We pick the really outstanding projects that have true potential and we fund them to the point where they can attract additional funding and then begin to move forward,"" said Duncan Stewart, president and scientific director of OIRM.

""Without a catalyst to kick-start the process, then it's not going to happen.""

The scientists see a bitter irony in the government's move, since stem cell research was born in Ontario. James Till and Ernest McCulloch discovered the existence of stem cells in 1961 at the Toronto-based Ontario Cancer Institute.

""It's very deflating, it's very disappointing to learn that this is going to not continue,"" said Stewart.

""The concern is that many great ideas, great technologies that could have blossomed into successful new opportunities commercially and new therapies for our patients just aren't going to move forward.""

Duncan Stewart, president and scientific director of the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine, is hopeful the government can be persuaded to renew OIRM's funding instead of stopping it. (Mike Crawley/CBC)

Research funded by OIRM attracted a $225-million investment by pharmaceutical giant Bayer and venture capital firm Versant Ventures to create BlueRock Therapeutics, now headquartered in Toronto. The company aims to treat heart disease and degenerative brain diseases.

""We were very excited about what we were able to accomplish with relatively modest funding,"" said Stewart.

The institute was created in 2014, with a promise from the Wynne government of $25 million over five years.

Stewart said he is hopeful the government can be persuaded to renew OIRM's funding instead of stopping it.

""We have a year, and a year is a long time in politics,"" said Stewart.

""We're hoping to use that time to try to position ourselves to continue in some way. Unfortunately, we have no idea what will happen after that."""

That would mean an industry gone in a country that doesn't have too many to begin with.,3.0,45.0,"Canadians' interest in cannabis-infused food is waning even as edibles are expected to become legal by mid-October, according to a new study that looks at changing attitudes toward marijuana.

The study out of Dalhousie University also found that 60 per cent of cannabis users continue to buy from the same supplier as they did before smoking pot became legal last year.

""The reason why they did that is for convenience, quality and most importantly price,"" lead author Sylvain Charlebois told CBC's Maritime Noon on Thursday.

""The price of cannabis in the black market is actually much lower, much more affordable than the legal cannabis.""

Charlebois said he believes when edibles become legal, it could actually continue to fuel the black market.

""The regulatory framework presented by Health Canada is so restrictive that it won't entice manufacturers in Canada to produce edibles,"" he said.

""If there is appetite to consume edibles — no pun — people will actually look for that product. And we may actually see more products being imported into Canada illegally to support that demand.""

Drop in legalization support

The study surveyed 1,051 Canadians over four days last month. The estimated margin of error is 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20. The aim was to compare attitudes before and after October 2018 legalization.

It found the number of Canadians in support of legalization in general fell by 19 per cent — and uncertainty about legalization rose by seven per cent. Only about six per cent of people reported starting using since legalization.

Of the 68 per cent of Canadians who were in favour of legalizing cannabis in 2017, 93 per cent of that group were willing to try an edible product. That dropped to 70 per cent in April.

""That's a significant drop,"" Charlebois said, adding it's probably for a number of different reasons — including media reports of specific incidents, such as when a four-year-old girl in Nova Scotia was hospitalized after accidentally ingesting cannabis-infused chocolate.

The study also found that Canadians are worried about edibles posing a greater risk to children (64 per cent) and pets (54 per cent).

Charlebois said he believes Health Canada has been focusing on mitigating the risk of cannabis products and not actually educating people.

""We figured out that Canadians are mostly cannabinoid illiterate,"" he said.

People are also concerned about privacy: almost half said they're uncertain about their co-workers knowing they use cannabis recreationally.

The study also found edibles carry less stigma than other forms of cannabis, and 20 per cent of respondents said while they don't use cannabis now, they might consider edibles once they become legal.

Charlebois said in Colorado, where marijuana is also legal, 50 per cent of all sales are edibles.

""The edible market in particular really has got a lot of people to consume cannabis, when really they didn't when only the dry stuff was legal. So we are expecting that to happen in Canada as well,"" he said.

While stigma wasn't something addressed in the 2017 study, Charlebois said the most recent findings suggest more than half of people believe retail facilities should be kept out of residential neighbourhoods. Less than 20 per cent said they're worried about being seen buying cannabis.

""The stigma was not as high or as strong as we thought it would be. However we have a long way to go from seeing cannabis become socially normalized in Canada,"" Charlebois said.

""And with restrictions, and in particular restrictions affecting edibles, that process may take much longer than expected."""

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."

Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil thanked Trudeau for providing ""a good start"" to the costs of cleaning up a lagoon near Pictou Landing First Nation contaminated by pulp mill waste accumulated over several decades.

The gratitude came as the two prepared to hold talks at an Antigonish community centre and the day after Ottawa pledged to spend $100 million to help clean up one of Nova Scotia's most polluted sites.

The Boat Harbour lagoons near the Pictou Landing First Nation are contaminated with millions of litres of treated waste water from the nearby Northern Pulp kraft pulp mill.

The federal money will be used to restore the lagoons to their natural state as a tidal estuary that empties into the Northumberland Strait.

Later in the evening during a speech to the party's annual meeting McNeil repeated his praise, and vowed to work hard to help the federal party in the fall federal election.

""The Trudeau government announced an ... investment in helping us deal with the wrong of Boat Harbour, and that cleanup will happen,"" said the premier.

However, as the two leaders met, a group of about a dozen protesters made clear that they're dissatisfied with the Trudeau government's measures to reduce carbon emissions — and its support of the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project.

Two members of the Extinction Rebellion direct action group were arrested for blocking traffic, saying as they were led away that carbon taxes introduced by the Trudeau government aren't going far enough in efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

As he was assisted into a police vehicle, Patrick Yancey said, ""I'm being arrested for refusing to move out of the way here, because we've tried everything else and we need the politicians to listen and get the climate targets in line with 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.""

A report last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, concluded that while it's technically possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, it is highly unlikely.

The report says achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement Canada signed onto would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy, including a shift away from fossil fuels.

Yancey's wife, Moraig MacGillivray, 40, said it was the second time her husband has been arrested and she expected he'd be released before long.

""We're here to send a message to Justin Trudeau that the climate emergency is urgent and the way the prime minister is investing in new pipelines is not the way to proceed,"" she said.

""As citizens we can't sit back and watch this any longer.""

In his speech to the Liberal partisans, Trudeau simply didn't mention a significant court victory supporting the Trans Mountain pipeline and expansion project his government has purchased for $4.5 billion.

Just hours earlier, the B.C. Court of Appeal ruled against the British Columbia government's efforts to stall the project, concluding it can't restrict oil shipments through its borders

Trudeau focused his speech on economic issues and a familiar litany of criticisms of the Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, whose party is now leading the Liberals in the polls.

The prime minister emphasized his government had co-operated with provincial counterparts — in contrast to former prime minister Stephen Harper's more confrontational approach with premiers.

He also cited the Trump administration's decision last week to lift its controversial tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum as an example that the federal Liberals remained focused on protecting jobs.

""Canadians are counting on us to continue to improve their standard of living,"" he told the audience.

I wonder whos next...",7.0,44.0,"TransCanada Corp. is officially dropping the ""Canada"" from its name, but CEO Russ Girling isn't saying he expects it will make it any easier to get pipelines approved in Canada or the United States.

The Calgary-based company is now to be called TC Energy Corp., after shareholders approved the change at its annual meeting Friday.

""The name TC Energy acknowledges our origin as TransCanada PipeLines, while adding the word 'energy' speaks to the breadth of our business, which includes pipelines, power generation and energy storage,"" Girling told the meeting.

""But to be clear, this is a name change, not a brand name. We are very proud of who we are and what we do.""

He declined to talk to reporters after the event.

The company said the change recognizes its growth into the United States and Mexico, including through its recent $13-billion US purchase of U.S. natural gas transporter Columbia Pipeline Group.

It has about 7,000 employees in North America, with 3,500 in Canada, 3,200 in the U.S. and 300 in Mexico.

But some analysts suggest it's also a chance to distance itself from Canada, where difficulty in getting pipeline projects approved has been blamed for a glut of oil that caused steep discount pricing last fall and prompted the Alberta government to curtail production starting in January.

""I think the name change is semantics,"" U.S.-based analyst Jennifer Rowland of Edward Jones wrote in an email.

""I don't think it attracts new investors, but I do think it's a subtle, or not so subtle depending on how you view it, way to de-emphasize Canada as some investors are leery of investing in Canada given the government intervention in free markets in Alberta and the difficult regulatory environment for energy.""

TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta into the U.S. was first proposed in 2008, rejected by then-president Barack Obama in 2015, approved by President Donald Trump in 2016 and again in March, but remains on hold awaiting court rulings in Montana and Nebraska.

The court delays mean the project will not be able to start construction in the U.S. this year, Paul Miller, president of liquids pipelines, confirmed during an afternoon conference call with financial analysts.

The project could still be unfinished if a new federal government is elected in the U.S. in 2020, he added, but it's hoped all permits and approvals will be in hand by then and a new administration won't affect bringing the project on stream.

Shareholders at the meeting voted almost 90 per cent against a motion sponsored by the Pension Plan of the United Church of Canada that would have required the company to report on how it is meeting international standards for Indigenous people's rights.

They went along with the company's recommendation to reject the motion as unnecessary given its existing policies.

The official approval of the name change came as the company reported a first-quarter profit of $1 billion of $1.09 per share, up from $734 million or 83 cents per share a year ago.

Revenue for the first quarter totalled $3.49 billion, compared with $3.42 billion in the first quarter of 2018.

On a comparable basis, TransCanada says it earned $987 million or $1.07 per share for the quarter, up from $864 million or 98 cents per share a year ago.

Analysts on average had expected a profit of 99 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon."

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

If you want far right, just fly to Alberta where they just elected a premier who believes in outing gay kids to their parents, doesn't believe in climate change, and is pro-life and anti-marriage equality because it goes against his religion.",0.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cannabis-use-statistics-canada-1.5121125,Here here!!,3.0,60.0,"More Canadians say they've used cannabis recreationally since it was legalized last fall, particularly those aged 45 to 64 and males, according to Statistics Canada.

About 18 per cent of Canadians 15 and older, or about 5.3 million people, reported pot use in the last three months, the federal agency said in its quarterly report on Thursday.

Early indications point to more use right after it was legalized last October, when the reported use stood at 14 per cent.

""One of the things … unique with this survey is the number of respondents who said they're using for the first time. So they started, in this case, in the post-legalization period,"" said Michelle Rotermann, a senior analyst in Statistics Canada's health analysis division.

In the first three months of 2018, about 330,000 Canadians said they'd tried cannabis for the first time. A year later, it was up to 650,000, she said.

J.F. Crépault, a senior policy analyst at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), says the Toronto facility wants to see if the initial spike in use translates into longer-term, problematic use.

Following legalization in Colorado, for instance, cannabis use spiked, then rates went back down to about the same as in surrounding states where it remains illegal, Crépault said.

""Researchers sometimes refer to this as a 'straw fire effect' in the sense that it kind of burns bright for a very short amount of time and then goes back down,"" he said.

The greatest proportion of users are aged 18 to 25 (30 per cent) compared with people in their mid-20s and older. But an increasing proportion of new users were aged 45 and older.

The average age of a cannabis user in the country is now 38, Rotermann said.

Many of them are men. Cannabis use increased among males, from 16 per cent last year to 22 per cent so far this year. There was no change among females.

Daily, or almost daily, use of cannabis was unchanged, while weekly and occasional use increased.

Crépault said doctors and medical researchers are looking for any long-term increases in the number of people using cannabis, and, more important, people using cannabis more frequently or more heavily or, ""even worse, starting to use it earlier in life.""

Crépault said at CAMH they're keeping an eye on the national quarterly reports, but recognize that rates of use are an imperfect indicator: Not everyone in the population who uses is harmed.

Early evidence coming out of U.S. states with easier access to medical cannabis or legalized non-medical use of cannabis shows there seem to be reductions in opioid-related overdoses and fatal overdoses. That could be because people are either self-medicating or obtaining opioid prescriptions legitimately and taking the drug long-term and switching to cannabis instead, Crépault said.

He noted that in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, harm-reduction proponents are unofficially providing free cannabis to those who use injection drugs to reduce their opioid intake.

""If cannabis use does increase in the population, we need to make sure that we're also keeping track of patterns of alcohol use or opioid use. It'll take a long time for us to know for sure what the kind of relationships are between these.""

Overall, 15 per cent of cannabis users with a valid driver's licence reported driving within two hours of consuming. That amounts to 675,000 people. Experts advise waiting more than two hours before driving.

Of that group, about 15 per cent, or 125,000 people, also reported they'd consumed alcohol as well — a first for the agency to report.

Police are watching for impaired driving from alcohol, cannabis and other substances. (CBC News)

""Any impaired driving is too much,"" Rotermann said, though she acknowledged that problems with impaired driving existed before legalization of cannabis.

An estimated 47 per cent of cannabis users, or 2.5 million Canadians, bought pot legally during that time, up from 23 per cent, or 954,000 people, during the same period a year ago.

As well, 38 per cent of users said they bought cannabis illegally during the first three months of 2019, compared with 51 per cent a year earlier."

Now on one last cross-Canada tour, the two are revisiting their old songbook while still releasing new material: ""The Hug Song"" came out in February, ""Talk About Peace"" featuring Jim Cuddy was released in May, and an illustrated book is coming this fall.

With sold-out shows dotting the country and a fanbase that still knows every word and movement to its songs, the trio that began haphazardly in 1978 is going out strong.

A backwards beginning

""We thought that we'd make the [first] album, it would be good fun, people would like it,"" says Bram. ""And we would continue on with our own solo careers.""

""Which we did,"" counters Sharon.

""That ambition did not last very long,"" adds Bram.

""No, exactly,"" she agrees.

Sharon and Bram came up in the '60s coffee-house scene in Toronto, an upbringing they credit for the folk spine of their wildly popular repertoire. Bram was also a school teacher in North York with the Toronto Board of Education for seven years, and spent five of those years as an ""itinerant music teacher in special education.""

""That was a real learning experience for me, about how to be with kids, and what kind of things they like, and how to present those things, and how to connect with them,"" he says.

Lois was the only one of them with formal music training: a pianist, she had a classical music degree from the University of Michigan.

It was Ontario's Mariposa in the Schools — a performing arts program that ""put performers like ourselves into classrooms on a freelance basis to sing with children in schools,"" says Sharon — that brought them together. The program had been planning to record a collaborative album with its freelance singers, but that project had stalled. Sharon, Lois & Bram still wanted to make an album — so they went ahead anyway.

That album was 1978's One Elephant, Deux Éléphants, which they funded with their own money, plus money from friends and family who ""thought they were giving us charity — and we paid them back very quickly, actually,"" assures Bram. The trio conceived of the album at the beginning of 1978; released it in September; paid everyone back by Christmas. The album went triple platinum, and secured Sharon, Lois & Bram's first Juno nomination.

""It never occurred to us, not once, to take an idea to a record company and say, 'OK, we've got this record in mind, would you finance it and distribute it?"" says Bram. ""Never thought of doing that at all. We knew, just in our guts, that we had to do this on our own. Because we knew that we knew more about children and family music than anybody in a suit at a record company.""

We did it backwards: we made the record first. And while we were doing it, we learned how to sing together. — Bram Morrison

Bram does point out that, because of their less traditional trio narrative, they may have done things in a different order than usual.

""Usually what happens, the group gets together, and they practise in mom's garage, and then they go to somewhere slightly bigger,"" he says. ""And after a couple of years, they decide, 'Hey, let's make a record.' But we did it backwards, we made the record first. And while we were doing it we learned how to sing together.""

Sharon laughs, and points out that they were lucky all their voices naturally blended well together — though it took some work to find those harmonies.

""Sharon was the only one who had had any experience singing harmony,"" explains Bram. ""I was certainly a solo. And Lois was, too. And so on the first record, you hear Sharon singing a lot of harmony.""

""It used to drive me crazy,"" Sharon quickly adds, laughing again.

But they figured it out. And the rest — increasingly large tours (eventually with symphony orchestras), six Juno nominations and three wins, a billing at the White House, a popular TV show featuring a particular elephant — is history.

'We wanted to choose songs that we liked'

Ironically, Sharon and Bram credit their enduring success to never pandering to children.

""We wanted to choose repertoire that would appeal to children, but also appeal to the family,"" explains Sharon. ""So they wouldn't run screaming from the room. We wanted to choose songs that we liked.""

""[Our shows] were called family events and not children's records and children's concerts,"" Bram continues. ""We really wanted to appeal to the whole range of the family. And so our musicians were good, professional musicians. Our arrangers were very sophisticated. And we learned how to fit in with all that.""

""We were intent on the standards being very high,"" adds Sharon. ""We spent money to do that. We did not skimp, we did not take the cheapest way out. And I think that helped build our audience.""

That audience has a retention rate going on 40 years. Even at these farewell shows — of which a second one was added in Halifax on the Sunday due to popularity — adults show up without children.

""We see audiences of adults who grew up on us and who treasure those memories and want to revisit them, which is what this tour of course is about,"" says Sharon.

Those memories are also coming up vividly for Sharon and Bram: their farewell tour is ending in one of the venues where the two of them started, at the Mariposa Folk Festival in Orillia, Ont., in July.

While Mariposa in the Schools is what brought Sharon, Lois & Bram together, the festival is where Sharon and Bram were each playing before they amassed the affection of most families in Canada (""You were also in the Mariposa Folk Festival and I have the poster to prove it,"" Bram jokes, when Sharon talks at length about his shows at the festival).

""Also later on in the process, Lois and I organized the children's area at the Mariposa Festival, which was probably the best ever,"" says Sharon. ""So yes ... we're going back to Mariposa this summer. Kind of a nice, as Bram says, book end.""

Currently, almost none do for batteries, but the potential is there if they so choose.  These sorts of things show up all over the place, from Apple locking you out if you replace the screen on your phone with an after-market one, to companies like HP and Lenovo preventing you from replacing the wireless adapter in your notebook.",3.0,902.0,"A Canadian non-profit that advocates for an open and affordable internet wants Ottawa to make electronic devices like smartphones easier to fix.

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,"The point regarding fairness is completely reasonable, and I'm inclined to agree. So any outward expression of a person's religious beliefs should be banned for public servants?

No Christian public servants will be allowed to wear cross necklaces either? Jewish public servants won't be allowed to wear their kippah? I'm an atheist and I don't think I'll be judged fairly and objectively by a judge who's wearing either of those things, in addition to Muslim hijab.",2.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/transmountain-pipeline-environment-question-1.5147454,So you don’t mind consuming the products you just resent Alberta extracting it and shipping it.,4.0,27.0,"B.C.'s Court of Appeal will decide Friday whether the province can change its environmental laws in a way that could effectively kill the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.

The province's top court was asked to weigh in on proposed amendments to B.C.'s Environmental Management Act forcing anyone wanting to transport increased quantities of ""heavy oil"" to seek provincial permission.

While B.C.'s attorney general argues the government has the right to enact laws aimed at protecting British Columbians from the effects of a catastrophic spill, Ottawa claims the move is a ruse designed with just one target in mind: the proposed twinning of a 1,150 pipeline to move bitumen from Edmonton to the West Coast.

The case revolves around weighty legal and constitutional issues, but it boils down to a few fundamental questions about the role of government in the lives of Canadians — and the balance between local and national interests.

In his opening arguments, Joseph Arvay, counsel for B.C., pointed to the array of lawyers for ""pipelines and railways and others in the oil and gas industry"" who had lined up to oppose him.

He claimed their arguments all boiled down to one thing:

""That even if the pipelines or railways they own or operate create a risk of even catastrophic environmental harm because of the substance they carry, the province is nevertheless powerless to enact laws to prevent that risk from materializing,"" Arvay told the five appeal court judges.

""We say that the province is not required to accept such a fate.""

'A Trojan horse'

The appeal court battle is the latest in a series of legal and political hurdles the pipeline expansion has faced since then-owner Kinder Morgan first lodged its plans with the National Energy Board (NEB) in 2013.

Last year, the federal government announced plans to buy the $4.5 billion pipeline from Kinder Morgan shareholders, who expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the approval process.

The Federal Court of Appeal put the project on hold in 2018 after finding that the government had not adequately consulted with First Nations and the NEB had failed to fully consider impacts on marine life.

Ottawa has since moved to rectify those shortcomings.

The reference question was debated over five days in March. It's one of the rare proceedings B.C.'s appeal court has decided to webcast.

Jan Brongers, lawyer for Canada's attorney general, acknowledged the ""superficial attraction"" of Arvay's argument. But he warned the judges against falling for it.

""Our main concern is that this legislation appears to be a Trojan horse,"" he said.

""It's one that's designed to appear as constitutionally acceptable local environmental protection measures, but in substance it's an unconstitutional initiative whose only logical reason for being is to limit federally regulated pipelines and railways from moving additional quantities of heavy oil.""

The court has been asked to consider three basic questions:

Does B.C. have the authority to enact the proposed amendments?

Would those rules apply to ""heavy oil"" from another province?

Would existing federal legislation trump the provincial rules in any event?

The federal government argued that it has exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines and railways, and that B.C.'s legislation is simply a bid to kill a project the provincial NDP government vigorously opposes.

But Arvay claimed B.C. isn't trying to usurp Ottawa's power — that instead the proposed amendments would work in tandem with federal laws to ensure locals are protected from the risks of projects in their backyards.

""Decisions affecting individuals should as far as reasonably possible be made by the level of government closest to the individuals affected,"" he told the court.

Strange bedfellows

A host of intervenors have lined up on either side of the debate, with the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby supporting British Columbia along with the Assembly of First Nations.

""Local governments and First Nations governments are on the front lines of emergency response for their communities,"" the City of Vancouver said in its written arguments.

""It is these communities that are at risk from a heavy oil accident and who will suffer the impacts.""

Several individual First Nations have also aligned themselves with the government of Canada, along with a number of oil and gas industry groups and the attorneys general of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Alberta said the provinces and Ottawa should work together to protect the environment, but B.C. can't take unilateral steps that would result in the obstruction or delay of the project.

Regardless of what the appeal court decides, the ultimate decision on the law is likely to rest with the Supreme Court of Canada."

""Tax cheats can no longer hide,"" National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier promised in 2017.

Now, Tax Court documents obtained by CBC News/Radio-Canada show two members of the Cooper family in Victoria, as well as the estate of the late patriarch Peter Cooper, reached an out-of-court settlement on May 24 over their involvement in the scheme.

Details of the settlement and even minutes of the meetings discussing it are under wraps. A CBC News/Radio-Canada reporter who showed up to one such meeting this spring left after realizing it was closed to the public.

Journalists discovered references to the final settlement agreement in Tax Court documents only by chance.

CRA cites privacy in keeping settlement details secret

The Canada Revenue Agency says strict privacy provisions of Canadian tax law make it difficult to disclose minutes describing individual taxpayer information.

The Isle of Man tax dodge had been active as far back as 1999 and, according to documents filed in Tax Court by the CRA in 2015, had ""intended to deceive"" federal regulators.

Still, significant details of the scheme remain a mystery, including the role played by the KPMG's senior executives. With no public trial, those details may continue to remain secret.

Toby Sanger, executive director of the advocacy group Canadians for Tax Fairness, says the CRA should never have agreed to settle the case.

""I think it's outrageous,"" he said. ""We've had a lot of tough talk and promises from this minister about how they will crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy and corporations, but unfortunately, we've seen no evidence of this so far.""

Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier said in an email statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête that while she cannot comment on specific cases, she finds the lack of transparency about settlements brokered by her agency ""problematic.""

""I have instructed the CRA to review its processes to allow for more transparency with respect to the reasons for which a settlement is reached,"" she said.

KPMG took 15% cut of taxes dodged

One member of the Cooper family, Marshall Cooper, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s and that it was KPMG that came up with the offshore tax plan.

Documents show KPMG planned to take a 15 per cent cut of the taxes dodged, including $300,000 from the Cooper family. Internal records show the scheme was marketed across the country, with successful KPMG sales agents and accountants referred to as product ""champions.""

Marshall Cooper, pictured, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s. (Facebook)

In all, more than 20 wealthy families participated in the offshore scheme.

Two years ago, Lebouthillier issued a news release outlining her intention to clamp down on the KPMG scheme, publicly stating that those involved could even face criminal charges over possible ""tax fraud.""

""The case of KPMG is before the courts right now, and we continue to pursue action against KPMG,"" Lebouthillier said in 2017 in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""We will see this to the end as Canadians have asked us to do.""

She said at the time that her government took the matter ""very seriously.""

""Those who choose to participate in these schemes must face the consequences of their actions,"" she said in a separate statement.

Yet more than two years after that pledge, participants in the KPMG scheme, namely, members of the Cooper family, were offered a secret out-of-court settlement.

In her statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête this week, Lebouthillier said the decision to settle was not hers to make and that she had instructed the CRA to review its settlements to ""allow for more transparency.""

Minister says 'systemic changes' are coming

To ""ensure integrity of our tax system,"" Lebouthillier said, out-of-court settlements are made by the CRA and the Department of Justice ""at arm's length"" from the minister and the minister's office.

""Canadians deserve a fair and equitable tax system, and we will continue to make systemic changes within the CRA to make sure that this is the case,"" she said in her statement this week.

CBC News/Radio-Canada first revealed four years ago that KPMG, one of the largest accounting firms in Canada, with tens of millions in federal contracts, had for years been running a massive offshore tax dodge for wealthy clients it had kept hidden from federal investigators.

The Trudeau government's previous tough talk on the so-called sham had come after a document leaked to The Fifth Estate/Enquête showed the CRA itself had offered a secret ""no penalties"" amnesty in May 2015 to many of the KPMG clients involved in the scheme.

The CRA offered to have them simply pay the back taxes owed — but with the condition they not tell the public about the offer.

Liberal MPs halted a parliamentary finance committee investigation in 2016 after KPMG argued the investigation could prejudice court cases. Now, it looks like those court cases might never happen. (CBC)

Stung by those revelations, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in 2017 that the government had learned a lesson from the KPMG affair and promised to do a ""better job of getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.""

Since then, the Liberal government vowed to make sure those kinds of offshore tax dodges were in the past.

In fact, it was concerns over future KPMG court cases that prompted the Liberal-dominated House of Commons finance committee to shut down its own investigation into the embattled accounting firm back in 2016.

Documents had already begun to emerge detailing the extent to which KPMG was helping clients not only dodge taxes but also hide money from potential creditors, including circumventing the Canadian Divorce Act by ""protecting"" assets from ex-spouses.

Lawyers for KPMG had argued that the ongoing finance committee investigation could prejudice cases before the court.

Several KPMG executives had been named to testify in the spring of 2016, but Liberal MPs voted to shut down the inquiry, arguing that any more testimony and documents should be produced in court and not in Parliament.

Now, it appears that those future court cases cited as a reason for shutting down the investigation might never materialize.

The Fifth Estate and Enquête also later revealed that in June 2016, around the same time the Liberal MPs shut down their investigation, a former senior KPMG executive was appointed to the Liberal Party's national board of directors.

""There is no reason why the finance committee shouldn't restart their hearings,"" Canadians for Tax Fairness's Sanger said.

Settlements offer 'substantial savings to the public'

Sanger said it all seems like a Liberal ""coverup"" to close down the KPMG investigation.

Canadians still do not know who were the key people at KPMG involved in running the investigation, for example, how high up it went within the organization, or all the names of the wealthy clients who participated.

Max Weder, the lawyer for the Cooper family, said he ""can't comment on the settlement.""

Documents show the family paid virtually no tax over a span of eight years — and even obtained federal and provincial tax credits — despite receiving nearly $6 million from an offshore company worth $26 million that KPMG helped set up.

KPMG has always maintained the scheme was legal. The firm's lawyers claimed any money the Coopers received were gifts and therefore non-taxable. Nevertheless, KPMG now says it would not set up this type of offshore structure anymore.

For its part, the CRA said that the settlement was made in accordance with the law and is ""supported by the facts of this particular case."" The agency also said it ""maximized revenue"" by making a decision to settle out of court, instead of facing an uncertain ruling in Tax Court.

""There is generally substantial savings to the public and a benefit to the justice system when cases are resolved through a settlement,"" a CRA spokesperson said in a statement.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cannabis-use-statistics-canada-1.5121125,My 65 year old boss tried it for the first time on good Friday. He hasn't stopped talking about how much fun he had.,22.0,60.0,"More Canadians say they've used cannabis recreationally since it was legalized last fall, particularly those aged 45 to 64 and males, according to Statistics Canada.

About 18 per cent of Canadians 15 and older, or about 5.3 million people, reported pot use in the last three months, the federal agency said in its quarterly report on Thursday.

Early indications point to more use right after it was legalized last October, when the reported use stood at 14 per cent.

""One of the things … unique with this survey is the number of respondents who said they're using for the first time. So they started, in this case, in the post-legalization period,"" said Michelle Rotermann, a senior analyst in Statistics Canada's health analysis division.

In the first three months of 2018, about 330,000 Canadians said they'd tried cannabis for the first time. A year later, it was up to 650,000, she said.

J.F. Crépault, a senior policy analyst at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), says the Toronto facility wants to see if the initial spike in use translates into longer-term, problematic use.

Following legalization in Colorado, for instance, cannabis use spiked, then rates went back down to about the same as in surrounding states where it remains illegal, Crépault said.

""Researchers sometimes refer to this as a 'straw fire effect' in the sense that it kind of burns bright for a very short amount of time and then goes back down,"" he said.

The greatest proportion of users are aged 18 to 25 (30 per cent) compared with people in their mid-20s and older. But an increasing proportion of new users were aged 45 and older.

The average age of a cannabis user in the country is now 38, Rotermann said.

Many of them are men. Cannabis use increased among males, from 16 per cent last year to 22 per cent so far this year. There was no change among females.

Daily, or almost daily, use of cannabis was unchanged, while weekly and occasional use increased.

Crépault said doctors and medical researchers are looking for any long-term increases in the number of people using cannabis, and, more important, people using cannabis more frequently or more heavily or, ""even worse, starting to use it earlier in life.""

Crépault said at CAMH they're keeping an eye on the national quarterly reports, but recognize that rates of use are an imperfect indicator: Not everyone in the population who uses is harmed.

Early evidence coming out of U.S. states with easier access to medical cannabis or legalized non-medical use of cannabis shows there seem to be reductions in opioid-related overdoses and fatal overdoses. That could be because people are either self-medicating or obtaining opioid prescriptions legitimately and taking the drug long-term and switching to cannabis instead, Crépault said.

He noted that in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, harm-reduction proponents are unofficially providing free cannabis to those who use injection drugs to reduce their opioid intake.

""If cannabis use does increase in the population, we need to make sure that we're also keeping track of patterns of alcohol use or opioid use. It'll take a long time for us to know for sure what the kind of relationships are between these.""

Overall, 15 per cent of cannabis users with a valid driver's licence reported driving within two hours of consuming. That amounts to 675,000 people. Experts advise waiting more than two hours before driving.

Of that group, about 15 per cent, or 125,000 people, also reported they'd consumed alcohol as well — a first for the agency to report.

Police are watching for impaired driving from alcohol, cannabis and other substances. (CBC News)

""Any impaired driving is too much,"" Rotermann said, though she acknowledged that problems with impaired driving existed before legalization of cannabis.

An estimated 47 per cent of cannabis users, or 2.5 million Canadians, bought pot legally during that time, up from 23 per cent, or 954,000 people, during the same period a year ago.

As well, 38 per cent of users said they bought cannabis illegally during the first three months of 2019, compared with 51 per cent a year earlier."

The new regulations announced Friday will be launched in two phases. Some regulations come into force on July 15, while others will not take effect until December 15.

""Our goal was to provide a world-leading approach to air passenger rights that would be predictable and fair for passengers while ensuring our air carriers remain strong and competitive,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement.

""After a long and thorough consultation process, I am proud to say these new regulations achieve that balance and will give air travellers the rights and treatment they pay for and deserve,"" he added.

The regulations will apply to all flights to, from and within Canada, including connecting flights. Large airlines, those that have serviced two million passengers or more in the last two years, will have a slightly different regulatory regime than smaller airlines in some cases.

Smaller airlines, for example, will have to pay less compensation for delays or cancellations that are within the airline's control but are not related to safety issues.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau announces new regulations and penalties for airlines related to air travel delays. 1:50

Broadly, flight disruptions — tarmac delays, flight cancellations, and denials of boarding — that are within an airline's control require compensation be paid, standards of treatment be upheld and the passenger's itinerary be completed.

Flight disruptions within an airline's control but required for safety reasons will not require compensation but airlines will have to maintain a standard of treatment and complete a passenger's itinerary.

Situations outside an airline's control that cause a flight disruption will only require the airline to ensure the passenger's itinerary is completed.

Situations within an airline's control include overbooking and scheduled maintenance.

Delays within an airline's control due to safety include mechanical problems and safety calls made by the pilot.

Disruptions outside an airline's control include a wide range of possibilities such as political instability, weather, natural disasters and security threats.

Rules in place by July 15

The first set of rules lays out the regulations and compensation regime related to delays on the tarmac, what happens when a passenger is denied boarding, lost and damaged luggage and the transportation of musical instruments.

The standards of treatment during a delay on the tarmac that must be in force by July 15 include ensuring that all passengers have access to working toilets.

An airline will also have to ensure the aircraft is properly ventilated and kept either cool or warm depending on the time of year. Passengers will also have to be provided food and drink and the ability to communicate with people outside of the plane free of charge, if possible.

Planes that have been on the tarmac for three hours will be required to return to the gate so people can get off. The only exception is when a departure is likely within the first 45 minutes after the three-hour time. In that case, the plane can remain where it is.

Overbooking

Starting July 15, passengers who are prevented from boarding an aircraft because of overbooking will be compensated financially depending on the length of time they are delayed from reaching their final destination.

Overbooking delays of less than six hours will require a minimum $900 payment, delays between six and nine hours mean a minimum $1,800 payment and delays longer than nine hours will see passengers compensated a minimum of $2,400.

When it comes to lost or damaged baggage, an airline will be liable for $2,100 for the lost bag and will also have to refund any baggage fees paid for the lost bag.

Airlines are also going to have to include terms and conditions for the transportation of musical instruments whether they are taken as a carry on or are checked into the cargo hold.

Phase two

The rules and compensation for cancelled flights and delays are part of phase two of the rollout.

As of December 15, airlines will have to provide compensation to passengers for delayed or cancelled flights depending on the size of the airline.

Delayed arrival at a final destination of between three to six hours will cost large airlines $400 and small airlines $125. Delays of between six to nine hour will cost large airlines $700 and small airlines $250. Delays greater than nine hours will cost large airlines $1,000 and smaller airlines half that amount.

The regulations do not only require an airline ensure the passenger gets to their final destination, but that they do so in the same class of service.

If an airline cannot rebook a passenger on their own airline and the delay is longer than nine hours, the airline has to book the passenger on a competing airline. If the passenger decides the delay has rendered the trip useless they will get a refund and the required financial compensation.

By mid December, airlines will also have to ensure that children under the age of five are seated next to their parent or guardian, children aged five to 11 are in the same row and no more than one seat away from their parent or guardian and children aged 12 or 13 are no more than one row away.

Airlines that don't adhere to the new standards can be fined up to $25,000 per incident by the Canadian Transport Agency.

""Thousands of Canadians participated in the consultations that helped shape these new rules,"" Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency, said in a statement.

""We're grateful for their input, and confident that these groundbreaking regulations will help ensure passengers are treated fairly if their air travel doesn't go smoothly,"""

Anybody but Trudeau.",26.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

Social media giants ignore law, don’t take Canada seriously, say MPs

Star Editorial | Christchurch Call is a good step in fighting extremism

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

Premier Bob McLeod is laying out a vision for the North's future that includes an increased military presence and major development of Arctic waters for transportation.

""We need to position Canada's North as a central international transport hub for the future of the Arctic and we see significant more infrastructure investment required,"" McLeod said in a recent interview with CBC Politics in Ottawa.

McLeod said he'll be presenting this and other ideas to the federal government in Ottawa within the next month.

The premier wants Canada to triple its icebreaker fleet within five years and triple its deepwater port capacity within 10 years.

""I think that you see other Arctic countries becoming significant players in the Arctic and we need to be sure that Canada and the North is ready for when that happens,"" McLeod said.

Both China and Russia have shown growing interest in the Arctic. The Barents Observer of Norway reported in February that Russia plans to use supersonic jet fighters to make regular patrols of the North Pole, something Russia hasn't done since the Cold War.

McLeod said Inuvik, located 100 kilometres from the Beaufort Sea, should play a key security role.

""We'd like to see a full military base, preferably in Inuvik, of about 5,000 permanent personnel,"" he said.

While the federal government announced last fall that Yellowknife will be home to a new Arctic Region Coast Guard base, McLeod said there should be a base in the Beaufort Sea.

Officials from all three northern territories are meeting in Yellowknife on Wednesday. The Arctic Security Working Group will discuss safety, security and defence issues, along with the commander of the Canadian Forces' Joint Task Force North.

It's unknown whether McLeod's vision of a more militarized North will be part of the federal government's much-anticipated Arctic Policy Framework, which may be released as early as June.

The new Arctic policy initiative was announced in December 2016 to replace the 2009 Northern Strategy and the 2010 Statement on Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy under Stephen Harper's Conservative government.

The current federal government recently added foreign affairs and national security, as well as reconciliation, to the list of themes the new policy will address.

""We've been working with the government of Canada on a 10-year vision and plan for Arctic Canada and I've been going to a lot of Arctic conferences and realizing that Canada is falling way far behind the other Arctic countries,"" McLeod said.

""So we're coming up with a plan where the Arctic will become a critical international arena of economics, science and infrastructure and environment strategy.""

Icebreaker U

In order to increase understanding of the Arctic, McLeod envisions a Canada-wide civil service rotation program in which senior bureaucrats from the South spend time living in the North. He'd also like to see a federal department of Arctic affairs and a northern immigration program.

""We think that we need more immigration and the fact is we don't have enough people up here. We're also looking at having a permanent offshore Arctic university school on one of the existing icebreakers,"" he said.

McLeod said he takes climate change and Arctic ecology ""very, very seriously."" His vision for the N.W.T., however, remains steeped in fostering transportation corridors and pipelines to accommodate the oil and gas industry.

McLeod says innovation is needed to find alternate energy sources for 20 diesel-dependent communities beyond solar and wind, given that neither of those can supply continuous, year-round power to communities.

McLeod has been premier of the N.W.T. since 2011. He is the MLA for the riding of Yellowknife South. The next territorial election is Oct. 1."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/flood-plains-1.5135336,Lethbridge?,3.0,109.0,"Note to outraged conservative readers: this opinion column was not assigned by Katie Telford. (The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

Five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

More on that next week."

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

Claire Avery, a rugby player at Charles P. Allen High School, said she and her teammates were shocked and devastated by the news.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is defending a decision to give a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservative Party a role in determining which news organizations are eligible for government funding.

Eight Canadian organizations will select representatives to sit on an advisory panel that will decide how the government should dole out $600-million media support fund, the government announced Wednesday.

They are News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

Unifor — a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservatives under both Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer — represents more than 12,000 journalists and media workers in Canada.

In a statement posted to Facebook, Unifor said critics are mischaracterizing its role on the panel. The union says it will help define the criteria through which the funds will be allocated, but won't be directly involved in deciding who gets the money.

""There is a lot at stake as we work to protect and preserve our news industry in Canada and after years of discussion we finally have a path forward,"" the union said.

As It Happens has reached out to Unifor for comment.

Rodriguez spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the new panel. Here is part of their conversation.

I don't know if you had a chance to read Chris Selley at the National Post ... who says that that your putting Unifor on this panel is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. How do you respond?

We chose different organizations that represent journalists and different media across the country with different regions being represented, both official languages, the ethnic press.

We wanted to make sure that it was representative of the industry, and that's the reason why they're all there.

Why Unifor?

It represents thousands of employees from the news sector.

But it also represents a very, very strong bias, doesn't it? Because Unifor has made it quite clear that they call themselves ""the resistance."" They have put out publicity. I'm sure you've seen their publicity: ""The resistance: Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" If you want to have a panel that appears to be unbiased, how does that help you?

This is Andrew Scheer's opinion, and ...

Excuse me. No, no. This is not Andrew Scheer's opinion. I'm looking at a picture put out. This is Unifor Canada's picture.

We're talking about professionals, which is the case of all the groups there are on this list.

And the reason why we wanted to intervene is because professional journalism is one of the pillars of democracy. And the Conservatives may think that, ""Well, you know what? We shouldn't do anything and then let them all die.""

On the contrary, we're saying, ""No, we have to be there to support them with one clear principle — to respect the freedom and independence of the press.""

Unifor posted this image in a November 2018 tweet that read: 'Unifor’s National Executive Board started planning for the federal election today @AndrewScheer #canlab #canpoli.' (@UniforTheUnion/Twitter)

That's not the issue here. The issue is that you said you were going to put together a panel, an advisory panel, to decide who is going to get the funds, the $600 million worth of support to the media in this country, and that you would have an unbiased and an independent panel.

Yes, which is the case.

Mr. Rodriguez, have you not seen the publicity that Unifor is putting out calling themselves ""the resistance"" and saying, ""Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" Have you not seen that?

I know what you're talking about.

The Conservatives are saying that Unifor, any people working or any journalists, can be bought by this program, which is not the case, and I think it's an insult to professional journalists that build their career on integrity and on independence and on professionalism.

We're talking about the people on the panel. We're not talking about the journalists who might be benefiting from these funds. We saw that Unifor, it was quite partisan during the 2015 election campaign, that they put out attack ads against Stephen Harper's Conservatives, which surely helped you get elected. So, again, we're back to this problem of an appearance of bias. That if you have, if you are giving this position to Unifor, to the union, to decide who is going to get this funding, when it's an organization that has clearly come out ... going against your political enemies, that's a problem, isn't it?

This is repeating what Andrew Scheer is saying. And, again, I have to disagree with you, because if you look at the role the associations are playing, the role ... the journalists are playing, they're there to ask the tough questions — just exactly like what you're doing.

And also, this proves my point that we need that type of journalism of tough questions. And maybe the Conservatives, they don't want to hear those questions, but I think they're absolutely necessary in our democracy. So that's why the panel is in place. That's why we're moving forward.

But you've asked this panel to help decide who is a proper journalist and what's a proper news outlet and who is worthy of these funds. And who you've put on the panel that gets to decide that an organization that has a very, very strong, very partisan political statement.

But you keep repeating the same thing.

Because I'm not getting a very good answer from you.

I am answering your question and I'm saying that it's a panel with different people there from different sides of the industry, all representing professional journalists.

I guess what I'm trying to get to ... is that you want people to trust this fund, and Canadians want journalism they can trust. They want to believe that it's unbiased. But if the critics of your fund have always raised the alarm about any possible bias, that's why you wanted to have an independent panel. But haven't you just walked into that trap?

No, these panels represent people from all sides of industry. It represents work as a journalist, it represents the owners, it represents francophones, anglophones, the different regions, the ethnic media. It represents everybody.

And you don't think that there is a bias here, or a perception of bias, if you have as one of your panel members — and I know I'm asking you this once again, and I apologize for that, but I still haven't got a clear answer — do you not think that this is a problem of bias?

But I did answer your question.

You don't think that there's any bias on the part of Unifor, that Unifor doesn't have a political agenda?

No, you're saying that the journalists they represent have their own agenda.

No, no, I'm not saying that.

Yes, you're saying that.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm not. The panel you put together has Unifor as one of its members. And the question is that an organization that is clearly partisan and anti-Conservative, and have made that very clear, we're asking if that's an appropriate party to have on this panel?

We're saying that we need people from all walks of life. In this case ... people that represent the workers, the employers, the regions, the official languages and all of that to be represented there to make sure that this panel represents all of them, and that it takes neutral decisions on professional journalism.

Because we need professional journalism in our society. You're there to ask the tough questions. Again, that's exactly what you're doing and this is what we need.

Standing up in front of the world and telling China that there will be no trade deal until the Canucks that have been detained are back on home soil would be a start.  Demanding that China also apologize to Canada for their childish tantrum in the wake of the arrest of MW is also essential.  Actually, I'd give a testicle to see the USA demand that China apologize and normalize relations with Canada in exchange for continuing trade negotiations.",7.0,73.0,"The United States Senate has passed a resolution praising the Canadian government for the way it has conducted itself in the case of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

The resolution commends ""the government of Canada for upholding the rule of law and expressing concern over actions by the government of the People's Republic of China in response to a request from the United States government to the government of Canada for the extradition of a Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. executive.""

The resolution is nonbinding and is considered an expression of the Senate's will on the issue.

Canada has face widespread political and economic pressure from China since Meng's arrest in December and has been looking to its international allies for diplomatic assistance.

In February, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland met with U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, to ask for American help in its ongoing tussle with China over Meng's arrest. Risch ultimately introduced the Senate resolution.

Since Meng's arrest, China has placed a number of trade hurdles in front of Canadian exporters — banning imports from two canola producers, tying up shipments over paperwork and putting unusual obstacles in the way of Canadian soybean and pea exporters.

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December after Canadian officials detained Meng in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S. She was later granted bail and is now awaiting court proceedings.

In March, China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission accused Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him by Spavor.

'Arbitrary detention'

In December, a few months before that accusation was made, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Kovrig and Spavor were being unlawfully detained and should be returned to Canada.

That position was affirmed by the Senate Tuesday in a resolution that expressed concern over China's ""apparent arbitrary detention and abusive treatment of Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in apparent retaliation for the government of Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou.""

One month after Kovrig and Spavor were arrested, China sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial in January. Schellenberg already had been sentenced to a 15-year jail term for drug smuggling. Last month, a Chinese court sentenced another Canadian, Fan Wei, to death for participating in a global methamphetamine operation.

Meng's Charter of Rights defence

The resolution landed as Meng's defence team said it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the U.S. because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest at Vancouver's airport was unlawful.

Benjamin Howes, a spokesman for Huawei Canada, told reporters in Vancouver Wednesday that Meng's legal team will also argue that her rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated during her arrest.

""Ms. Meng intends to apply to the court for a stay of the extradition proceedings. Canadians value the rule of law and the Charter of Rights,"" he said.

""We have trust in the Canadian legal process and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored.""

According to the federal government's guide to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ""any person in Canada – whether they are a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident or a newcomer – has the rights and freedoms contained in the Charter.""

Seeking more documents

During a hearing Wednesday, Crown prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley, who is representing the Attorney General of Canada, asked Justice Heather Holmes to see that Meng's case proceeds as quickly as possible, proposing a first court date by the end of August.

He said the allegations against Meng centre on a misrepresentation she is alleged to have made to a bank that put the institution's economic interests at risk, adding it's not yet time to make arguments in the case.

The defence said it needs more time to gather documents through freedom of information requests. It also wants audio from Meng's questioning at the time of her arrest, which already has been described as unlawful in a civil suit."

If it does, then these companies become agents of the State, doing its business for it, and therefore they should be subject to obligations to respect freedom of expression and due process.",13.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

The Chinese tech executive at the centre of a high-profile international extradition case is seeking to have her case thrown out.

Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer for Chinese telecom giant Huawei, told the the B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver Wednesday that she is the subject of an abuse of process by border officials, RCMP, the FBI and the government of Canada.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.

WATCH: Huawei Canada spokesperson details problems with case

She stands accused of violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran by allegedly misrepresenting Huawei’s ownership and control of Skycom, a company doing business in the Middle Eastern country.

Speaking outside the court, Huawei Canada’s vice-president of media affairs Benjamin Howes said the application to toss the case was based on three key arguments.

Howes said Meng had not actually broken sanctions against Iran, as alleged by U.S. authorities, and had been clear and above board about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom.

He further argued that Meng had been the subject of “serious and repeated violations” of her charter rights at the direction of the FBI and at the hands of Canadian authorities.

“The RCMP intentionally delayed the presentation of the arrest warrant in order to carry out the unlawful detention and search against Ms. Meng,” Howes said.

“This was done under the pretense of a routine border check.”

Meng’s legal team will further argue the sanctions on financial services she is accused of violating are not imposed in Canada, meaning the case does not meet the “double criminality” requirement of Canada’s extradition agreement with the U.S., and is therefore not lawful, Howes said.

In court, Meng’s lawyer Scott Fenton also argued that comments by U.S. President Donald Trump prove the case is politically motivated.

The U.S. and China have tried to keep Meng’s case separate from their trade dispute, although Trump has said he would consider intervening in the case if it would help forge a trade deal with Beijing.

Fenton called Trump’s comments “intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law.”

Wednesday’s court appearance also saw Meng granted the right to move to a home she owns in Vancouver’s posh Shaughnessy neighbourhood.

The 46-year-old has been living at another of her two multimillion-dollar Vancouver homes on a $10-million bail. She is also under 24-hour surveillance by a private security company as well as electronic monitoring.

WATCH (March 4, 2019): Does Meng have a strong case against U.S. extradition?

The Canadian government has refused to intervene in the case, citing the rule of law.

While Meng fights her extradition, she has also launched a lawsuit against the federal government, the Canada Border Services Agency and RCMP.

Meng claims Canada violated her constitutional rights when officers detained and questioned her for three hours at Vancouver International Airport before notifying her of her arrest.

The United States is now putting pressure on its British ally to stop the Chinese telecom from establishing a 5G network in the U.K.

Speaking in London, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo invoked the politics of Margaret Thatcher.

“”Ask yourself this: Would the Iron Lady be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption and coercion?,” he said.

“Would she allow China to control the internet of the future?”

Careful not to anger China, the British government would only say that there is no final decision on the matter.

Canada is already facing Beijing’s wrath.

Since Meng’s arrest, two Canadians — ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor — have been detained in China in apparent retaliation.

Trade issues have also become strained with China blocking imports of Canadian pork and canola.

CBC News has learned the federal government is set to announce at a news conference Wednesday morning a boost to the maximum amount available to individual farmers under the Advance Payments Program (APP), from $400,000 per year to $1 million.

The news comes not long after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised that help for canola farmers would be ""coming out in a few days.""

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr will announce details at a news conference on Parliament Hill at 9:30 a.m. ET and CBCNews.ca will carry it live.

Under the former APP rules, producers could receive up to $400,000 per year in advances based on the value of their crops or livestock, with the federal government paying the interest on the first $100,000.

Producers repay the advances after they sell their product. Cash advanced for most commodities has to be repaid in 18 months; cattle and bison producers get 24 months to pay.

Ottawa is changing the APP rules in response to market turmoil in the canola sector. China has blocked Canadian canola seed from Richardson International and Viterra, two of Canada's biggest exporters, saying that shipments were contaminated with pests.

Other China-bound shipments of Canadian canola have been cancelled, forcing exporters to sell the seed elsewhere at a discount. And Reuters reports more commodities are hitting inspection roadblocks at Chinese ports, leaving exporters to scramble for alternate markets.

Canadian politicians have insisted there is no basis for China's pest claim. China's move is widely seen as an act of retaliation over Canada's decision to arrest Meng Wanzhou, an executive with the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, for extradition to the United States.

""Canadians know, of course, as do people around the world, that Canadian food inspection and the quality of Canadian agriculture and produce is world-class, and the processes we have cannot be beaten anywhere in the world,"" Trudeau told a media event Monday morning.

While the move is being driven by the plight of canola growers, the revised APP program is available to all farmers. For canola farmers, however, the federal government is increasing the interest-free portion of the cash advances to $500,000.

Prime Minister Trudeau is expected to call premiers tonight to fill them in on the new APP rules.

Meanwhile, the Trudeau government is trying to go to the source to end China's trade action. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau recently sent a formal request to Beijing for permission to send Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials to China to personally inspect Canadian canola shipments for pests.

Sources tell CBC News that while Chinese officials have been talking positively about the trade relationship with Canada and their desire to solve the canola spat, they've yet to give the CFIA permission to send its own inspectors to China. The sources said the federal government isn't viewing China's stance as an outright rejection of its proposal and plans to keep pushing the idea with Beijing.

Meanwhile, Ottawa continues to search for new markets for Canadian canola. International Trade Minister Jim Carr is expected to lead a trade mission to locate buyers beyond the Chinese market but the government isn't sharing details at this point."

When cons slash revenue streams and end breaking the bank they don't care.",2.0,43.0,"The Ford government is reducing funding for children and youth at risk by $84.5 million, according to an analysis of provincial spending estimates by the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies.

The reduction includes a $28 million cut to the $1.5 billion the province gives 49 children’s aid societies in Ontario, increasing concerns about the ability of agencies to serve and protect vulnerable children. The cut comes as 18 child protection agencies struggle with deficits totalling more than $12 million.

The deficits have already forced some agencies to lay off staff and reduce the number of children at risk they take into care.

“A decrease in children in care does not mean there are fewer children in need of protection,” the OACAS warned in a PowerPoint produced in late March, outlining its core messages before the provincial budget was tabled.

The association’s post-budget analysis suggests their warning may not have been heard.

The $84.5 million cut for youth at risk is contained in a May 16 “briefing note” the OACAS sent to top CAS officials, and obtained by the Star. The calculations are based on the government’s operating and capital spending estimates tabled in the legislature May 9.

The OACAS calculated funding envelopes that fall under the budget line of “child and youth at risk,” including services for child protection and youth involved with the justice system.

The association is uncertain about the full impact of the cuts. Some funding envelopes have been eliminated and new ones created. It’s unclear if programs funded under the eliminated envelopes will continue to be funded under the new ones. Some of the cuts may involve the closing of unused facilities or resources, particularly in the area of youth justice. But when all the pluses and minuses are calculated, the funding shortfall is $84.5 million, according to the OACAS.

“We are concerned about the impact of any potential cuts to our members and to the families that they serve,” Nicole Bonnie, chief executive officer of the OACAS said in an email response to questions.

“At this time we do not have details as to which programs will be funded or who will deliver them,” Bonnie added. “We are waiting for more detailed information from the ministry to understand the exact nature of the impact on child welfare.”

Bonnie hopes to soon meet with Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. “Our message is and always has been that the children and families we serve are the most marginalized and disenfranchised, and programs that support their well-being need to be fully funded.”

The minister’s office did not respond to direct questions about the cuts. In an emailed statement, MacLeod’s press secretary, Derek Rowland, described the well-being of vulnerable young people as the government’s “utmost priority.” The steady decline of children being taken into care since 2006, he added, has helped most children’s aid societies balance their budgets and the ministry is working with those that haven’t.

“We will be holding Ontario’s Children’s Aid Societies and other providers to higher standards to keep our kids safe,” Rowland said, denouncing what he described as “the lack of oversight and relaxed regulation” of the previous Liberal government.

Rowland said the government is increasing investments in prevention programs “to ensure kids keep out of trouble.” The government also “expects significant savings” in the youth justice sector after a review found “underutilized detention facilities.”

A plan to reduce the number of children’s aid societies through amalgamation is also being considered by the ministry.

What isn’t in doubt is that children’s aid societies will have less core funding to work with.

One children’s aid society, Brant Family and Children’s Services, has struggled with deficits that forced the layoff of 26 workers in March, in a community facing perhaps the worst opioid addiction epidemic in the province. Its executive director then posted a letter to the Brantford area community on the agency’s website, warning of serious consequences.

“When governments cut child welfare services (managers, front-line staff, and support services), children ultimately die or are allowed by society to live in unbearable, violent and neglectful conditions,” Andy Koster wrote.

“With higher caseloads and tight timelines, workers are forced to move from one crisis to another instead of planning and working proactively with families to prevent future incidents,” he added. “Despite best efforts, children fall through the cracks and suffer the consequences of insufficient resources.”

The cuts for children at risk also comes on the heels of the government eliminating the office that advocated for children and youth.

Kiaras Gharabaghi, director of Ryerson University’s School of Child and Youth Care, denounced the cuts as implemented without consultations.

“They are cuts that have no interest in making the system work better for kids and families,” he said in an interview after reviewing the OACAS document.

“This sector requires a different approach,” Gharabaghi added. “It’s one where young people die by violence, by suicide, by neglect. It’s not the same as increasing class sizes in schools to save some money.”

If you were in academia you’d understand the difference.",0.0,14.0,"A concentrated solar thermal (CST) plant seemed like a good idea at one time — circa 2009 — but this week, the city of Medicine Hat pointed its solar panels down, shuttering the facility after five years of operation.

Collin Gallant, a reporter at the Medicine Hat News, said Wednesday in an interview with the Calgary Eyeopener that the plant wasn't a bad idea gone wrong, but rather a victim of persistently low natural gas prices.

""Back when this was thought up as an energy savings program, natural gas was about seven times more expensive than it is today,"" Gallant said.

The plant cost approximately $12 million, with half of that coming from the City of Medicine Hat, and $3 million from both the province and federal government.

Back in 2014, when it opened, Medicine Hat Mayor Ted Clugston was bullish on solar thermal energy.

Medicine Hat now operates a solar thermal power plant. It's the first of its kind in Canada. 1:57

""The idea behind this project is helping to save gas — some day we will run out of it,"" Clugston said.

Even back then, Clugston acknowledged that the plant made no financial sense because it produced only one megawatt of electricity on an ideal summer day, and the city was not as flush with cash in 2014 when it opened as in 2009 when it launched the project.

Technology common in southern U.S.

The technology that the plant utilized is commonly used in the southern United States. According to Gallant, Medicine Hat's city council tapped into a federal innovation fund in 2008 with a pitch to locate a solar thermal power plant in one of Canada's sunniest cities (2,544 sunshine hours and 330 sunny days a year, according to the City of Medicine Hat website).

As the northernmost CST plant, Medicine Hat's facility provided Alberta Innovates with a significant sample size of data — the deal was that it would provide five years' worth — said Cal Lenz, Medicine Hat's commissioner of energy and utilities, in a release.

""Medicine Hat took a bold step with the project, coming up with the idea at a time when gas prices were extremely high,"" said Lenz. ""Innovation takes valiant moves, and this project is certainly an example of the city's leadership as we continually explore energy solutions.""

The city didn't announce any plans for the plant, other than to say that council would be presented with options in the fall.

Gallant said the plan might be to keep it shut down but intact, in case gas prices escalate, thus making CST-generated energy economical again.

Mothballs

""It's been built, it works, but the decision right now in Medicine Hat is just to mothball it until natural gas prices go up again,"" Gallant said.

The challenge is that natural gas prices have remained stubbornly low and there's no timetable that sees them rising to a level that would make operating the plant economically feasible in the near term, he added.

""I think they said that at the size it is now it would take gas costs of about $19 or … $20 a gigajoule to to make it economical again,"" Gallant said.

Maintaining the plant without running it presents challenges, as well.

""There's some costs in keeping it clean,"" he said. ""There are very large mirrors involved. There's maintenance — it is a pressure system and extreme pressure system so it has to be recertified every now and then.

""The idea is that they're going to mothball it, although I've heard tell they're looking for options for it — there's private industry that might need heat, [and] it does produce a lot of heat.""

The project, Gallant added, is one of a number of sustainability-oriented projects initiated by Medicine Hat.

""The City of Medicine Hat has a fairly forward thinking about renewable energy. We've had a solar home subsidy grant here for about 10 years,"" he said, also noting wind purchase contracts, home turbines and other renewable projects.

""We're 'The Gas City,' but that allowed us to do some interesting things here.""

While the project cost Medicine Hat more than the original plan (which was targeted at $9-10 million), and was already uneconomical by the time it opened in 2014, Lenz said it's no sustainability flop.

""Innovation may not always lead to commercialization, but it does provide valuable information for further endeavours. These learnings will help advance the next evolution of cost-effective, energy-saving initiatives,"" said Lenz in a news release.

""The provincial and federal governments chose our city to lead the project and foster learning about this technology, and this objective has been successfully achieved.""

It also doesn't help that existing and new conservative provincial governments are doing things that make the situation worse, or flat out attempt to sabotage the federal government in various ways just to ""stick it"" to the JT and libs, since it's an election year and all. 

For example, infrastructure in Ontario: 

https://ipolitics.ca/2019/03/21/trudeau-blames-recalcitrant-ontario-for-delayed-infrastructure-cash/

&gt;Until this month, infrastructure issues, which are typically easier for different governments to co-operate on, had not been among the flash points between the two governments.

&gt;Ford’s government is dismissing the criticism from Trudeau as an attempt to shirk responsibility ahead of the fall federal election.

&gt;“It’s convenient after four years of Liberals being in power, on the eve of an election, that it is provincial governments impeding the development of infrastructure. Not their own government and their own department making that a political priority,” Stephen Lecce, the parliamentary assistant to the provincial infrastructure minister, said Thursday.

&gt;He disputed the federal government’s figure that before Ford took office more than 2,000 projects were approved in Ontario. “Not many are shovel in the ground,” he argued.

&gt;“Justin Trudeau has had four years to get infrastructure projects done, and the fact that he can’t point to many examples of success in that respect speaks to his own record,” Lecce said.

&gt;**But information pointed to by the federal government shows that construction for the majority of products approved by the Liberals has already started.

&gt;Detailed statistics provided by the province later in the day show that 1,799 projects, or 89 per cent of them, are already underway.**

Hard to imagine conservative darling Doug Ford would lie about this! Oh wait.",3.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

At what point is the airline not responsible for mother nature's wrath?",1.0,104.0,"The federal government is rolling out its air passenger protection regulations on the eve of the summer travel season setting out what compensation airlines must pay for failing to provide adequate services to passengers.

The new regulations announced Friday will be launched in two phases. Some regulations come into force on July 15, while others will not take effect until December 15.

""Our goal was to provide a world-leading approach to air passenger rights that would be predictable and fair for passengers while ensuring our air carriers remain strong and competitive,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement.

""After a long and thorough consultation process, I am proud to say these new regulations achieve that balance and will give air travellers the rights and treatment they pay for and deserve,"" he added.

The regulations will apply to all flights to, from and within Canada, including connecting flights. Large airlines, those that have serviced two million passengers or more in the last two years, will have a slightly different regulatory regime than smaller airlines in some cases.

Smaller airlines, for example, will have to pay less compensation for delays or cancellations that are within the airline's control but are not related to safety issues.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau announces new regulations and penalties for airlines related to air travel delays. 1:50

Broadly, flight disruptions — tarmac delays, flight cancellations, and denials of boarding — that are within an airline's control require compensation be paid, standards of treatment be upheld and the passenger's itinerary be completed.

Flight disruptions within an airline's control but required for safety reasons will not require compensation but airlines will have to maintain a standard of treatment and complete a passenger's itinerary.

Situations outside an airline's control that cause a flight disruption will only require the airline to ensure the passenger's itinerary is completed.

Situations within an airline's control include overbooking and scheduled maintenance.

Delays within an airline's control due to safety include mechanical problems and safety calls made by the pilot.

Disruptions outside an airline's control include a wide range of possibilities such as political instability, weather, natural disasters and security threats.

Rules in place by July 15

The first set of rules lays out the regulations and compensation regime related to delays on the tarmac, what happens when a passenger is denied boarding, lost and damaged luggage and the transportation of musical instruments.

The standards of treatment during a delay on the tarmac that must be in force by July 15 include ensuring that all passengers have access to working toilets.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau speaks during a news conference in Ottawa last month. Garneau said new rules announced Friday for airlines came after extensive consultation with passengers and the industry. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

An airline will also have to ensure the aircraft is properly ventilated and kept either cool or warm depending on the time of year. Passengers will also have to be provided food and drink and the ability to communicate with people outside of the plane free of charge, if possible.

Planes that have been on the tarmac for three hours will be required to return to the gate so people can get off. The only exception is when a departure is likely within the first 45 minutes after the three-hour time. In that case, the plane can remain where it is.

Overbooking

Starting July 15, passengers who are prevented from boarding an aircraft because of overbooking will be compensated financially depending on the length of time they are delayed from reaching their final destination.

Overbooking delays of less than six hours will require a minimum $900 payment, delays between six and nine hours mean a minimum $1,800 payment and delays longer than nine hours will see passengers compensated a minimum of $2,400.

When it comes to lost or damaged baggage, an airline will be liable for $2,100 for the lost bag and will also have to refund any baggage fees paid for the lost bag.

Airlines are also going to have to include terms and conditions for the transportation of musical instruments whether they are taken as a carry on or are checked into the cargo hold.

Phase two

The rules and compensation for cancelled flights and delays are part of phase two of the rollout.

As of December 15, airlines will have to provide compensation to passengers for delayed or cancelled flights depending on the size of the airline.

Delayed arrival at a final destination of between three to six hours will cost large airlines $400 and small airlines $125. Delays of between six to nine hour will cost large airlines $700 and small airlines $250. Delays greater than nine hours will cost large airlines $1,000 and smaller airlines half that amount.

The regulations do not only require an airline ensure the passenger gets to their final destination, but that they do so in the same class of service.

If an airline cannot rebook a passenger on their own airline and the delay is longer than nine hours, the airline has to book the passenger on a competing airline. If the passenger decides the delay has rendered the trip useless they will get a refund and the required financial compensation.

By mid December, airlines will also have to ensure that children under the age of five are seated next to their parent or guardian, children aged five to 11 are in the same row and no more than one seat away from their parent or guardian and children aged 12 or 13 are no more than one row away.

Airlines that don't adhere to the new standards can be fined up to $25,000 per incident by the Canadian Transport Agency.

""Thousands of Canadians participated in the consultations that helped shape these new rules,"" Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency, said in a statement.

""We're grateful for their input, and confident that these groundbreaking regulations will help ensure passengers are treated fairly if their air travel doesn't go smoothly,"""

At least that's what his lawyer says. But this raises the question of how one distinguishes a child doll from an adult one.",6.0,84.0,"A St. John's man accused of possessing child pornography in an unusual case involving what's been described as a child sex doll has been found not guilty.

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-defence-committee-1.5138975,Ok there Sealion.,1.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-defence-committee-1.5138975,Ok sealion,1.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

On Friday, police executed a search warrant at a home on Larratt Lane, near Bathurst Street and Elgin Mills Road West, and discovered explosive materials. Police did not specify what exactly the materials were or how much was removed. They said chemicals were also seized.

Ontario Provincial Police, along with the York police's explosives detection unit, helped to removed the materials.

As a precaution, police practically shut down the street on Friday, forcing neighbours from their homes and restricting vehicle and pedestrian traffic as officers carried out their work. Neighbours have since been allowed back into their homes, police said.

Despite, evacuation orders being lifted and the suburban street returning to normal, residents say they have been left feeling uneasy.

I am sure some nuclear owners are trying to sway the opinions of people by pushing agendas.,-2.0,44.0,"Canada has been at the forefront of nuclear energy for almost 80 years. Canadian uranium and Canadian researchers were central to the U.S. development of nuclear weapons in the Second World War.

The first test reactor was built at Chalk River, Ont., giving this country a head start in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes after the war. Ottawa created a Crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and we soon emerged as a leading nuclear nation, building Candu reactors for electricity in this country, and selling Candu technology to several countries around the world.

The province of Ontario became one of the most nuclearized jurisdictions in the world. Three major nuclear plants were built at Pickering and Darlington on Lake Ontario, and the biggest one in Bruce County on Lake Huron. Today, nuclear power accounts for 60 per cent of the electricity in the province.

From day one, there has been a current of opposition to nuclear power, and like an electrical surge, criticism has spiked at times – during cost overruns in the province, and in the aftermath of disasters abroad. The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania occurred just as a federal election campaign was getting underway in Canada in the spring of 1979.

Then-leader of the New Democratic Party Ed Broadbent called for a moratorium on expanding nuclear power in Canada. The opposition leader, Joe Clark, said he would have a committee of Parliament look into all aspects of nuclear power.

The immediate danger from Three Mile Island would pass and so did the political debate. Much the same happened after Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The disasters were horrific and chilling, but the loud debate over nuclear energy eventually receded.

Decades into the nuclear era the world has suffered periodic nuclear catastrophes, but it has also been left with a legacy of relatively safe use of nuclear energy.

In fact, the fear that may have existed near nuclear plants when they were first built, has largely been replaced by confidence in the safety of nuclear technology.

“It’s been here for 50 years, and it’s a part of life,” the mayor of Kincardine, Ont., Anne Eadie, told Global News.

Kincardine sits next to the Bruce Power facility. About one-third of the plant’s 4,200 workers live in Kincardine.

“We are quite, quite comfortable. I would think there is more risk going on our roads to work than actually working at a nuclear power plant,” said Eadie. Tweet This

While the nuclear creating heat and electricity has been well contained in reactors, ceramic pellets and fuel bundles, we have been left with big a problem that everyone saw coming: the hazard posed by nuclear waste.

At the Bruce plant, low and intermediate level wastes are accumulating. Low-level includes worker clothing and tools. Typically, they could be radioactive for 100 years. Intermediate-level waste is described as resins, filters and used reactor components that could be a hazard for 100,000 years.

Ontario Power Generation has slowly made headway for a plan to bury this waste in a deep underground repository next to the Bruce plant. Much of it now sits in large tanks with row upon row of cement lids poking above the surface.of the ground.

Fred Kuntz, wearing an OPG hard hat, gazed over the containers: “This is all safe storage for now, but it’s not really the solution for thousands of years. The lasting solution is disposal in a deep geologic repository.”

He pointed to a stand of trees. “The DGR would be built here.”

Some think that’s a terrible idea. The repository could leak, it could be attacked, and the location on the Bruce site is barely a kilometer from Lake Huron, which has opponents on both sides of the Great Lakes up in arms.

“There isn’t a magic bullet. It’s not like we can put it out of sight and we’ve solved the problem.” said Theresa McClenaghan of the Canadian Environamental Law Association.

She suggests humans have little concept of how long 100,000 years is. She questions whether the facility would last and whether we can be sure we’ll be able to communicate the dangers to some future civilization.

OPG says the proximity to Lake Huron is much more distant when you plunge the waste into rock more than half a kilometer below the surface. That’s more than three times deeper than the depth of the lake in sedimentary rock that is 450 million years old.

The proposed deep geological repository for nuclear waste will be 680 metres below the surface more than three times deeper than the depth of Lake Huron. Global News

Fred Kuntz of OPG said, “The rock at 680 metres deep is impermeable. It’s dry. It’s strong. The geology at that depth below the site has been isolated from any groundwater or the lake for hundreds of millions of years.”

The deep geological repository was approved by an environmental review panel in 2015, but both the Harper and Trudeau governments have put off giving the final go ahead. It now appears to hinge on the approval by indigenous people in the region.

For the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, it’s about time they were consulted. Fifty years ago, the concerns of indigenous people were an afterthought when it came to major public policy decisions.

The nuclear plant was built on the traditional land of the Saugeen Ojibway. OPG says it has come to recognize the “historic wrongs of the past” and is negotiating compensation for those wrongs. And moving forward, OPG has given its assurance that the repository will only be built if the Saugeen Ojibway approve – from an afterthought to the power of veto over a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

If approved, the proposed deep geologic repository to store used nuclear fuel will be on the territory of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in southwestern Ontario. Nick Vyfschaft / Global News

Randall Kahgee, a former chief and now advisor on nuclear issues to the Saugeen Ojibway, says the original decisions to build a nuclear plant on their land was made with “little to no consultation with [their] people,” but now comes the weighty decision about what to do with the nuclear waste.

“It’s here,” he said. “We didn’t ask for it. It’s not a problem of our own creation. Certainly had we been part of the conversation from the outset, things probably would have been a lot different.” Tweet This

There is a kind of irony for the Saugeen Ojibway in dealing with nuclear waste. Among Canadians, First Nations have always emphasized the need to care for the land and the water. They have taken the long view of their responsibility to future generations, but here they are confronted with something beyond even their historic comprehension of obligation.

Kahgee says the elders have traditionally looked seven generations ahead. Nuclear waste requires wisdom that extends a thousand generations.

Kahgee says it is a heavy decision and in some ways unfair.

“Our people don’t see it as a simple project. We see that as a forever project, because that’s how long it will be here. And if it’s allowed to proceed, it will forever become part of the cosmology of our people, so how can we not be part of that conversation?”

Kahgee says it is empowering, but also “very scary when you consider the gravity of what you’re dealing with.”

Bottom line, nuclear waste exists, and it exists on their land.

“We think about stewardship,” Kahgee told Global News.

“Implicit in stewardship is the responsibility to act. I hope we’re prepared for the next conversation, which is, ‘What are we going to do about the problem?’ because it’s not going away.” Tweet This

Remarkably, this is the relatively easy stuff to deal with: low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste. An even bigger problem is high-level radioactive used fuel. It too is piling up, primarily at the three big Ontario plants. It may be toxic for a million years.

Now what’s to be done? Enter the Nuclear Waste Management Organization. It was established in 2002 under Ottawa’s Nuclear Fuel Waste Act by Canada’s nuclear electricity producers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

The NWMO is tasked with coming up with a long overdue plan for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. In 2005 the NWMO recommended and in 2007 Ottawa accepted a proposal to contain all of the country’s used fuel in one deep geological repository.

If you’re keeping count, that would be a second DGR in Ontario. The estimated cost of this project is $23 billion. One NWMO executive described it as the biggest infrastructure project you’ve never heard of.

READ MORE: Atlantic Canada clean energy collaboration receives $2M federal investment

The organization wants the public to learn more about it. It seems that the first response to nuclear waste is public resistance, so the more they can talk about it, the better the chance of persuading Canadians of its merits.

Ultimately they need to find one particular community to be a “willing host” for what amounts to 57,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel.

To put that in Canadian jargon, the NWMO says the roughly three million used fuel bundles would fit into eight hockey rinks up to the top of the boards. Doubtless, most communities would take the hockey rinks over the bundles.

NWMO does not lack for communities willing to consider taking the waste; more than 20 expressed interest. That number has been trimmed to five potential sites: Ignace, Manitouwadge, and Hornepayne in northern Ontario, and Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce in southwestern Ontario.

The NWMO pitch paints a picture of a repository that will be safe, essentially forever. The construction and transportation will ensure one small community decades of economic growth.

The waste management organization is convinced it has the engineering figured out. The small ceramic nuclear pellets that fit into tubes are collected into those familiar nuclear bundles – each about the size of a fire log and a lot hotter in terms of radiation.

The plan is to pack the bundles into carbon steel tubes coated in copper – 48 bundles per container. They look like a big torpedoes. Each one will be packed snugly into what look like coffins made of a special clay called bentonite.

Thousands of bentonite boxes will be moved by robotic machines into hundreds of long placement rooms deep underground. Dried slightly, the clay will expand and plug every last space, ultimately sealing the repository. Multiple barriers to contain the waste in rock so old that it would take millions of years for water or radioactivity to make its way out – that, in a nutshell, is the science.

One of NWMO’s technical experts, Erik Kremer, says it will work in either the Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior, which is billion-year-old granite, or the 300-million-year-old sedimentary limestone in western Ontario.

Either way, he said the rock has been stable for much longer than the time needed for the radioactivity to subside.

“I mean if it’s billion-year-old rock, it’s not much to ask for another million years,” Kremer said. Tweet This

And, he added, the containers are designed to withstand the crushing weight that could come from a future earthquake or even glaciers in the next ice age.

“This needs to be able to withstand those forces,” he said.

If you think environmentalists are skeptical of the low and medium waste repository, just listen to their take on burying this stuff.

“I mean, it sounds crazy to be talking about that. We’re talking about waste that’s going to be toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.” said the Canadian Environmental Law Association’s Theresa McClenaghan.

Rather than lock in a decision now, she suggests fortifying the temporary storage for a few more decades and waiting for new and better technologies to come along.

Coincidentally, Gerard Mourou, the Nobel-Prize-winning physicist is turning his expertise in lasers toward zapping the radioactivity out of nuclear waste.

Maybe it’s far-fetched and years away, but McClenaghan said there are no good solutions on the table right now, so “let’s choose the least bad alternative.”

Brennain Lloyd with a nuclear watchdog group, Northwatch, agrees, suggesting a deep repository will leave future generations few options for new ideas.

“What we should not do is foreclose on future generations’ opportunity to do better,” she told Global News.

The NWMO says it’s time to act. Ben Belfadhel, the organization’s vice-president in charge of site selection, says there’s no guarantee that there will be a better solution 200 or 300 years from now.

“Doing nothing is not an option,” he said. Tweet This

“The waste is there, and we have to do something to protect future generations. We are the generation that is benefitting from nuclear, and we owe it to future generations to provide them with the solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel,” said Belfadhel.

He says the plan also leaves scope for technologies to change, so there will be opportunities for their plans and this project to adapt.

Still, he is seized by the enormity of the decisions his organization must make.

“When you look at what we are doing and protecting future generations, I think for me it’s a noble project,” said Belfadhel.

It still comes down to finding a willing host. The NWMO wants to pick the site by 2023. The five communities on the NWMO’s short list are all relatively small and rural, sit above a suitable rock formation, and they have all demonstrated an openness to the project so far.

Each has a liaison committee working with the NWMO to hold regular meetings where residents can raise questions and learn more about the project, but what a decision for one small town to make.

Mildmay, Ont. is a small farming town in South Bruce. It’s not home to the Bruce Power plant, but it’s close enough that people here are familiar and comfortable with nuclear as a neighbor.

Jim Gowland is a local farmer and chaired the most recent liaison committee meeting.

“Certainly our community has seen the benefits of Bruce Power and the nuclear industry. We know the used fuel is sitting up there in interim storage, and there has to be a solution. And I think our community can be a part of evaluating that solution,” he said.

The NWMO sent a representative to that same meeting to reassure townsfolk on the issue of transporting nuclear fuel. Caitlin Burley brought a prop with her – a metal bolt that looks like a 10-pound barbell.

She explained that 32 such bolts are used just to keep the lid on one of the containers that would be used to transport the used fuel – 35-tonne containers, each carrying four tonnes of fuel.

She also played a video that showed containers being tested – a train in the UK ramming a nuclear container in a 1984 test, and a German test in 1999 in which a propane tank car exploded. The nuclear containers survived intact.

Most people watching seemed satisfied. One attendee, Ron Schnurr, said afterward, “The thing is we have to trust somebody, and we do hope these professional people know what they’re talking about.”

Dennis Eikeimer was not convinced: “It’s so tremendously dangerous the nuclear waste.”

He has a background in physics, and he’s not sold on long-term storage underground.

“And if it does leak, there is absolutely nothing they can do,” he said. Tweet This

Instead he suggested to “just store it and do some more research.”

It’s hard to ignore the used fuel as it accumulates above ground. Bruce Power has more than 1.2 million nuclear bundles of used fuel. A little more than half of it is in wet storage – in big pools of water where the radioactivity can “cool down” for seven to 10 years.

Story continues below advertisement

The rest is older fuel, already moved into dry storage in massive concrete and steel containers on site. New containers are brought in regularly, tested, and then filled with 384 used fuel bundles.

The massive containers – 1,539 of them – are put in a giant hangar, warm enough to the touch that there is no need to heat the building.

Picking a host community, getting regulatory approval, building the repository, and transferring high-level waste will take the next 50 years.

It is separate from the OPG plan for low- and intermediate-level waste, which could have an answer from the Saugeen Ojibway Nation by the end of this year, and federal approval in 2020.

As it turns out, two of the NWMO sites for high-level waste – South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss – are also on Saugeen Ojibway land, so they may ultimately have to decide on separate nuclear waste projects on their land.

Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

It's evidence based practice (the most consistent &amp; factual way of doing things we have); there is more evidence to say it that way, that's why we should speak of it that way.  If there is that evidence for biking, skateboarding or martial arts, then let that evidence speak for itself, but as far as I see and you show they don't.  

Otherwise, we are just speaking totally from our asses, biases and prejudices and that is where inconsistency really comes from.  People are  inconsistent, numbers and stats are static.",2.0,58.0,"Players, parents and coaches are angry that the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation has decided to cancel public school rugby games across the province because of safety concerns.

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

Claire Avery, a rugby player at Charles P. Allen High School, said she and her teammates were shocked and devastated by the news.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Brooklyn Peyton, who plays rugby for Lockview High School in Fall River, hoped she would go to university on a rugby scholarship.

She said she's blown away by news of the cancellation.

'I just love the team'

""I started with this team, it's important to me, they are like family,"" she said. ""My coach means a lot to me. He's kind of like my second dad ... I just love the team.""

She and other rugby players at Lockview plan to wear their jerseys to school Friday and play some informal games on the school field to show support for the team.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the group has asked to meet with the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation about the decision to cancel school rugby. (CBC)

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

It's absolute bedlam over here, fire and brimstone and all that. Ignore all the out-of-province license plates at Costco, those sinners know not what they have unleashed upon the virgin province of Ontario.",12.0,70.0,"Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

Once the battery cost drops (which it has been doing) then it will be cheaper to buy an EV vs an ICE vehicle. No subsidy will change that.",5.0,51.0,"The cars pass almost silently, but you see hundreds of them on the streets. Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Slim selection

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

End this partisan hackery.,16.0,57.0,"The federal government has named the eight Canadian organizations that will sit on a special advisory panel tasked with recommending news operations for participation in a $600 million media support fund.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced in his fall economic update that the federal government would make $600 million in tax credits and incentives available to selected media outlets over the next five years.

An independent panel of experts was to be tasked with naming the eligible news organizations and assisting the government in implementing the measures.

""Today, we are reaching another milestone toward the implementation of these tax measures that aim to support Canadian journalism and journalism in under-served communities,"" said Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez.

The eight associations that have been asked to select a representative to sit on the independent panel by the middle of June are: News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

According to a statement released by Rodriguez's office, the panel members will be expected to consult with third parties and industry stakeholders before reporting back to the minister's office by late July.

In his fall update, Morneau announced some details of the $600 million program to help Canada's news media organizations — many of which have been struggling with diminishing revenue and falling readership numbers.

Under the program, news media organizations are eligible for refundable tax credits, a non-refundable tax credit for subscriptions to Canadian digital news and access to charitable tax incentives for not-for-profit journalism.

Rodriguez also named the seven organizations representing different segments of the news media which will be responsible for administering an additional fund of $50 million over five years to help regional media outlets.

The seven local organizations are: News Media Canada, Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspapers Association, National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, Community Radio Fund of Canada, the Canadian Association of Community Television Users and Stations, and the Fédération des télévisions communautaires autonomes du Québec."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/christian-woman-pakistan-arrives-canada-asia-bibi-1.5127495,I agree. Silly rules invented by con men have no place in a civilized country,21.0,165.0,"A lawyer representing a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after she spent eight years on death row in Pakistan says she has arrived in Canada.

Pakistani officials and others involved in the case said Wednesday that Asia Bibi had left Pakistan to be reunited with her daughters in Canada, where they had been granted asylum. Her lawyer, Saif-ul Malook, said she had already arrived in Canada.

Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2009 after a quarrel with a fellow farmworker. Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction last year and she had been in protective custody since then.

Islamic extremists have rioted over the case and threatened to kill her. The same radical Islamists, many of whom have been jailed for their threats, also urged the overthrow of the government following Bibi's acquittal.

Wilson Chawdhry of the British Pakistani Christian Association told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he received a text message from a British diplomat saying ""Asia is out."" A close friend of Bibi also confirmed that she had left the country, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

A statement from the association says it received confirmation around 8 p.m. ET Tuesday that Bibi ""had safely exited Pakistan.""

""Asia Bibi bravely held on to her faith through the most brutal of incarcerations that involved her having access to sunlight for two hours per month,"" the statement says. ""Now she finally travels to Canada to be reunited with her children.""

Chowdhry said in the statement released by the association that Bibi is ""unwell"" after suffering a decade of isolation both in and out of captivity.

""She must be treated with utmost care and receive appropriate medical care now she is free,"" he said.

Officials at Pakistan's interior and foreign ministries also confirmed her departure, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would not discuss the case Wednesday.

""I have no comment,"" Trudeau said. ""Obviously, there are sensitive privacy issues and security issues on this and unfortunately I can't comment at this time.""

Global Affairs Canada said Wednesday it ""has no comment on this matter."" Trudeau said last November that Canada was then in talks with the Pakistani government about Bibi.

The friend, who last spoke to her on Tuesday, said Bibi and her husband Ashiq Masih had spent the last several weeks getting their documents in order. He said she was longing to see her daughters, with whom she talked almost daily from her secure location, protected by Pakistani security forces.

Chawdhry said he had been in regular contact with Bibi's husband throughout the ordeal as well as with several diplomats involved in international efforts to get her to safety.

The case has brought international attention to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, which carries an automatic death penalty. The mere suspicion of blasphemy against Islam is enough to ignite mob lynchings in the country. The accusation of blasphemy has also been used to intimidate religious minorities and to settle scores.

Radical Islamists have made the punishment of blasphemy a major rallying cry, bringing tens of thousands into the streets and paralyzing major cities.

Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, has been celebrated as a martyr by hardliners since he was hanged for the killing, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Pakistan's minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated later that year after demanding justice for Bibi.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed not to be intimidated by the rioters, saying the rule of law would decide Bibi's fate. But she was denied permission to leave the country for several months until sentiments cooled.

A three-judge Supreme Court panel in January cleared Bibi's final legal hurdle when they ruled there was no compelling reason to overturn the court's earlier acquittal. The judges accused those who charged Bibi with blasphemy of committing perjury, but said they would not be tried because of the sensitivity of the case. The judges upheld the blasphemy law."

News fluff in general, archives are important and doing digs on them prevents stuff from falling into the black hole of time. 

Like archives Canada does some great work as well and contextualizes it. The CBC archives I don't believe are a part of that, but are archives of our short history nonetheless.",5.0,56.0,"Story transcript

Curling has been a staple of Canadian winters for decades, but there are some things that have changed over the years — like a skip sliding down the ice with a cigarette in his mouth.

Orest (The Big O) Meleschuk knows a little about smoking on the international stage, because he is the skip in a video that As It Happens recently dug up from the CBC Archives.

In it, a younger Meleschuk can be seen throwing an extremely important rock for Team Canada at the 1972 Silver Broom world championship in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria — complete with a lit dart in his mouth.

""Well you know, if it sits in an ashtray it's going to burn out and I was quite frugal in those days,"" Meleschuk told As It Happens host Carol Off from his home in Selkirk, Man.

""I didn't want to waste it.""

That throw by Meleschuk began one of the most contentious plays in curling history — known as the ""Great Kicked Rock Caper"".

The Canadian team needed two points to force another end against Team U.S.A., or the game was over and Canada would not hold their title for the fifth consecutive year.

As Meleschuk explains, he knocked the U.S. rock out but the Canadian's tying rock rolled farther than he had anticipated. Thinking they had won, the U.S. skip Bob LaBonte ran onto the ice, slipped and kicked the Canadian rock in premature celebration. ​

Canada ended up winning the match in an extra end.

'Beer out of a stein'

Meleschuk says he can't remember exactly how Team Canada celebrated their championship win, but since the match was held in Bavaria it was probably with a beer as opposed to their regular drink — whiskey straight.

""I drank my beer out of a stein, this way they didn't know whether it was milk or water or beer.""

Meleschuk remembered how popular smoking was back in the '70s and how much rinks have changed.

""A lot of curlers smoked. [There were] ashtrays on the boards and back of the ends. Ashtrays all over the place,"" he said.

But he admits that after watching video footage after the event of himself curling with a cigarette, he was a ""little bit embarrassed"" and decided to quit smoking.

""I quit after that year because I was watching a few films and I thought it was so disgusting that I thought I better quit,"" he said.

A broom a game

Meleschuk said he is impressed with how far the equipment has come in the last 40 years — most notably the brooms.

""In those days ... a broomer used to go through a broom almost every two games,"" he said.

""They really go through a broom in a game but we couldn't afford to buy that many brooms so you kept the broom as long as you could.""

That's because the brooms were made out of straw, as opposed to the squeegee-like brushes that are used now. The brooms would leave the sweepers with blisters all over their hands — something Meleschuk doesn't think curlers could handle now.

""I don't think any of the brushers now could flop that broom around from one end to the other for 12 ends, which we used to play,"" he said.

It also meant that there was straw all over the ice, something that could impede the rock if the house sweeper didn't do their job properly.

When it was pointed out to him that the cigarette ash on the ice may have also been a factor, Meleschuk laughed.

""That's why we used to have burnt rocks, because of the hot ashes."""

I know companies have put profits infront of safety before. But boeing isn't ford, when Ford cuts a corner people die here and there. When Boeing does it hundreds of people die at once and it gets everyone attention. Hence why they're being investigated by every agency in multiple countries right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I just seriously doubt they had a boardroom meeting where they were like yeah fuck it I need my bonus nobody will notice when planes start falling out of the sky....which is what this lawsuit is alleging.",13.0,58.0,"The families of Canadians killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash last month have launched a lawsuit against plane-maker Boeing.

Lawyers in Chicago and San Francisco have filed the suit on behalf of a Brampton, Ont., family who lost six members and a Hamilton-based man who lost his wife and three young children.

All 157 people aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were killed when the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft en route from Addis Ababa to Nairobi crashed on March 10.

Lawyers for the families behind the lawsuit allege Boeing was blinded by greed as it rushed its 737 Max 8 jets to market, claiming the company put profits over safety.

The families have also filed a claim against the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, alleging the regulator enabled the plane's rush to market.

The allegations have not been proven in court.

These are the latest among numerous lawsuits filed on behalf of dozens of crash victims.

News from the Canadian victims' families comes on the same day that Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg tried to bolster shareholder confidence in the company on Monday in his first general meeting since two fatal crashes of the 737 Max triggered the jet's grounding and subsequent investigations.

Battling the biggest crisis of his tenure, Muilenburg said the company was making steady progress toward getting approval for new software as questions linger over the safety of its fastest-selling airplane.

Family and friends of 24-year-old American Samya Stumo, another one of the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, held a silent protest outside the meeting site in a cold and rainy Chicago.

That crash, which killed all on board when it plunged to the ground shortly after takeoff, came five months after a similar Lion Air nose-dive that killed all 189 passengers and crew.

Daniel Johnson, a Boeing shareholder on and off since 1984, said it had been ""a great investment, better than anything else."" But Johnson, who is an engineer, said Boeing ""really stubbed their toe"" by allowing MCAS to rely on only one sensor, referring to the anti-stall system.

""The question is, will they need to rebrand. We don't know how much the general public actually knows what a 737 Max is,"" said Johnson outside the meeting.

Pressure for software fix

Boeing is under pressure to deliver a software fix to prevent erroneous data triggering the MCAS anti-stall system and a new pilot training package that will convince global regulators, and the flying public, that the aircraft is safe.

Boeing has acknowledged that the accidental firing of the software based on bad sensor data was a common link in the separate chains of events leading to the two accidents.

""We know we can break this link in the chain. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk,"" Muilenburg told shareholders.

About 150 shareholders gathered in the auditorium of the neoclassical Chicago Field Museum for the meeting.

During the meeting, one shareholder asked Muilenburg what Boeing was doing on safety assessments following the crashes. The CEO said the company's commitment to safety has not wavered.

""Safety is at the core of what we do. Every day, we try to get better,"" Muilenburg said.

Muilenburg held his first news conference since the grounding after the general annual shareholder meeting in Chicago on Monday, exactly six months after the Lion Air crash.

CEO faced motion to strip a title

Muilenburg is Boeing's chairman and president in addition to CEO, and faced calls to strip him of one of those titles at Monday's meeting, but a motion to split the chairman and CEO roles did not pass.

Asked at the news conference if he has considered resigning, Muilenburg cited his 34 years with the company and said, ""We know that lives depend on us.… I'm very focused on safety going forward. I am strongly vested in that, and my clear intent is to continue to lead on the front of safety and quality and integrity.""

The U.S. FAA could clear Boeing's 737 Max jet to fly in late May or the first part of June, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday, though Boeing has yet to submit the updated software and training for review.

Some pilots have warned that draft training proposals do not go far enough to address their concerns.

Meanwhile, deliveries of the 737 Max, which airlines around the world had been relying on to service a growing air travel industry for years to come, are on hold.

Last week, Boeing abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said lowered production due to the 737 Max grounding had cost it at least $1 billion US so far.

Shares lose nearly 10% of value

Shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing the company of defrauding them by concealing safety deficiencies in the plane. The model is also the target of investigations by U.S. transportation authorities and the Department of Justice.

Boeing must also contend with lawsuits filed on behalf of dozens of victims of the two crashes.

In addition to the new lawsuits filed Monday on behalf of Canadian families, the victim lawsuits also include one on behalf of the family of Stumo. They're asking whether the Ethiopian disaster could have been prevented after what happened to Lion Air.

""Those in charge of creating and selling this plane did not treat Samya as they would their own daughters,"" her mother, Nadia Milleron, told reporters in early April.

Shares in the company, worth $214 billion, have lost nearly 10 per cent of their value since the March 10 crash."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cra-kmpg-settlement-taxes-1.5154610,Will/can they ever go after Irving?,2.0,145.0,"The Canada Revenue Agency has once again made a secret out-of-court settlement with wealthy KPMG clients caught using what the CRA itself had alleged was a ""grossly negligent"" offshore ""sham"" set up to avoid detection by tax authorities, CBC's The Fifth Estate and Radio-Canada's Enquête have learned.

This, despite the Liberal government's vow to crack down on high-net-worth taxpayers who used the now-infamous Isle of Man scheme. The scheme orchestrated by accounting giant KPMG enabled clients to dodge tens of millions of dollars in taxes in Canada by making it look as if multimillionaires had given away their fortunes to anonymous overseas shell companies and get their investment income back as tax-free gifts.

KPMG is a global network of accounting and auditing firms headquartered out of the Netherlands and is one of the top firms in Canada.

""Tax cheats can no longer hide,"" National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier promised in 2017.

Now, Tax Court documents obtained by CBC News/Radio-Canada show two members of the Cooper family in Victoria, as well as the estate of the late patriarch Peter Cooper, reached an out-of-court settlement on May 24 over their involvement in the scheme.

Details of the settlement and even minutes of the meetings discussing it are under wraps. A CBC News/Radio-Canada reporter who showed up to one such meeting this spring left after realizing it was closed to the public.

Journalists discovered references to the final settlement agreement in Tax Court documents only by chance.

CRA cites privacy in keeping settlement details secret

The Canada Revenue Agency says strict privacy provisions of Canadian tax law make it difficult to disclose minutes describing individual taxpayer information.

The Isle of Man tax dodge had been active as far back as 1999 and, according to documents filed in Tax Court by the CRA in 2015, had ""intended to deceive"" federal regulators.

Still, significant details of the scheme remain a mystery, including the role played by the KPMG's senior executives. With no public trial, those details may continue to remain secret.

Toby Sanger, executive director of the advocacy group Canadians for Tax Fairness, says the CRA should never have agreed to settle the case.

""I think it's outrageous,"" he said. ""We've had a lot of tough talk and promises from this minister about how they will crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy and corporations, but unfortunately, we've seen no evidence of this so far.""

Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier said in an email statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête that while she cannot comment on specific cases, she finds the lack of transparency about settlements brokered by her agency ""problematic.""

""I have instructed the CRA to review its processes to allow for more transparency with respect to the reasons for which a settlement is reached,"" she said.

KPMG took 15% cut of taxes dodged

One member of the Cooper family, Marshall Cooper, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s and that it was KPMG that came up with the offshore tax plan.

Documents show KPMG planned to take a 15 per cent cut of the taxes dodged, including $300,000 from the Cooper family. Internal records show the scheme was marketed across the country, with successful KPMG sales agents and accountants referred to as product ""champions.""

Tax court documents obtained by CBC News/Radio-Canada show members of the Cooper family in Victoria reached an out-of-court settlement with CRA. Marshall Cooper, pictured, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s. (Facebook)

In all, more than 20 wealthy families participated in the offshore scheme.

Two years ago, Lebouthillier issued a news release outlining her intention to clamp down on the KPMG scheme, publicly stating that those involved could even face criminal charges over possible ""tax fraud.""

""The case of KPMG is before the courts right now, and we continue to pursue action against KPMG,"" Lebouthillier said in 2017 in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""We will see this to the end as Canadians have asked us to do.""

She said at the time that her government took the matter ""very seriously.""

""Those who choose to participate in these schemes must face the consequences of their actions,"" she said in a separate statement.

Yet more than two years after that pledge, participants in the KPMG scheme, namely, members of the Cooper family, were offered a secret out-of-court settlement.

In her statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête this week, Lebouthillier said the decision to settle was not hers to make and that she had instructed the CRA to review its settlements to ""allow for more transparency.""

Minister says 'systemic changes' are coming

To ""ensure integrity of our tax system,"" Lebouthillier said, out-of-court settlements are made by the CRA and the Department of Justice ""at arm's length"" from the minister and the minister's office.

""Canadians deserve a fair and equitable tax system, and we will continue to make systemic changes within the CRA to make sure that this is the case,"" she said in her statement this week.

CBC News/Radio-Canada first revealed four years ago that KPMG, one of the largest accounting firms in Canada, with tens of millions in federal contracts, had for years been running a massive offshore tax dodge for wealthy clients it had kept hidden from federal investigators.

The Trudeau government's previous tough talk on the so-called sham had come after a document leaked to The Fifth Estate/Enquête showed the CRA itself had offered a secret ""no penalties"" amnesty in May 2015 to many of the KPMG clients involved in the scheme.

The CRA offered to have them simply pay the back taxes owed — but with the condition they not tell the public about the offer.

Liberal MPs halted a parliamentary finance committee investigation in 2016 after KPMG argued the investigation could prejudice court cases. Now, it looks like those court cases might never happen. (CBC)

Stung by those revelations, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in 2017 that the government had learned a lesson from the KPMG affair and promised to do a ""better job of getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.""

Since then, the Liberal government vowed to make sure those kinds of offshore tax dodges were in the past.

In fact, it was concerns over future KPMG court cases that prompted the Liberal-dominated House of Commons finance committee to shut down its own investigation into the embattled accounting firm back in 2016.

Documents had already begun to emerge detailing the extent to which KPMG was helping clients not only dodge taxes but also hide money from potential creditors, including circumventing the Canadian Divorce Act by ""protecting"" assets from ex-spouses.

Lawyers for KPMG had argued that the ongoing finance committee investigation could prejudice cases before the court.

Several KPMG executives had been named to testify in the spring of 2016, but Liberal MPs voted to shut down the inquiry, arguing that any more testimony and documents should be produced in court and not in Parliament.

Now, it appears that those future court cases cited as a reason for shutting down the investigation might never materialize.

The Fifth Estate and Enquête also later revealed that in June 2016, around the same time the Liberal MPs shut down their investigation, a former senior KPMG executive was appointed to the Liberal Party's national board of directors.

""There is no reason why the finance committee shouldn't restart their hearings,"" Canadians for Tax Fairness's Sanger said.

Settlements offer 'substantial savings to the public'

Sanger said it all seems like a Liberal ""coverup"" to close down the KPMG investigation.

Canadians still do not know who were the key people at KPMG involved in running the investigation, for example, how high up it went within the organization, or all the names of the wealthy clients who participated.

Max Weder, the lawyer for the Cooper family, said he ""can't comment on the settlement.""

Documents show the family paid virtually no tax over a span of eight years — and even obtained federal and provincial tax credits — despite receiving nearly $6 million from an offshore company worth $26 million that KPMG helped set up.

KPMG has always maintained the scheme was legal. The firm's lawyers claimed any money the Coopers received were gifts and therefore non-taxable. Nevertheless, KPMG now says it would not set up this type of offshore structure anymore.

For its part, the CRA said that the settlement was made in accordance with the law and is ""supported by the facts of this particular case."" The agency also said it ""maximized revenue"" by making a decision to settle out of court, instead of facing an uncertain ruling in Tax Court.

""There is generally substantial savings to the public and a benefit to the justice system when cases are resolved through a settlement,"" a CRA spokesperson said in a statement.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/edward-downey-murder-baillie-marsman-1.5143721,Bring back the chair.,5.0,16.0,"""Callous"" killer Edward Downey, who murdered a five-year-old girl and her mother, has been sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole for 50 years.

In December, a jury convicted Edward Downey of first-degree murder in the deaths of Sara Baillie and her daughter, Taliyah Marsman, 5, who were killed on July 11, 2016.

Downey, 49, will be 96 years old when he can apply for release from prison.

""The gravity of the offence, Mr. Downey's moral blameworthiness and his degree of responsibility are at the highest level. After kidnapping Taliyah, Mr. Downey planned and deliberated upon her murder for some hours before he killed her,"" wrote Court of Queen's Bench Justice Beth Hughes in her decision.

Both victims died by asphyxiation. Baillie was found wrapped in duct tape and stuffed inside a laundry hamper. Her daughter's body was found days later, in a rural area east of the city.

'Just about out the door'

Baillie had witnessed Downey abuse her best friend, a woman who can only be identified as AB.

Downey blamed Baillie for encouraging his girlfriend — the victim's best friend — to break up with him. This would have meant Downey, who was broke, would soon be homeless as well.

On the morning of July 11, 2016, ""Ms. Baillie was just about out the door to take Taliyah to daycare when Mr. Downey arrived,"" wrote Hughes.

Downey wrapped duct tape around Baillie's face, hands and wrists, smothering and then strangling her before stuffing her body in a hamper. He then took Taliyah for several hours before deciding to kill the child as well.

After he killed his victims and while he was in the middle of dumping the child, Downey was exchanging flirtatious text messages with a woman.

Those messages show Downey felt no remorse, according to the judge.

Taliyah 'the sole witness'

Though he had hours to change his mind, Downey murdered Taliyah because she would have been able to identify him as her mother's killer.

""By murdering Taliyah, Mr. Downey killed the sole witness to her mother's murder. His text conversations after dumping Taliyah's body outside of the city reveal a callous and remorseless individual,"" wrote Hughes.

Before handing down her sentence on Tuesday, Hughes rejected Downey's bid for a mistrial.

Defence lawyer Gavin Wolch had argued for a judicial review based on the discovery of one juror's political connections which could have been in contravention of the Jury Act which prohibits certain people from serving based on political employment.

Baillie's uncle Scott Hamilton spoke outside the courtroom after the sentence was handed down, thanking police, prosecutors Carla MacPhail and Ryan Jenkins and the judge."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/rugby-federation-cancels-games-1.5120503,"There are plenty of sports that do not involve repeated blows to the head, but do  require aggression, strength, cardio, teamwork, competitiveness, balance, speed, quick thinking, fair play, etc.  everything a parent could ever dream of a child learning from sport.",5.0,58.0,"Players, parents and coaches are angry that the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation has decided to cancel public school rugby games across the province because of safety concerns.

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

Claire Avery, a rugby player at Charles P. Allen High School, said she and her teammates were shocked and devastated by the news.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Brooklyn Peyton, who plays rugby for Lockview High School in Fall River, hoped she would go to university on a rugby scholarship.

She said she's blown away by news of the cancellation.

'I just love the team'

""I started with this team, it's important to me, they are like family,"" she said. ""My coach means a lot to me. He's kind of like my second dad ... I just love the team.""

She and other rugby players at Lockview plan to wear their jerseys to school Friday and play some informal games on the school field to show support for the team.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the group has asked to meet with the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation about the decision to cancel school rugby. (CBC)

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-reycling-explainer-1.5089661",5.0,134.0,"For the second time in five weeks, an angry government in Asia is demanding Canada take back unwanted waste.

First it was the Philippines — now Malaysia .

Many Canadians have been surprised — and unhappy — to learn that Canada sends vast amounts of its recyclable waste overseas.

They've been dutifully putting their plastic, glass and paper into the blue bin, believing they are doing the right thing for the environment. But the recycling process can be complicated, and the outcome isn't always as green as we might think.

What happens to what I put in the blue bin?

According to Myra Hird of the School of Environmental Studies at Queen's University, we don't really know.

""People think that when they put something in their recycling bin, it's actually going to be recycled. But this is not the case.""

She said the waste might be recycled, but everything depends on market value. (More on that later.)

You may be tossing your recyclables into a blue bin supplied by a municipal recycling program, but the municipal government's responsibility ends once the blue bin contents are sold to a recycling company. Waste and recycling is for the most part handled by private industry in Canada.

Canadian recycling companies take the material from municipal programs and sort it, clean it and compress it into smaller cubes. Those cubes are then put up for auction.

""[Municipalities] are only responsible for that first contract,"" said Hird. They need to know where the recycling and the waste first goes. After that, they're not responsible for knowing the rest of that chain.""

Recycling is a ritual in a lot of Canadian homes, and we do it with the best intentions. But intentions in our kitchens may not be good enough. Media ID: 2:20

Who buys it?

It might be bought by a Canadian company that will further process it into pellets that are sold to the plastics industry to be used in new products — such as pipes or plastic bags.

But it could also be bought by a recycling broker who will sell it again — often to companies overseas who seek to make a profit from it. All perfectly legal. But, said Hird, hard to follow.

""These brokers mean that these contracts can change hands several times between the source and the destination."" And, she said, there is no accountability.

For years, China was a huge market for the developed world's plastic waste, taking in about 45 per cent of the world's plastics waste since 1992 . But last year, China announced it no longer wants it. Canada, and other countries, needed to find new markets.

How is Canadian plastic waste ending up in Asian countries?

""We don't like to keep our waste around,"" said Hird, ""so we move it between regions. We transport waste to the United States, to South Korea, to obviously, Malaysia, the Philippines and elsewhere.""

And while companies in those countries may be willing to buy it, governments in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam started to crack down late last year — imposing bans and stricter regulations.

Malaysia's environment minister opened a container of contaminated Canadian plastic scrap at Port Klang. The country says it will send the unwanted waste back. (Eric Szeto/CBC)

Companies buy recyclable waste, because they can make money on it. This is where market value comes in. But recycling, said Hird, is not a stable industry.

""Something that we put in the recycling bin in January … that may get recycled if there's value in it, if there's a market in it."" But if there's no market, she said, then by November or December, that same material might be put in landfill because there's no longer a significant profit to be made.

What's more, said Martin Vogt, president of Ontario-based company EFS-plastics, overseas companies do not always recycle all of what we send. ""They're picking out the good plastics, and that plastic will be recycled. But most of it ends up in the oceans, in landfills … and sometimes it's burned.""

How much does Canada recycle itself?

Much less than you might think.

""Canada recycles only nine per cent of the plastic that we use here in this country,"" according to Keith Brooks of Environment Defence.

And Hird cautions that Canadians are not made aware of the costs of recycling. ""Recycling means changing that material, which often involves significant transportation.""

She uses an example of polystyrene — a standard, versatile foam plastic used to make everything from food containers to protective packaging — that is collected in Kingston.

""[It] gets shipped to northern Ontario using trucks that use non-renewable fossil fuels. It's then liquefied and made smaller, more compact, and then it's put on more trucks which are then taken to Montreal, which then are put on ships that go to the United States and go to South Korea. All of this for one more use for that polystyrene.""

So is recycling in Canada working?

According to Brooks, not really.

""We need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use. That means banning some plastic [by] the government. We need to hold producers responsible for this plastic ultimately — that's a really important thing. And we need government to take action to do that.

In British Columbia, legislation shifted the onus of handling recycling onto the businesses that create the waste, something known as ""extended producer responsibility."" Recycle B.C, a non-profit, took responsibility for the province's waste recycling about five years ago. It works to keep contamination levels low, so its recycled products are usually higher quality, making them easier to sell.

And Recycle B.C. spokesperson David Lefebvre told CBC News in April,""all of the plastic that's collected here in the province ends up here in B.C.""

There are calls for the Canadian government to create a stronger end market for recyclables, by making it mandatory for manufacturers to use a certain amount of recycled material in new products. (CBC News)

Is there a solution?

Vogt agrees the solution requires government involvement, but had a different take than Brooks.

He said governments need to, ""come out and say we need to have recycled content in our products in order to create the circle economy and basically get the industry going.""

But Brooks and Hird both say the real solution lies in reducing all waste, not relying on recycling."

Yes, I also have relatives who are Muslim.


&gt; Does she have a political agenda?

&gt; Rest assured that you and others are just the latest in a long line of people who think the best way to liberate a woman is to think for her and decide what she may wear and not wear (at work or at home)

I don't know if you actually read the contents of the bill but no one is going to force anyone to not wear it in public or at home. When you, however, are working for the state, the bill says you should take off religious symbols because one of the values of Québec is that it is a secular society.",12.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

""Afterlife's conduct, aptly characterized as 'obituary piracy,' is high-handed, reprehensible and represented a marked departure from standards of decency,"" wrote Justice Catherine Kane.

Afterlife effectively copied and pasted obituaries and photographs that had been published elsewhere, and passed the content off as its own.

It was like someone had ripped my chest out again. - Raylene Manning-Puddister, grieving mom

It outraged families by selling memorial-themed products like candles and sympathy cards that unwitting friends and family could purchase — but with all the revenue going to Afterlife.

She ordered Afterlife — run by Pascal Leclerc — to pay $20 million in damages, and an injunction against the website to prevent it from operating in the future.

Leclerc initially hired a lawyer to handle his defence, but eventually backed out of the proceedings, leading to Kane issuing a default judgment.

Shock and disgust

Thomson's father, Denis Trainor, passed away in early 2017. A year later, she saw his obituary posted on Afterlife's website, where people could pay for things like digital flowers and candles.

""Ms. Thomson described her outrage and mortification that others would think she sought to profit from her father's death,"" wrote Kane.

While Thomson was the face case for the class action, the lawsuit was launched after events set in motion by a different grieving Newfoundlander.

Raylene Manning-Puddister was sitting at home one morning when she went to Google her son's baseball stats.

Although she has them memorized, she said, ""being a bereaved mom, it's just a dark road you walk every day of your life.""

Instead, she found his obituary as one of the top hits.

It was the same one she had written in 2012, when her 22-year-old-son, Tyller Pittman, passed away. To her surprise, it was posted on a site she had never seen before.

You would have a heart of stone if you were not moved by these people. - Erin Best, lawyer

""His obituary was literally word for word. The same pictures. There wasn't even any change in what I wrote myself.""

Afterlife had even used a poem Manning-Puddister had written for her son, placed alongside paid advertising and options to purchase digital tokens of sympathy.

""It was like someone had ripped my chest out again. I felt like I'd literally gotten kicked in the stomach,"" she said. ""Who in the world would do something so horrific to take advantage of bereaved parents, of people that lost their parents?""

Manning-Puddister called into CBC's St. John's Morning Show, where she shared her story and questioned how it was legal.

CBC then called Best to weigh in on whether it was copyright infringement. She later decided to file a lawsuit.

'They were absolutely devastated'

In her ruling, Kane said the site had infringed on copyrights by lifting the obituaries and photos of the deceased from other websites.

She awarded $10 million in statutory damages and $10 million in aggravated damages.

Best said once she announced she was filing a suit, she was bombarded with people who were furious, hurt, shocked and disgusted by Afterlife.

""You would have a heart of stone if you were not moved by these people,"" she said. ""They were absolutely devastated ... they felt like it was a kick in the stomach at their most vulnerable time.""

Whether any of the plaintiffs will see any money remains to be seen, Best said.

The site had posted more than one million Canadian obituaries at the time it was taken down. Afterlife now directs people to another website, Everhere, which the judge said is also run by Leclerc.

Everhere drew ire in Saskatchewan last year when families of victims of the Humboldt Broncos crash learned it was selling similar products without their permission.

Kane requested the injunction should name Leclerc personally, so he cannot continue posting obituaries on Everhere.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/transmountain-pipeline-environment-question-1.5147454,"/u/Oldmanthrowaway12345 I'd like to hear your thoughts on why exporting diluted bitumen is comparable to localized use of refined oil products, or on how diluted bitumen cannot be cleaned from salt water and how that relates to BCs economy.",-2.0,27.0,"B.C.'s Court of Appeal will decide Friday whether the province can change its environmental laws in a way that could effectively kill the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.

The province's top court was asked to weigh in on proposed amendments to B.C.'s Environmental Management Act forcing anyone wanting to transport increased quantities of ""heavy oil"" to seek provincial permission.

While B.C.'s attorney general argues the government has the right to enact laws aimed at protecting British Columbians from the effects of a catastrophic spill, Ottawa claims the move is a ruse designed with just one target in mind: the proposed twinning of a 1,150 pipeline to move bitumen from Edmonton to the West Coast.

The case revolves around weighty legal and constitutional issues, but it boils down to a few fundamental questions about the role of government in the lives of Canadians — and the balance between local and national interests.

In his opening arguments, Joseph Arvay, counsel for B.C., pointed to the array of lawyers for ""pipelines and railways and others in the oil and gas industry"" who had lined up to oppose him.

He claimed their arguments all boiled down to one thing:

""That even if the pipelines or railways they own or operate create a risk of even catastrophic environmental harm because of the substance they carry, the province is nevertheless powerless to enact laws to prevent that risk from materializing,"" Arvay told the five appeal court judges.

""We say that the province is not required to accept such a fate.""

'A Trojan horse'

The appeal court battle is the latest in a series of legal and political hurdles the pipeline expansion has faced since then-owner Kinder Morgan first lodged its plans with the National Energy Board (NEB) in 2013.

Last year, the federal government announced plans to buy the $4.5 billion pipeline from Kinder Morgan shareholders, who expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the approval process.

The Federal Court of Appeal put the project on hold in 2018 after finding that the government had not adequately consulted with First Nations and the NEB had failed to fully consider impacts on marine life.

Ottawa has since moved to rectify those shortcomings.

The reference question was debated over five days in March. It's one of the rare proceedings B.C.'s appeal court has decided to webcast.

Jan Brongers, lawyer for Canada's attorney general, acknowledged the ""superficial attraction"" of Arvay's argument. But he warned the judges against falling for it.

""Our main concern is that this legislation appears to be a Trojan horse,"" he said.

""It's one that's designed to appear as constitutionally acceptable local environmental protection measures, but in substance it's an unconstitutional initiative whose only logical reason for being is to limit federally regulated pipelines and railways from moving additional quantities of heavy oil.""

The court has been asked to consider three basic questions:

Does B.C. have the authority to enact the proposed amendments?

Would those rules apply to ""heavy oil"" from another province?

Would existing federal legislation trump the provincial rules in any event?

The federal government argued that it has exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines and railways, and that B.C.'s legislation is simply a bid to kill a project the provincial NDP government vigorously opposes.

But Arvay claimed B.C. isn't trying to usurp Ottawa's power — that instead the proposed amendments would work in tandem with federal laws to ensure locals are protected from the risks of projects in their backyards.

""Decisions affecting individuals should as far as reasonably possible be made by the level of government closest to the individuals affected,"" he told the court.

Strange bedfellows

A host of intervenors have lined up on either side of the debate, with the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby supporting British Columbia along with the Assembly of First Nations.

""Local governments and First Nations governments are on the front lines of emergency response for their communities,"" the City of Vancouver said in its written arguments.

""It is these communities that are at risk from a heavy oil accident and who will suffer the impacts.""

Several individual First Nations have also aligned themselves with the government of Canada, along with a number of oil and gas industry groups and the attorneys general of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Alberta said the provinces and Ottawa should work together to protect the environment, but B.C. can't take unilateral steps that would result in the obstruction or delay of the project.

Regardless of what the appeal court decides, the ultimate decision on the law is likely to rest with the Supreme Court of Canada."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/magic-mushrooms-decriminalization-denver-1.5128824,"The culture surrounding a drug plays a role in the expectations and handling of it for sure. Psilocybin has gained a lot of popular attention lately as a neutropic, taken in tiny fractions of what it would take to trip, and it's being hailed as a solution for building new brain cells. The commercial interests surrounding psilocybin will definitely weigh in on the way people use them. They are far from secret now.",1.0,14.0,"Voters narrowly made Denver the first U.S. city to decriminalize psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in ""magic mushrooms.""

Decriminalization led by a slim 51 per cent, according to preliminary figures on Tuesday's election released by Denver's Election Division. As many as 1,300 votes still remain to be counted, but that figure was not enough to swing the vote the other way, division spokesperson Alton Dillard said.

Final election results will be released on May 16, he said.

Organizers turned to the same strategy that marijuana activists used to decriminalize pot possession in the city in 2005. That move was followed by statewide legalization in 2012. A number of other states have since broadly allowed marijuana sales and use by adults.

Organizers say their only goal in the mushroom measure is to keep people out of jail in Denver for using or possessing the drug to cope with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and other conditions.

The initiative effectively decriminalizes use or possession of psilocybin by people 21 and older, making it the lowest enforcement priority for police and prosecutors. It does not legalize psilocybin or permit its sale by cannabis businesses.

Kevin Matthews, director of the Decriminalize Denver campaign, said psilocybin has helped him deal with depression for years.

""This is not something you have to take every day,"" the 33-year-old Denver native said. ""It provides a lot of lasting benefits, weeks and months after one experience.""

Used in religious practices

Psilocybin has been federally outlawed since the 1960s, when it was widely known as a recreational drug. The ban stymied medical research, but small studies in recent years have found the substance had positive effects on anxiety and depression for cancer patients.

Users have described seeing vivid colours and geometric patterns and experiencing powerful spiritual connections and emotions.

Magic mushrooms have been used in religious practices for decades because of their powerful effect on perceptions and spiritual experiences. Those same effects have appealed to recreational users dating to the 1960s counterculture movement.

A California effort to decriminalize psilocybin failed to qualify for the statewide ballot in 2018. Organizers in Oregon are trying to gather enough support to put an initiative to a statewide vote next year.

Mayor opposed initiative

It took the pro-psilocybin organizers in Denver three tries to develop language approved by city officials for the ballot. They collected more than 8,000 signatures to qualify for Tuesday's election.

Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and District Attorney Beth McCann opposed the initiative, but there was no organized campaign against decriminalization. The city's election largely focused on a six-way race for mayor and a heated effort to end Denver's ""urban camping"" ban that affects people without housing.

Voters roundly rejected an end to the camping ban. In the mayor's race, incumbent Michael Hancock will face a June 4 runoff election against challenger Jamie Giellis.

The mushroom ordinance also prevents city funds from being used to pursue criminal penalties on possession or use and creates a panel to study the effects of the change."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/transcanada-profit-q1-1.5121366?cmp=rss,robots,19.0,44.0,"TransCanada Corp. is officially dropping the ""Canada"" from its name, but CEO Russ Girling isn't saying he expects it will make it any easier to get pipelines approved in Canada or the United States.

The Calgary-based company is now to be called TC Energy Corp., after shareholders approved the change at its annual meeting Friday.

""The name TC Energy acknowledges our origin as TransCanada PipeLines, while adding the word 'energy' speaks to the breadth of our business, which includes pipelines, power generation and energy storage,"" Girling told the meeting.

""But to be clear, this is a name change, not a brand name. We are very proud of who we are and what we do.""

He declined to talk to reporters after the event.

The company said the change recognizes its growth into the United States and Mexico, including through its recent $13-billion US purchase of U.S. natural gas transporter Columbia Pipeline Group.

It has about 7,000 employees in North America, with 3,500 in Canada, 3,200 in the U.S. and 300 in Mexico.

But some analysts suggest it's also a chance to distance itself from Canada, where difficulty in getting pipeline projects approved has been blamed for a glut of oil that caused steep discount pricing last fall and prompted the Alberta government to curtail production starting in January.

""I think the name change is semantics,"" U.S.-based analyst Jennifer Rowland of Edward Jones wrote in an email.

""I don't think it attracts new investors, but I do think it's a subtle, or not so subtle depending on how you view it, way to de-emphasize Canada as some investors are leery of investing in Canada given the government intervention in free markets in Alberta and the difficult regulatory environment for energy.""

TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta into the U.S. was first proposed in 2008, rejected by then-president Barack Obama in 2015, approved by President Donald Trump in 2016 and again in March, but remains on hold awaiting court rulings in Montana and Nebraska.

The court delays mean the project will not be able to start construction in the U.S. this year, Paul Miller, president of liquids pipelines, confirmed during an afternoon conference call with financial analysts.

The project could still be unfinished if a new federal government is elected in the U.S. in 2020, he added, but it's hoped all permits and approvals will be in hand by then and a new administration won't affect bringing the project on stream.

Shareholders at the meeting voted almost 90 per cent against a motion sponsored by the Pension Plan of the United Church of Canada that would have required the company to report on how it is meeting international standards for Indigenous people's rights.

They went along with the company's recommendation to reject the motion as unnecessary given its existing policies.

The official approval of the name change came as the company reported a first-quarter profit of $1 billion of $1.09 per share, up from $734 million or 83 cents per share a year ago.

Revenue for the first quarter totalled $3.49 billion, compared with $3.42 billion in the first quarter of 2018.

On a comparable basis, TransCanada says it earned $987 million or $1.07 per share for the quarter, up from $864 million or 98 cents per share a year ago.

Analysts on average had expected a profit of 99 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon."

Roughly 1,100 people, including more than 800 students from the Seven Oaks School Division, took part, organizers estimate.

Carrying signs, the demonstrators walked from city hall down Main Street to Portage Avenue, and then up Memorial Boulevard, before ending at the Manitoba Legislative Building.

Eric Jasysyn helped organize the walk and hoped to get the attention of politicians.

""The Indigenous communities have been suffering for so long and it's time to start seeing change,"" said Jasysyn, a Grade 12 student from Seven Oaks Met School.

""We want to make sure everyone understands that water is a basic human right and everyone deserves access to clean water.""

Jasysyn points specifically to the situation at Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, which provides Winnipeg with its drinking water, yet doesn't have a water treatment facility and has been under a years-long boil water advisory.

""It is time to start seeing change and it's time to start getting them the water that they deserve,"" he said.

""We want to start getting people hearing our voices.""

According to Indigenous Services Canada, 57 First Nations across Canada were under long-term drinking water advisories, including four in Manitoba, as of April 27.

Indigenous Services Canada has set a date of March 2021 to have all long-term water advisories lifted on Canadian First Nations, and says 85 of the advisories have been lifted since November 2015.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

The company has said it's undertaking a major restructuring, and on Monday said that it will have trimmed thousands of jobs by August.

The company said the plan will save about $600 million US per year by eliminating bureaucracy and increasing the number of workers reporting to each manager.

In the U.S., about 2,300 jobs will be cut through buyouts and layoffs. About 1,500 already have happened, and some 500 workers will be let go in the U.S. and Canada this week. A final 300 will be cut in the U.S. and Canada by August, a spokesperson for Ford Canada told the CBC in an email Monday.

In a memo to employees, Monday, CEO Jim Hackett said the fourth wave of the restructuring will start on Tuesday, with the majority of cuts being finished by May 24.

To succeed in our competitive industry, and position Ford to win in a fast-changing future, we must reduce bureaucracy…and cut costs. - Jim Hackett, Ford CEO

""To succeed in our competitive industry, and position Ford to win in a fast-changing future, we must reduce bureaucracy, empower managers, speed decision making and focus on the most valuable work, and cost cuts,"" Hackett wrote.

In the U.S., about 1,500 white-collar employees have left the company voluntarily since the restructuring began last year, some taking buyouts. About 300 have been laid off already, with another 500 layoffs starting this week.

Most of Ford's white-collar workers are in and around the company's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters.

2nd recent set of layoffs

It's the second set of layoffs for Detroit-area automakers, even though the companies are making healthy profits. Sales in the U.S., where the automakers get most of their revenue, have fallen slightly but still are strong.

In November, General Motors announced it would shed up to 14,000 workers as it cut expenses to prepare for a shift to electric and autonomous vehicles.

The layoffs included closure of five factories in the U.S. and Canada and cuts of another 8,000 white-collar workers worldwide. About 5,000 blue-collar positions were cut, but most of laid-off factory workers in the U.S. will be placed at other plants mainly that build trucks and SUVs.

Both companies have said the cuts are needed to prepare for the future, because companies face huge capital expenditures to update their current vehicles and develop them for the future.

The cuts brought withering criticism of GM from U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress, especially the closing of a small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio. Trump campaigned on bringing factory jobs back to the industrial Midwest. GM has since announced a possible deal to sell the Lordstown plant to a startup electric vehicle maker, but it hasn't been finalized.

Hackett said in the memo that Ford is departing from past practices and letting laid-off employees stay a few days to wrap up their jobs and say good-bye to colleagues. In the past, laid-off workers would have had to pack up and leave immediately.

""Ford is a family company and saying goodbye to colleagues is difficult and emotional,"" Hackett wrote.

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/walk-for-water-winnipeg-1.5131285,How about the part of the deal where the government tried to eliminate them?,-10.0,109.0,"Over a thousand people poured into the streets of downtown Winnipeg Friday to bring attention to the dozens of First Nations across Canada currently under boil water advisories.

Roughly 1,100 people, including more than 800 students from the Seven Oaks School Division, took part, organizers estimate.

Carrying signs, the demonstrators walked from city hall down Main Street to Portage Avenue, and then up Memorial Boulevard, before ending at the Manitoba Legislative Building.

Eric Jasysyn helped organize the walk and hoped to get the attention of politicians.

""The Indigenous communities have been suffering for so long and it's time to start seeing change,"" said Jasysyn, a Grade 12 student from Seven Oaks Met School.

""We want to make sure everyone understands that water is a basic human right and everyone deserves access to clean water.""

Jasysyn points specifically to the situation at Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, which provides Winnipeg with its drinking water, yet doesn't have a water treatment facility and has been under a years-long boil water advisory.

""It is time to start seeing change and it's time to start getting them the water that they deserve,"" he said.

""We want to start getting people hearing our voices.""

According to Indigenous Services Canada, 57 First Nations across Canada were under long-term drinking water advisories, including four in Manitoba, as of April 27.

Indigenous Services Canada has set a date of March 2021 to have all long-term water advisories lifted on Canadian First Nations, and says 85 of the advisories have been lifted since November 2015.

""There are communities across Canada that don't have access to clean drinking water — that's a big problem.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cannabis-use-statistics-canada-1.5121125,Eat 200 mgs of THC and try to tell me it's not a powerful substance,0.0,60.0,"More Canadians say they've used cannabis recreationally since it was legalized last fall, particularly those aged 45 to 64 and males, according to Statistics Canada.

About 18 per cent of Canadians 15 and older, or about 5.3 million people, reported pot use in the last three months, the federal agency said in its quarterly report on Thursday.

Early indications point to more use right after it was legalized last October, when the reported use stood at 14 per cent.

""One of the things … unique with this survey is the number of respondents who said they're using for the first time. So they started, in this case, in the post-legalization period,"" said Michelle Rotermann, a senior analyst in Statistics Canada's health analysis division.

In the first three months of 2018, about 330,000 Canadians said they'd tried cannabis for the first time. A year later, it was up to 650,000, she said.

J.F. Crépault, a senior policy analyst at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), says the Toronto facility wants to see if the initial spike in use translates into longer-term, problematic use.

Following legalization in Colorado, for instance, cannabis use spiked, then rates went back down to about the same as in surrounding states where it remains illegal, Crépault said.

""Researchers sometimes refer to this as a 'straw fire effect' in the sense that it kind of burns bright for a very short amount of time and then goes back down,"" he said.

The greatest proportion of users are aged 18 to 25 (30 per cent) compared with people in their mid-20s and older. But an increasing proportion of new users were aged 45 and older.

The average age of a cannabis user in the country is now 38, Rotermann said.

Many of them are men. Cannabis use increased among males, from 16 per cent last year to 22 per cent so far this year. There was no change among females.

Daily, or almost daily, use of cannabis was unchanged, while weekly and occasional use increased.

Crépault said doctors and medical researchers are looking for any long-term increases in the number of people using cannabis, and, more important, people using cannabis more frequently or more heavily or, ""even worse, starting to use it earlier in life.""

Crépault said at CAMH they're keeping an eye on the national quarterly reports, but recognize that rates of use are an imperfect indicator: Not everyone in the population who uses is harmed.

Early evidence coming out of U.S. states with easier access to medical cannabis or legalized non-medical use of cannabis shows there seem to be reductions in opioid-related overdoses and fatal overdoses. That could be because people are either self-medicating or obtaining opioid prescriptions legitimately and taking the drug long-term and switching to cannabis instead, Crépault said.

He noted that in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, harm-reduction proponents are unofficially providing free cannabis to those who use injection drugs to reduce their opioid intake.

""If cannabis use does increase in the population, we need to make sure that we're also keeping track of patterns of alcohol use or opioid use. It'll take a long time for us to know for sure what the kind of relationships are between these.""

Overall, 15 per cent of cannabis users with a valid driver's licence reported driving within two hours of consuming. That amounts to 675,000 people. Experts advise waiting more than two hours before driving.

Of that group, about 15 per cent, or 125,000 people, also reported they'd consumed alcohol as well — a first for the agency to report.

Police are watching for impaired driving from alcohol, cannabis and other substances. (CBC News)

""Any impaired driving is too much,"" Rotermann said, though she acknowledged that problems with impaired driving existed before legalization of cannabis.

An estimated 47 per cent of cannabis users, or 2.5 million Canadians, bought pot legally during that time, up from 23 per cent, or 954,000 people, during the same period a year ago.

As well, 38 per cent of users said they bought cannabis illegally during the first three months of 2019, compared with 51 per cent a year earlier."

He only wants it to get worse so we can all take transit and sing kumbaya. I like some of the steps he has taken for the housing situation but overall pretty bad premier.,4.0,27.0,"B.C.'s Court of Appeal will decide Friday whether the province can change its environmental laws in a way that could effectively kill the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.

The province's top court was asked to weigh in on proposed amendments to B.C.'s Environmental Management Act forcing anyone wanting to transport increased quantities of ""heavy oil"" to seek provincial permission.

While B.C.'s attorney general argues the government has the right to enact laws aimed at protecting British Columbians from the effects of a catastrophic spill, Ottawa claims the move is a ruse designed with just one target in mind: the proposed twinning of a 1,150 pipeline to move bitumen from Edmonton to the West Coast.

The case revolves around weighty legal and constitutional issues, but it boils down to a few fundamental questions about the role of government in the lives of Canadians — and the balance between local and national interests.

In his opening arguments, Joseph Arvay, counsel for B.C., pointed to the array of lawyers for ""pipelines and railways and others in the oil and gas industry"" who had lined up to oppose him.

He claimed their arguments all boiled down to one thing:

""That even if the pipelines or railways they own or operate create a risk of even catastrophic environmental harm because of the substance they carry, the province is nevertheless powerless to enact laws to prevent that risk from materializing,"" Arvay told the five appeal court judges.

""We say that the province is not required to accept such a fate.""

'A Trojan horse'

The appeal court battle is the latest in a series of legal and political hurdles the pipeline expansion has faced since then-owner Kinder Morgan first lodged its plans with the National Energy Board (NEB) in 2013.

Last year, the federal government announced plans to buy the $4.5 billion pipeline from Kinder Morgan shareholders, who expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the approval process.

The Federal Court of Appeal put the project on hold in 2018 after finding that the government had not adequately consulted with First Nations and the NEB had failed to fully consider impacts on marine life.

Ottawa has since moved to rectify those shortcomings.

The reference question was debated over five days in March. It's one of the rare proceedings B.C.'s appeal court has decided to webcast.

Jan Brongers, lawyer for Canada's attorney general, acknowledged the ""superficial attraction"" of Arvay's argument. But he warned the judges against falling for it.

""Our main concern is that this legislation appears to be a Trojan horse,"" he said.

""It's one that's designed to appear as constitutionally acceptable local environmental protection measures, but in substance it's an unconstitutional initiative whose only logical reason for being is to limit federally regulated pipelines and railways from moving additional quantities of heavy oil.""

The court has been asked to consider three basic questions:

Does B.C. have the authority to enact the proposed amendments?

Would those rules apply to ""heavy oil"" from another province?

Would existing federal legislation trump the provincial rules in any event?

The federal government argued that it has exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines and railways, and that B.C.'s legislation is simply a bid to kill a project the provincial NDP government vigorously opposes.

But Arvay claimed B.C. isn't trying to usurp Ottawa's power — that instead the proposed amendments would work in tandem with federal laws to ensure locals are protected from the risks of projects in their backyards.

""Decisions affecting individuals should as far as reasonably possible be made by the level of government closest to the individuals affected,"" he told the court.

Strange bedfellows

A host of intervenors have lined up on either side of the debate, with the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby supporting British Columbia along with the Assembly of First Nations.

""Local governments and First Nations governments are on the front lines of emergency response for their communities,"" the City of Vancouver said in its written arguments.

""It is these communities that are at risk from a heavy oil accident and who will suffer the impacts.""

Several individual First Nations have also aligned themselves with the government of Canada, along with a number of oil and gas industry groups and the attorneys general of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Alberta said the provinces and Ottawa should work together to protect the environment, but B.C. can't take unilateral steps that would result in the obstruction or delay of the project.

Regardless of what the appeal court decides, the ultimate decision on the law is likely to rest with the Supreme Court of Canada."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cra-kmpg-settlement-taxes-1.5154610,"In cases like these, I don't believe the clients should be afforded the protection of anonymity.

This, despite the Liberal government's vow to crack down on high-net-worth taxpayers who used the now-infamous Isle of Man scheme. The scheme orchestrated by accounting giant KPMG enabled clients to dodge tens of millions of dollars in taxes in Canada by making it look as if multimillionaires had given away their fortunes to anonymous overseas shell companies and get their investment income back as tax-free gifts.

KPMG is a global network of accounting and auditing firms headquartered out of the Netherlands and is one of the top firms in Canada.

""Tax cheats can no longer hide,"" National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier promised in 2017.

Now, Tax Court documents obtained by CBC News/Radio-Canada show two members of the Cooper family in Victoria, as well as the estate of the late patriarch Peter Cooper, reached an out-of-court settlement on May 24 over their involvement in the scheme.

Details of the settlement and even minutes of the meetings discussing it are under wraps. A CBC News/Radio-Canada reporter who showed up to one such meeting this spring left after realizing it was closed to the public.

Journalists discovered references to the final settlement agreement in Tax Court documents only by chance.

CRA cites privacy in keeping settlement details secret

The Canada Revenue Agency says strict privacy provisions of Canadian tax law make it difficult to disclose minutes describing individual taxpayer information.

The Isle of Man tax dodge had been active as far back as 1999 and, according to documents filed in Tax Court by the CRA in 2015, had ""intended to deceive"" federal regulators.

Still, significant details of the scheme remain a mystery, including the role played by the KPMG's senior executives. With no public trial, those details may continue to remain secret.

Toby Sanger, executive director of the advocacy group Canadians for Tax Fairness, says the CRA should never have agreed to settle the case.

""I think it's outrageous,"" he said. ""We've had a lot of tough talk and promises from this minister about how they will crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy and corporations, but unfortunately, we've seen no evidence of this so far.""

Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier said in an email statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête that while she cannot comment on specific cases, she finds the lack of transparency about settlements brokered by her agency ""problematic.""

""I have instructed the CRA to review its processes to allow for more transparency with respect to the reasons for which a settlement is reached,"" she said.

KPMG took 15% cut of taxes dodged

One member of the Cooper family, Marshall Cooper, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s and that it was KPMG that came up with the offshore tax plan.

Documents show KPMG planned to take a 15 per cent cut of the taxes dodged, including $300,000 from the Cooper family. Internal records show the scheme was marketed across the country, with successful KPMG sales agents and accountants referred to as product ""champions.""

Marshall Cooper, pictured, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s. (Facebook)

In all, more than 20 wealthy families participated in the offshore scheme.

Two years ago, Lebouthillier issued a news release outlining her intention to clamp down on the KPMG scheme, publicly stating that those involved could even face criminal charges over possible ""tax fraud.""

""The case of KPMG is before the courts right now, and we continue to pursue action against KPMG,"" Lebouthillier said in 2017 in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""We will see this to the end as Canadians have asked us to do.""

She said at the time that her government took the matter ""very seriously.""

""Those who choose to participate in these schemes must face the consequences of their actions,"" she said in a separate statement.

Yet more than two years after that pledge, participants in the KPMG scheme, namely, members of the Cooper family, were offered a secret out-of-court settlement.

In her statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête this week, Lebouthillier said the decision to settle was not hers to make and that she had instructed the CRA to review its settlements to ""allow for more transparency.""

Minister says 'systemic changes' are coming

To ""ensure integrity of our tax system,"" Lebouthillier said, out-of-court settlements are made by the CRA and the Department of Justice ""at arm's length"" from the minister and the minister's office.

""Canadians deserve a fair and equitable tax system, and we will continue to make systemic changes within the CRA to make sure that this is the case,"" she said in her statement this week.

CBC News/Radio-Canada first revealed four years ago that KPMG, one of the largest accounting firms in Canada, with tens of millions in federal contracts, had for years been running a massive offshore tax dodge for wealthy clients it had kept hidden from federal investigators.

The Trudeau government's previous tough talk on the so-called sham had come after a document leaked to The Fifth Estate/Enquête showed the CRA itself had offered a secret ""no penalties"" amnesty in May 2015 to many of the KPMG clients involved in the scheme.

The CRA offered to have them simply pay the back taxes owed — but with the condition they not tell the public about the offer.

Liberal MPs halted a parliamentary finance committee investigation in 2016 after KPMG argued the investigation could prejudice court cases. Now, it looks like those court cases might never happen. (CBC)

Stung by those revelations, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in 2017 that the government had learned a lesson from the KPMG affair and promised to do a ""better job of getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.""

Since then, the Liberal government vowed to make sure those kinds of offshore tax dodges were in the past.

In fact, it was concerns over future KPMG court cases that prompted the Liberal-dominated House of Commons finance committee to shut down its own investigation into the embattled accounting firm back in 2016.

Documents had already begun to emerge detailing the extent to which KPMG was helping clients not only dodge taxes but also hide money from potential creditors, including circumventing the Canadian Divorce Act by ""protecting"" assets from ex-spouses.

Lawyers for KPMG had argued that the ongoing finance committee investigation could prejudice cases before the court.

Several KPMG executives had been named to testify in the spring of 2016, but Liberal MPs voted to shut down the inquiry, arguing that any more testimony and documents should be produced in court and not in Parliament.

Now, it appears that those future court cases cited as a reason for shutting down the investigation might never materialize.

The Fifth Estate and Enquête also later revealed that in June 2016, around the same time the Liberal MPs shut down their investigation, a former senior KPMG executive was appointed to the Liberal Party's national board of directors.

""There is no reason why the finance committee shouldn't restart their hearings,"" Canadians for Tax Fairness's Sanger said.

Settlements offer 'substantial savings to the public'

Sanger said it all seems like a Liberal ""coverup"" to close down the KPMG investigation.

Canadians still do not know who were the key people at KPMG involved in running the investigation, for example, how high up it went within the organization, or all the names of the wealthy clients who participated.

Max Weder, the lawyer for the Cooper family, said he ""can't comment on the settlement.""

Documents show the family paid virtually no tax over a span of eight years — and even obtained federal and provincial tax credits — despite receiving nearly $6 million from an offshore company worth $26 million that KPMG helped set up.

KPMG has always maintained the scheme was legal. The firm's lawyers claimed any money the Coopers received were gifts and therefore non-taxable. Nevertheless, KPMG now says it would not set up this type of offshore structure anymore.

For its part, the CRA said that the settlement was made in accordance with the law and is ""supported by the facts of this particular case."" The agency also said it ""maximized revenue"" by making a decision to settle out of court, instead of facing an uncertain ruling in Tax Court.

""There is generally substantial savings to the public and a benefit to the justice system when cases are resolved through a settlement,"" a CRA spokesperson said in a statement.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/national-electric-vehicles-pros-cons-1.5119687,I've never understood the ugly EV phenomenon. Who the hell designed the i3 and why?,7.0,51.0,"The cars pass almost silently, but you see hundreds of them on the streets. Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

Fancy book learning has nothing on hard work and experience, that's why literally every aspect of the world has gotten worse in the past thirty years.",1.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

The reduction includes a $28 million cut to the $1.5 billion the province gives 49 children’s aid societies in Ontario, increasing concerns about the ability of agencies to serve and protect vulnerable children. The cut comes as 18 child protection agencies struggle with deficits totalling more than $12 million.

The deficits have already forced some agencies to lay off staff and reduce the number of children at risk they take into care.

“A decrease in children in care does not mean there are fewer children in need of protection,” the OACAS warned in a PowerPoint produced in late March, outlining its core messages before the provincial budget was tabled.

The association’s post-budget analysis suggests their warning may not have been heard.

The $84.5 million cut for youth at risk is contained in a May 16 “briefing note” the OACAS sent to top CAS officials, and obtained by the Star. The calculations are based on the government’s operating and capital spending estimates tabled in the legislature May 9.

Anti-poverty advocates shaken by cuts contemplated by Ford government

Opinion | Martin Regg Cohn: Secret document shows how far Doug Ford’s Tories would cut social services — until they were talked back from the brink

The OACAS calculated funding envelopes that fall under the budget line of “child and youth at risk,” including services for child protection and youth involved with the justice system.

The association is uncertain about the full impact of the cuts. Some funding envelopes have been eliminated and new ones created. It’s unclear if programs funded under the eliminated envelopes will continue to be funded under the new ones. Some of the cuts may involve the closing of unused facilities or resources, particularly in the area of youth justice. But when all the pluses and minuses are calculated, the funding shortfall is $84.5 million, according to the OACAS.

“We are concerned about the impact of any potential cuts to our members and to the families that they serve,” Nicole Bonnie, chief executive officer of the OACAS said in an email response to questions.

“At this time we do not have details as to which programs will be funded or who will deliver them,” Bonnie added. “We are waiting for more detailed information from the ministry to understand the exact nature of the impact on child welfare.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Bonnie hopes to soon meet with Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. “Our message is and always has been that the children and families we serve are the most marginalized and disenfranchised, and programs that support their well-being need to be fully funded.”

The minister’s office did not respond to direct questions about the cuts. In an emailed statement, MacLeod’s press secretary, Derek Rowland, described the well-being of vulnerable young people as the government’s “utmost priority.” The steady decline of children being taken into care since 2006, he added, has helped most children’s aid societies balance their budgets and the ministry is working with those that haven’t.

“We will be holding Ontario’s Children’s Aid Societies and other providers to higher standards to keep our kids safe,” Rowland said, denouncing what he described as “the lack of oversight and relaxed regulation” of the previous Liberal government.

Rowland said the government is increasing investments in prevention programs “to ensure kids keep out of trouble.” The government also “expects significant savings” in the youth justice sector after a review found “underutilized detention facilities.”

A plan to reduce the number of children’s aid societies through amalgamation is also being considered by the ministry.

What isn’t in doubt is that children’s aid societies will have less core funding to work with.

One children’s aid society, Brant Family and Children’s Services, has struggled with deficits that forced the layoff of 26 workers in March, in a community facing perhaps the worst opioid addiction epidemic in the province. Its executive director then posted a letter to the Brantford area community on the agency’s website, warning of serious consequences.

“When governments cut child welfare services (managers, front-line staff, and support services), children ultimately die or are allowed by society to live in unbearable, violent and neglectful conditions,” Andy Koster wrote.

“With higher caseloads and tight timelines, workers are forced to move from one crisis to another instead of planning and working proactively with families to prevent future incidents,” he added. “Despite best efforts, children fall through the cracks and suffer the consequences of insufficient resources.”

The cuts for children at risk also comes on the heels of the government eliminating the office that advocated for children and youth.

Kiaras Gharabaghi, director of Ryerson University’s School of Child and Youth Care, denounced the cuts as implemented without consultations.

“They are cuts that have no interest in making the system work better for kids and families,” he said in an interview after reviewing the OACAS document.

“This sector requires a different approach,” Gharabaghi added. “It’s one where young people die by violence, by suicide, by neglect. It’s not the same as increasing class sizes in schools to save some money.”

Come on ... they'll give the union a say, but not the ownership?",4.0,168.0,"Transcript

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is defending a decision to give a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservative Party a role in determining which news organizations are eligible for government funding.

Eight Canadian organizations will select representatives to sit on an advisory panel that will decide how the government should dole out $600-million media support fund, the government announced Wednesday.

They are News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

Unifor — a union that has actively campaigned against the Conservatives under both Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer — represents more than 12,000 journalists and media workers in Canada.

In a statement posted to Facebook, Unifor said critics are mischaracterizing its role on the panel. The union says it will help define the criteria through which the funds will be allocated, but won't be directly involved in deciding who gets the money.

""There is a lot at stake as we work to protect and preserve our news industry in Canada and after years of discussion we finally have a path forward,"" the union said.

As It Happens has reached out to Unifor for comment.

Rodriguez spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the new panel. Here is part of their conversation.

I don't know if you had a chance to read Chris Selley at the National Post ... who says that that your putting Unifor on this panel is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens. How do you respond?

We chose different organizations that represent journalists and different media across the country with different regions being represented, both official languages, the ethnic press.

We wanted to make sure that it was representative of the industry, and that's the reason why they're all there.

Why Unifor?

It represents thousands of employees from the news sector.

But it also represents a very, very strong bias, doesn't it? Because Unifor has made it quite clear that they call themselves ""the resistance."" They have put out publicity. I'm sure you've seen their publicity: ""The resistance: Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" If you want to have a panel that appears to be unbiased, how does that help you?

This is Andrew Scheer's opinion, and ...

Excuse me. No, no. This is not Andrew Scheer's opinion. I'm looking at a picture put out. This is Unifor Canada's picture.

We're talking about professionals, which is the case of all the groups there are on this list.

And the reason why we wanted to intervene is because professional journalism is one of the pillars of democracy. And the Conservatives may think that, ""Well, you know what? We shouldn't do anything and then let them all die.""

On the contrary, we're saying, ""No, we have to be there to support them with one clear principle — to respect the freedom and independence of the press.""

Unifor posted this image in a November 2018 tweet that read: 'Unifor’s National Executive Board started planning for the federal election today @AndrewScheer #canlab #canpoli.' (@UniforTheUnion/Twitter)

That's not the issue here. The issue is that you said you were going to put together a panel, an advisory panel, to decide who is going to get the funds, the $600 million worth of support to the media in this country, and that you would have an unbiased and an independent panel.

Yes, which is the case.

Mr. Rodriguez, have you not seen the publicity that Unifor is putting out calling themselves ""the resistance"" and saying, ""Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."" Have you not seen that?

I know what you're talking about.

The Conservatives are saying that Unifor, any people working or any journalists, can be bought by this program, which is not the case, and I think it's an insult to professional journalists that build their career on integrity and on independence and on professionalism.

We're talking about the people on the panel. We're not talking about the journalists who might be benefiting from these funds. We saw that Unifor, it was quite partisan during the 2015 election campaign, that they put out attack ads against Stephen Harper's Conservatives, which surely helped you get elected. So, again, we're back to this problem of an appearance of bias. That if you have, if you are giving this position to Unifor, to the union, to decide who is going to get this funding, when it's an organization that has clearly come out ... going against your political enemies, that's a problem, isn't it?

This is repeating what Andrew Scheer is saying. And, again, I have to disagree with you, because if you look at the role the associations are playing, the role ... the journalists are playing, they're there to ask the tough questions — just exactly like what you're doing.

And also, this proves my point that we need that type of journalism of tough questions. And maybe the Conservatives, they don't want to hear those questions, but I think they're absolutely necessary in our democracy. So that's why the panel is in place. That's why we're moving forward.

But you've asked this panel to help decide who is a proper journalist and what's a proper news outlet and who is worthy of these funds. And who you've put on the panel that gets to decide that an organization that has a very, very strong, very partisan political statement.

But you keep repeating the same thing.

Because I'm not getting a very good answer from you.

I am answering your question and I'm saying that it's a panel with different people there from different sides of the industry, all representing professional journalists.

I guess what I'm trying to get to ... is that you want people to trust this fund, and Canadians want journalism they can trust. They want to believe that it's unbiased. But if the critics of your fund have always raised the alarm about any possible bias, that's why you wanted to have an independent panel. But haven't you just walked into that trap?

No, these panels represent people from all sides of industry. It represents work as a journalist, it represents the owners, it represents francophones, anglophones, the different regions, the ethnic media. It represents everybody.

And you don't think that there is a bias here, or a perception of bias, if you have as one of your panel members — and I know I'm asking you this once again, and I apologize for that, but I still haven't got a clear answer — do you not think that this is a problem of bias?

But I did answer your question.

You don't think that there's any bias on the part of Unifor, that Unifor doesn't have a political agenda?

No, you're saying that the journalists they represent have their own agenda.

No, no, I'm not saying that.

Yes, you're saying that.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm not. The panel you put together has Unifor as one of its members. And the question is that an organization that is clearly partisan and anti-Conservative, and have made that very clear, we're asking if that's an appropriate party to have on this panel?

We're saying that we need people from all walks of life. In this case ... people that represent the workers, the employers, the regions, the official languages and all of that to be represented there to make sure that this panel represents all of them, and that it takes neutral decisions on professional journalism.

Because we need professional journalism in our society. You're there to ask the tough questions. Again, that's exactly what you're doing and this is what we need.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/transmountain-pipeline-environment-question-1.5147454,BC takes Alberta to court because Alberta wants to regulate what goes through the pipeline. Also BC: wants to regulate what goes through the pipeline.,23.0,27.0,"B.C.'s Court of Appeal will decide Friday whether the province can change its environmental laws in a way that could effectively kill the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.

The province's top court was asked to weigh in on proposed amendments to B.C.'s Environmental Management Act forcing anyone wanting to transport increased quantities of ""heavy oil"" to seek provincial permission.

While B.C.'s attorney general argues the government has the right to enact laws aimed at protecting British Columbians from the effects of a catastrophic spill, Ottawa claims the move is a ruse designed with just one target in mind: the proposed twinning of a 1,150 pipeline to move bitumen from Edmonton to the West Coast.

The case revolves around weighty legal and constitutional issues, but it boils down to a few fundamental questions about the role of government in the lives of Canadians — and the balance between local and national interests.

In his opening arguments, Joseph Arvay, counsel for B.C., pointed to the array of lawyers for ""pipelines and railways and others in the oil and gas industry"" who had lined up to oppose him.

He claimed their arguments all boiled down to one thing:

""That even if the pipelines or railways they own or operate create a risk of even catastrophic environmental harm because of the substance they carry, the province is nevertheless powerless to enact laws to prevent that risk from materializing,"" Arvay told the five appeal court judges.

""We say that the province is not required to accept such a fate.""

'A Trojan horse'

The appeal court battle is the latest in a series of legal and political hurdles the pipeline expansion has faced since then-owner Kinder Morgan first lodged its plans with the National Energy Board (NEB) in 2013.

Last year, the federal government announced plans to buy the $4.5 billion pipeline from Kinder Morgan shareholders, who expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the approval process.

The Federal Court of Appeal put the project on hold in 2018 after finding that the government had not adequately consulted with First Nations and the NEB had failed to fully consider impacts on marine life.

Ottawa has since moved to rectify those shortcomings.

The reference question was debated over five days in March. It's one of the rare proceedings B.C.'s appeal court has decided to webcast.

Jan Brongers, lawyer for Canada's attorney general, acknowledged the ""superficial attraction"" of Arvay's argument. But he warned the judges against falling for it.

""Our main concern is that this legislation appears to be a Trojan horse,"" he said.

""It's one that's designed to appear as constitutionally acceptable local environmental protection measures, but in substance it's an unconstitutional initiative whose only logical reason for being is to limit federally regulated pipelines and railways from moving additional quantities of heavy oil.""

The court has been asked to consider three basic questions:

Does B.C. have the authority to enact the proposed amendments?

Would those rules apply to ""heavy oil"" from another province?

Would existing federal legislation trump the provincial rules in any event?

The federal government argued that it has exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines and railways, and that B.C.'s legislation is simply a bid to kill a project the provincial NDP government vigorously opposes.

But Arvay claimed B.C. isn't trying to usurp Ottawa's power — that instead the proposed amendments would work in tandem with federal laws to ensure locals are protected from the risks of projects in their backyards.

""Decisions affecting individuals should as far as reasonably possible be made by the level of government closest to the individuals affected,"" he told the court.

Strange bedfellows

A host of intervenors have lined up on either side of the debate, with the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby supporting British Columbia along with the Assembly of First Nations.

""Local governments and First Nations governments are on the front lines of emergency response for their communities,"" the City of Vancouver said in its written arguments.

""It is these communities that are at risk from a heavy oil accident and who will suffer the impacts.""

Several individual First Nations have also aligned themselves with the government of Canada, along with a number of oil and gas industry groups and the attorneys general of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Alberta said the provinces and Ottawa should work together to protect the environment, but B.C. can't take unilateral steps that would result in the obstruction or delay of the project.

Regardless of what the appeal court decides, the ultimate decision on the law is likely to rest with the Supreme Court of Canada."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/waste-recyclables-malaysia-philippines-cbc-explains-1.5153399,"Exactly. It is Reduce, Reuse and Recycle - in that exact order. Recycling was never meant to be the end goal, it was to be what we did when we couldn't reduce or reuse. But we've not reduced, and we don't reuse anything anymore (our disposable society), and recycling is showing its not up to the task of replacing the first two Rs.",9.0,134.0,"For the second time in five weeks, an angry government in Asia is demanding Canada take back unwanted waste.

First it was the Philippines — now Malaysia .

Many Canadians have been surprised — and unhappy — to learn that Canada sends vast amounts of its recyclable waste overseas.

They've been dutifully putting their plastic, glass and paper into the blue bin, believing they are doing the right thing for the environment. But the recycling process can be complicated, and the outcome isn't always as green as we might think.

What happens to what I put in the blue bin?

According to Myra Hird of the School of Environmental Studies at Queen's University, we don't really know.

""People think that when they put something in their recycling bin, it's actually going to be recycled. But this is not the case.""

She said the waste might be recycled, but everything depends on market value. (More on that later.)

You may be tossing your recyclables into a blue bin supplied by a municipal recycling program, but the municipal government's responsibility ends once the blue bin contents are sold to a recycling company. Waste and recycling is for the most part handled by private industry in Canada.

Canadian recycling companies take the material from municipal programs and sort it, clean it and compress it into smaller cubes. Those cubes are then put up for auction.

""[Municipalities] are only responsible for that first contract,"" said Hird. They need to know where the recycling and the waste first goes. After that, they're not responsible for knowing the rest of that chain.""

Recycling is a ritual in a lot of Canadian homes, and we do it with the best intentions. But intentions in our kitchens may not be good enough. Media ID: 2:20

Who buys it?

It might be bought by a Canadian company that will further process it into pellets that are sold to the plastics industry to be used in new products — such as pipes or plastic bags.

But it could also be bought by a recycling broker who will sell it again — often to companies overseas who seek to make a profit from it. All perfectly legal. But, said Hird, hard to follow.

""These brokers mean that these contracts can change hands several times between the source and the destination."" And, she said, there is no accountability.

For years, China was a huge market for the developed world's plastic waste, taking in about 45 per cent of the world's plastics waste since 1992 . But last year, China announced it no longer wants it. Canada, and other countries, needed to find new markets.

How is Canadian plastic waste ending up in Asian countries?

""We don't like to keep our waste around,"" said Hird, ""so we move it between regions. We transport waste to the United States, to South Korea, to obviously, Malaysia, the Philippines and elsewhere.""

And while companies in those countries may be willing to buy it, governments in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam started to crack down late last year — imposing bans and stricter regulations.

Malaysia's environment minister opened a container of contaminated Canadian plastic scrap at Port Klang. The country says it will send the unwanted waste back. (Eric Szeto/CBC)

Companies buy recyclable waste, because they can make money on it. This is where market value comes in. But recycling, said Hird, is not a stable industry.

""Something that we put in the recycling bin in January … that may get recycled if there's value in it, if there's a market in it."" But if there's no market, she said, then by November or December, that same material might be put in landfill because there's no longer a significant profit to be made.

What's more, said Martin Vogt, president of Ontario-based company EFS-plastics, overseas companies do not always recycle all of what we send. ""They're picking out the good plastics, and that plastic will be recycled. But most of it ends up in the oceans, in landfills … and sometimes it's burned.""

How much does Canada recycle itself?

Much less than you might think.

""Canada recycles only nine per cent of the plastic that we use here in this country,"" according to Keith Brooks of Environment Defence.

And Hird cautions that Canadians are not made aware of the costs of recycling. ""Recycling means changing that material, which often involves significant transportation.""

She uses an example of polystyrene — a standard, versatile foam plastic used to make everything from food containers to protective packaging — that is collected in Kingston.

""[It] gets shipped to northern Ontario using trucks that use non-renewable fossil fuels. It's then liquefied and made smaller, more compact, and then it's put on more trucks which are then taken to Montreal, which then are put on ships that go to the United States and go to South Korea. All of this for one more use for that polystyrene.""

So is recycling in Canada working?

According to Brooks, not really.

""We need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use. That means banning some plastic [by] the government. We need to hold producers responsible for this plastic ultimately — that's a really important thing. And we need government to take action to do that.

In British Columbia, legislation shifted the onus of handling recycling onto the businesses that create the waste, something known as ""extended producer responsibility."" Recycle B.C, a non-profit, took responsibility for the province's waste recycling about five years ago.

People who choose to leave the country choose to return as well. They are accepting the laws of the country by doing so. 100% of the people who commit offenses in foreign countries have, by definition, left the country first. If they did not want to be bound by Canada's laws, all they had to do was fail to return and renounce their citizenship. 

&gt; again, if you think it's ok for canada to punish people for breaking canada's laws while visiting other countries, then you must also be ok with saudi arabia punishing it's citizens for breaking saudi laws while visiting other countries. it's that simple. 

You keep trying to foist this argument on me as if you think it's somehow conclusive. It is not. I absolutely do not have to care what the laws are in some hellhole religious monarchy. I can criticize Saudi Arabia for the content of it's laws, just as I can with Canada's. 

If Saudi Arabia wants to punish one of its citizens for the sexual exploitation of a child in a foreign country or for bribing a foreign leader, I have no problem with that. I have a problem with any country that stones someone at any time, for any reason. I also have a problem with a country that punishes people for their sexual choices, when those choices involve consenting adults. 

Your argument that I must support SA's barbaric sexual laws is absurd.

&gt; go back and face your stoning. 

See, that's a non-parallel right there. I don't believe that Canada extradites it's own citizens back from foreign countries with the intention of punishing them for crimes they've committed over there. If you have an example of this, I'd love to see it. 

When you choose to be in this country (as anyone who chooses to leave it does, when they return) you accept its laws. You can certainly advocate for changing them to suit your desires and beliefs, but by virtue of living here you are explicitly accepting the laws of this country. 

This is even simpler in the case of SNC-Lavalin. The corporation never left this country, they just directed their agents from Canada, to break Canadian law. Where those agents were when they broke that law is immaterial (it could have been when they were hosting Ghaddaffi's asshole son over here, for example). The operating mind of the corporation, as well as its legal registration and corporate structure chose to remain here. So it chose to remain subject to Canada's laws. 

With SNC's close ties to Lybia, it certainly could have relocated there if it preferred that regulatory environment. I wonder why it chose not to?",2.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

SNC case in a nutshell",1.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

Incompetent yes, but not knowingly corrupt.",3.0,197.0,"Former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott will seek re-election as Independent candidates in the fall election campaign, having rejected an offer to join the Green Party after weeks of talks with leader Elizabeth May.

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

It has been one of the greatest honours of my life serving as the Member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville. Today I announced I will be seeking re-election as an Independent candidate in the 2019 federal election.

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

Yay! So we went from a definitive ""result"" to ""one of the various reasons"". Think we can go farther? 

&gt;The Muslims armies and christians armies fought in Spain from the 8th-15th century in the reconquista. 

A huge length of time as you know, because it was not a constant campaign. As I said Muslim armies fought in Spain proper hundreds of years before the first crusade was called, and a long time after they ended, so why now? Also interestingly not mentioned at all in Pope Urban II's speech as to why the First Crusade was needed.

&gt;The Arab armies continuously tried to conquer the Byzantine Empire from the 7th-11th century.

Protecting the Byzantines, definitely mentioned in Pope Urban's speech, yep. 

Oh wait, the Fourth Crusade, where crusaders literally sacked Christian Constantinople, treating it worse than the Muslims ever did when they took the city themselves in 1453. Kind of puts more than a huge hole in that theory. 

&gt;The Arabs also took over North Africa in the 7th century and immedy started piracy in the Mediterranean, disrupting old trade routes in Europe and raiding for slaves. The Ottoman Empire waged war against various European nations starting from the 13th century until the wars of independence in the Balkans in the lead up to WW1.

I had NO idea the Crusades lasted until WW1!!

Seriously, the Ottomans came to actual power wayyy after the crusades had ended. Their aggressions had absolutely nothing to do with Christian conquests in the Middle East unless the crusaders had time travel. 

Muslim raiders disrupting trade begining in the *8*th century, with payback 300 years later, is curious. 

What is mentioned by the Pope is Muslims acosting pilgrims and Christians in the Holy Land, something historians have found no evidence of, and seeing as how medieval rumors were terribly inaccurate, probably a lie. 

What we do have is Pope Urban's private letters, where he talks about mercenaries ravaging Europe, and the need to keep them busy against a common enemy. I brought up the Rhineland Massacres because of the political implications - lords using the crusades as an excuse to kill peope to whom they owed debts. Its thus not surprising the leaders of the Crusades, the insanely aggressive Normans, pulled out of the push towards Jerusalem the moment they conquered a major city and got some money. 

The Christian Holy War theory holds no water and is only used by people with modern political agendas.",0.0,165.0,"A lawyer representing a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after she spent eight years on death row in Pakistan says she has arrived in Canada.

Pakistani officials and others involved in the case said Wednesday that Asia Bibi had left Pakistan to be reunited with her daughters in Canada, where they had been granted asylum. Her lawyer, Saif-ul Malook, said she had already arrived in Canada.

Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2009 after a quarrel with a fellow farmworker. Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction last year and she had been in protective custody since then.

Islamic extremists have rioted over the case and threatened to kill her. The same radical Islamists, many of whom have been jailed for their threats, also urged the overthrow of the government following Bibi's acquittal.

Wilson Chawdhry of the British Pakistani Christian Association told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he received a text message from a British diplomat saying ""Asia is out."" A close friend of Bibi also confirmed that she had left the country, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

A statement from the association says it received confirmation around 8 p.m. ET Tuesday that Bibi ""had safely exited Pakistan.""

""Asia Bibi bravely held on to her faith through the most brutal of incarcerations that involved her having access to sunlight for two hours per month,"" the statement says. ""Now she finally travels to Canada to be reunited with her children.""

Chowdhry said in the statement released by the association that Bibi is ""unwell"" after suffering a decade of isolation both in and out of captivity.

""She must be treated with utmost care and receive appropriate medical care now she is free,"" he said.

Officials at Pakistan's interior and foreign ministries also confirmed her departure, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would not discuss the case Wednesday.

""I have no comment,"" Trudeau said. ""Obviously, there are sensitive privacy issues and security issues on this and unfortunately I can't comment at this time.""

Global Affairs Canada said Wednesday it ""has no comment on this matter."" Trudeau said last November that Canada was then in talks with the Pakistani government about Bibi.

The friend, who last spoke to her on Tuesday, said Bibi and her husband Ashiq Masih had spent the last several weeks getting their documents in order. He said she was longing to see her daughters, with whom she talked almost daily from her secure location, protected by Pakistani security forces.

Chawdhry said he had been in regular contact with Bibi's husband throughout the ordeal as well as with several diplomats involved in international efforts to get her to safety.

The case has brought international attention to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, which carries an automatic death penalty. The mere suspicion of blasphemy against Islam is enough to ignite mob lynchings in the country. The accusation of blasphemy has also been used to intimidate religious minorities and to settle scores.

Radical Islamists have made the punishment of blasphemy a major rallying cry, bringing tens of thousands into the streets and paralyzing major cities.

Students from a religious seminary shout slogans as they demand punishment for Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy, during a rally in Karachi on Nov. 26, 2010. Bibi has long maintained she was wrongly implicated in the case. (Athar Hussain/Reuters)

Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, has been celebrated as a martyr by hardliners since he was hanged for the killing, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Pakistan's minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated later that year after demanding justice for Bibi.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed not to be intimidated by the rioters, saying the rule of law would decide Bibi's fate. But she was denied permission to leave the country for several months until sentiments cooled.

A three-judge Supreme Court panel in January cleared Bibi's final legal hurdle when they ruled there was no compelling reason to overturn the court's earlier acquittal. The judges accused those who charged Bibi with blasphemy of committing perjury, but said they would not be tried because of the sensitivity of the case. The judges upheld the blasphemy law."

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

Premier Bob McLeod is laying out a vision for the North's future that includes an increased military presence and major development of Arctic waters for transportation.

""We need to position Canada's North as a central international transport hub for the future of the Arctic and we see significant more infrastructure investment required,"" McLeod said in a recent interview with CBC Politics in Ottawa.

McLeod said he'll be presenting this and other ideas to the federal government in Ottawa within the next month.

The premier wants Canada to triple its icebreaker fleet within five years and triple its deepwater port capacity within 10 years.

""I think that you see other Arctic countries becoming significant players in the Arctic and we need to be sure that Canada and the North is ready for when that happens,"" McLeod said.

Both China and Russia have shown growing interest in the Arctic. The Barents Observer of Norway reported in February that Russia plans to use supersonic jet fighters to make regular patrols of the North Pole, something Russia hasn't done since the Cold War.

McLeod said Inuvik, located 100 kilometres from the Beaufort Sea, should play a key security role.

""We'd like to see a full military base, preferably in Inuvik, of about 5,000 permanent personnel,"" he said.

While the federal government announced last fall that Yellowknife will be home to a new Arctic Region Coast Guard base, McLeod said there should be a base in the Beaufort Sea.

Officials from all three northern territories are meeting in Yellowknife on Wednesday. The Arctic Security Working Group will discuss safety, security and defence issues, along with the commander of the Canadian Forces' Joint Task Force North.

It's unknown whether McLeod's vision of a more militarized North will be part of the federal government's much-anticipated Arctic Policy Framework, which may be released as early as June.

The new Arctic policy initiative was announced in December 2016 to replace the 2009 Northern Strategy and the 2010 Statement on Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy under Stephen Harper's Conservative government.

The current federal government recently added foreign affairs and national security, as well as reconciliation, to the list of themes the new policy will address.

""We've been working with the government of Canada on a 10-year vision and plan for Arctic Canada and I've been going to a lot of Arctic conferences and realizing that Canada is falling way far behind the other Arctic countries,"" McLeod said.

""So we're coming up with a plan where the Arctic will become a critical international arena of economics, science and infrastructure and environment strategy.""

Icebreaker U

In order to increase understanding of the Arctic, McLeod envisions a Canada-wide civil service rotation program in which senior bureaucrats from the South spend time living in the North. He'd also like to see a federal department of Arctic affairs and a northern immigration program.

""We think that we need more immigration and the fact is we don't have enough people up here. We're also looking at having a permanent offshore Arctic university school on one of the existing icebreakers,"" he said.

McLeod said he takes climate change and Arctic ecology ""very, very seriously."" His vision for the N.W.T., however, remains steeped in fostering transportation corridors and pipelines to accommodate the oil and gas industry.

McLeod says innovation is needed to find alternate energy sources for 20 diesel-dependent communities beyond solar and wind, given that neither of those can supply continuous, year-round power to communities.

McLeod has been premier of the N.W.T. since 2011. He is the MLA for the riding of Yellowknife South. The next territorial election is Oct. 1."

She thought the U.S. Border Patrol would want to search her car. That she would be bombarded with questions. That they would demand she show her prescription for insulin.

Worst of all, she was worried they would confiscate the small, cold vials of a life-saving drug that she had crossed the border to buy at a pharmacy in Fort Frances, Ont.

But it didn't happen. Not for Nystrom, not for anyone in her small group from Minnesota — calling themselves the Caravan to Canada — who were on a mission last weekend to buy insulin at one-tenth the price of what it's listed in the United States.

As the cost of insulin continues to skyrocket in the U.S., where pharmaceutical companies can dictate the price, people are making the trek north as an alternative to paying thousands of dollars to stay alive.

The small group drove five hours from Minnesota to Ontario to buy insulin at one-tenth the cost. (Rachel Nystrom)

Insulin and many other drugs cost less in Canada, thanks to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, a federal agency that establishes the maximum price that can be charged for patented drugs.

So while an influx of Americans crossing the border to buy insulin won't affect the price, it could hurt supply in Canada.

""There absolutely is some degree of risk,"" said Barry Power, director of therapeutic content with the Canadian Pharmacists Association.

""If you look at the disparity in the populations, a small percentage of Americans coming to Canada is a disproportionate increase for services and supplies that are earmarked for Canada.""

For Americans, it's hardly a long-term solution. For some, it's the only option.

And for others, it's already too late.

Nicole Smith-Holt, also from Minnesota, joined last weekend's Caravan to Canada. Her son, Alec Smith, died in June 2017 from diabetes complications. She said he had been rationing his insulin when he couldn't afford to buy more.

""Mine was a symbolic fight, and going to see how easy and accessible and affordable it is at a pharmacy in Canada,"" she said. ""If I had known about this in 2017, I would have made that trip in 2017 and been able to save his life.""

'Desperate measures'

Nystrom, who has Type 1 diabetes, requires insulin to stay alive. She is on a type of fast-acting insulin called NovoLog, which costs about $300 US a vial. The Canadian equivalent, NovoRapid, is about $30 per vial. She was shocked to learn about the price difference.

""I almost felt walking out of that pharmacy like I was robbing the pharmacy. I just couldn't believe it,"" she said.

But border towns across Canada have seen Americans coming to buy medication for years.

The Guardian Johnson Drug Store in Perth-Andover, N.B., sits just shy of seven kilometres east of the U.S. border. Pharmacist Jill MacIntosh said the store has about 10 patients who come regularly from the U.S.

""We see probably at least one person a week,"" she said.

Dr. Seema Nagpal, vice-president of science and policy with Diabetes Canada, said her organization is paying attention to the cross-border traffic and potential insulin shortfalls.

""We try to keep our ear to the ground and hear as early as we can if that is becoming a problem, but we just haven't heard that yet.""

Nagpal said there are major health risks for people who can't afford to pay for their insulin.

""When a person doesn't have access to treatment that they need in order to sustain their life and to have a future, absolutely I understand there would be desperate measures in order to maintain their health,"" she said.

But she said Canadians also struggle to pay for their insulin.

""Many people are forced to make choices about whether they pay rent, whether they put certain foods on the table versus filling their prescriptions,"" she said, adding Diabetes Canada hears about insulin rationing in Canada, as well.

Pharmacists in both Canada and the U.S. say Americans coming north for cheaper insulin isn't a solution to the problem. (Reed Saxon/The Associated Press)

How long a vial of insulin lasts depends on how much a person takes. It could be anywhere from a week to a month.

Right now, insulin isn't available as a generic drug in the U.S., because pharmaceutical companies have made small improvements to insulin over the years to keep it under patent.

Nystrom has health insurance in Minnesota through the Affordable Care Act. But she's on what she calls a high-deductible plan: She pays $370 US a month for the plan itself, but has to pay a $7,800 US deductible before her plan will cover her insulin.

But not everyone in the U.S. has insurance, or is able to get it.

Smith-Holt said before her son died, he had just turned 26, which meant he was no longer eligible to stay on her insurance plan as of June 1, 2017.

On June 22, he went to the pharmacy to get more insulin. He was told it would cost $1,300 US. His body was found June 27.

""We are assuming he was hoping that what he had left he could stretch until payday,"" Smith-Holt said. ""He was just three days short of that payday when he passed away.""

High cost of insurance

While there are programs that exist for people over 65 or low-income families, the only other options in the U.S. are coverage through work or to buy it out of pocket.

Lija Greenseid, who organized the Caravan to Canada, lives in St. Paul, Minn. Her 13-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes and she and her husband buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

Last year, she said they spent $13,000 US just to obtain health insurance — and then $14,000 US out of pocket before her daughter's insulin was covered.

""It's a huge amount of money for us. Because of that, we didn't put any money into our kids' college savings accounts or put anything into retirement for the year. We really just had to pay our health-care bills,"" Greenseid said.

""So now you can see why we do crazy things like go across the border and buy insulin.""

Quinn Nystrom holds the insulin she bought on her trip to Canada. (Submitted by Quinn Nystrom)

Their fears around crossing the border come from confusion and uncertainty about what's allowed to be brought back into the U.S.

The U.S. Border Patrol declined to answer questions directly and referred CBC News to its website and to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The Border Patrol website says Americans travelling with prescription medication should have it in its original containers, have a copy of the prescription on hand and carry only personal-use quantities, which is a 90-day supply. It was unclear whether the same rules apply to medication bought outside the country.

The FDA did not reply by deadline for this story.

Len Saunders, an immigration lawyer in Blaine, Wash., on the border with Surrey, B.C., said he's never seen issues with bringing back medication as long as it's not a controlled substance.

""I don't think Americans care about people bringing insulin back to the U.S.,"" he said.

'They're a national embarrassment'

But crossing the border isn't an option for everyone.

""I don't think it's a long-term solution. And I also think it's sort of a cop-out for the U.S. government,"" Nystrom said.

""They want to say what a sophisticated country they are, how advanced they are, how they're one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and to me they're a national embarrassment and they are not taking care of their citizens.""

In February, the American Pharmacists Association and the Canadian Pharmacists Association issued a joint statement warning that drug importation policies could put patients at risk.

Power, with the Canadian association, said they wanted to highlight that crossing the border to get ""cheaper drugs"" from Canada is not a solution to problems in the U.S.

""They need to work on addressing the root causes that are causing the price disparities and making Americans take extreme measures to go outside the country to get their medication,"" he said.

Dr. LaShawn McIver agrees. The senior vice-president of government affairs and advocacy with the American Diabetes Association said 39 per cent of Americans saw the cost of their insulin increase in the last year.

""If people are travelling to other countries because they can't afford their insulin, then that's a problem,"" said McIver.

She said the U.S. federal health agency is looking at importing lower-cost drugs from other countries. But the American Diabetes Association wants to see changes at home so that insulin is more affordable.

She said the association is working with Congress to find solutions, and is calling for price transparency laws.

While everyone agrees crossing the border isn't a sustainable option, it's likely to continue.

Nystrom said she knows of a group from Michigan that drove up to Canada on Thursday. She's planning another trip in June.

Greenseid wants to rally state politicians in Minnesota to sponsor a bus to bring people to Canada to buy insulin.

""As a mom, I do this lovingly for my child, but I really want to work for change so that it's easier for her when she gets older,"" Greenseid said. ""Because it's just too expensive.""

The company has said it's undertaking a major restructuring, and on Monday said that it will have trimmed thousands of jobs by August.

The company said the plan will save about $600 million US per year by eliminating bureaucracy and increasing the number of workers reporting to each manager.

In the U.S., about 2,300 jobs will be cut through buyouts and layoffs. About 1,500 already have happened, and some 500 workers will be let go in the U.S. and Canada this week. A final 300 will be cut in the U.S. and Canada by August, a spokesperson for Ford Canada told the CBC in an email Monday.

In a memo to employees, Monday, CEO Jim Hackett said the fourth wave of the restructuring will start on Tuesday, with the majority of cuts being finished by May 24.

To succeed in our competitive industry, and position Ford to win in a fast-changing future, we must reduce bureaucracy…and cut costs. - Jim Hackett, Ford CEO

""To succeed in our competitive industry, and position Ford to win in a fast-changing future, we must reduce bureaucracy, empower managers, speed decision making and focus on the most valuable work, and cost cuts,"" Hackett wrote.

In the U.S., about 1,500 white-collar employees have left the company voluntarily since the restructuring began last year, some taking buyouts. About 300 have been laid off already, with another 500 layoffs starting this week.

Most of Ford's white-collar workers are in and around the company's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters.

2nd recent set of layoffs

It's the second set of layoffs for Detroit-area automakers, even though the companies are making healthy profits. Sales in the U.S., where the automakers get most of their revenue, have fallen slightly but still are strong.

In November, General Motors announced it would shed up to 14,000 workers as it cut expenses to prepare for a shift to electric and autonomous vehicles.

The layoffs included closure of five factories in the U.S. and Canada and cuts of another 8,000 white-collar workers worldwide. About 5,000 blue-collar positions were cut, but most of laid-off factory workers in the U.S. will be placed at other plants mainly that build trucks and SUVs.

Both companies have said the cuts are needed to prepare for the future, because companies face huge capital expenditures to update their current vehicles and develop them for the future.

The cuts brought withering criticism of GM from U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress, especially the closing of a small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio. Trump campaigned on bringing factory jobs back to the industrial Midwest. GM has since announced a possible deal to sell the Lordstown plant to a startup electric vehicle maker, but it hasn't been finalized.

Hackett said in the memo that Ford is departing from past practices and letting laid-off employees stay a few days to wrap up their jobs and say good-bye to colleagues. In the past, laid-off workers would have had to pack up and leave immediately.

""Ford is a family company and saying goodbye to colleagues is difficult and emotional,"" Hackett wrote.

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says a gun smuggling 'pipeline' moves firearms across the border from the U.S. into Canada illegally. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Wes Winkel, is the owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to pick out a possible straw buyer, and law enforcement authorities have been slow to identify them based on sales records. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

That's how Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research, sees the Newfoundland and Labrador provincial election after a poll conducted among 856 potential voters was released on Thursday.

Among decided or leaning voters polled, 42 per cent support the Progressive Conservatives, while the Liberals hold 40 per cent, the New Democrats are at 13 per cent, and six per cent selected ""other"" options.

A few seats for the third party could mean the difference between a majority and a minority. - Lorne Bozinoff

The difference between the two leading parties is within the margin of error — plus or minus three per cent, 19 times out of 20 — meaning it's too close to confidently say one party is leading over the other.

The poll did not account for undecided voters. When asked why, Bozinoff told The St. John's Morning Show it didn't matter.

""We take them out because we believe at the end of the day, most of the undecideds will vote the way everyone else will vote. They'll break basically in the same proportions, or they won't vote.""

Of the 856 respondents, only 79 said they were undecided, leaving 91 per cent of people decided or leaning.

Based on the 777 respondents counted in the results, Forum Research estimates the PCs will win 19 seats, the Liberals 18 and the NDP three.

""What will be fascinating to watch is how the NDP will factor into the final results,"" Bozinoff said. ""Even just a few seats for the third party could mean the difference between a majority and a minority government.""

This is the third poll released in Newfoundland and Labrador this week, with each showing different results.

Abacus Data had the PCs five percentage points higher than the Liberals among decided voters, while MQO suggested the Liberals had a 12-point lead over the PCs — again, among decided voters.

Forum Research was the only group of pollsters to accurately predict the PC party was leading in the recent Prince Edward Island election.

Trouble for Liberals in central

The polling suggests the strongest support for the PCs is in ""central Newfoundland and Grand Falls-Windsor,"" where most districts are currently red.

Forum Research says 48 per cent of respondents in the region support the PC party, whereas support for the Liberals is at 37 per cent.

The west coast of Newfoundland shows the strongest support for the Liberals, with 45 per cent of respondents saying they'd vote red.

More than half dissatisfied with all leaders

While the numbers for party support is close, the number of people disapproving of all three party leaders is even closer.

""None of them did that well,"" Bozinoff said.

The poll suggested 63 per cent of respondents disapprove of the job Dwight Ball has done as premier, while 37 per cent support him.

For Ches Crosbie, 55 per cent of people disapprove of his abilities to lead the Progressive Conservative party, while 45 per cent approve.

Leaders Alison Coffin, Dwight Ball and Ches Crosbie are vying for the top job in the province. (CBC)

For the NDP, 52 per cent disapprove of Alison Coffin's job as leader, while 48 per cent approve.

About 40 per cent of respondents didn't think there was a winner at the leader's debate broadcast by CBC and NTV on May 1.

When asked if they thought Newfoundland and Labrador was better or worse off than it was four years ago, 66 per cent said worse, with 42 per cent saying ""much worse.""

Premium (no ethanol) + stabilizer lasts pretty good -- I would think most people take a road trip out of the battery range of a plug-in hybrid at least once a year?",1.0,51.0,"The cars pass almost silently, but you see hundreds of them on the streets. Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Slim selection

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

The reduction includes a $28 million cut to the $1.5 billion the province gives 49 children’s aid societies in Ontario, increasing concerns about the ability of agencies to serve and protect vulnerable children. The cut comes as 18 child protection agencies struggle with deficits totalling more than $12 million.

The deficits have already forced some agencies to lay off staff and reduce the number of children at risk they take into care.

“A decrease in children in care does not mean there are fewer children in need of protection,” the OACAS warned in a PowerPoint produced in late March, outlining its core messages before the provincial budget was tabled.

The association’s post-budget analysis suggests their warning may not have been heard.

The $84.5 million cut for youth at risk is contained in a May 16 “briefing note” the OACAS sent to top CAS officials, and obtained by the Star. The calculations are based on the government’s operating and capital spending estimates tabled in the legislature May 9.

Anti-poverty advocates shaken by cuts contemplated by Ford government

Opinion | Martin Regg Cohn: Secret document shows how far Doug Ford’s Tories would cut social services — until they were talked back from the brink

The OACAS calculated funding envelopes that fall under the budget line of “child and youth at risk,” including services for child protection and youth involved with the justice system.

The association is uncertain about the full impact of the cuts. Some funding envelopes have been eliminated and new ones created. It’s unclear if programs funded under the eliminated envelopes will continue to be funded under the new ones. Some of the cuts may involve the closing of unused facilities or resources, particularly in the area of youth justice. But when all the pluses and minuses are calculated, the funding shortfall is $84.5 million, according to the OACAS.

“We are concerned about the impact of any potential cuts to our members and to the families that they serve,” Nicole Bonnie, chief executive officer of the OACAS said in an email response to questions.

“At this time we do not have details as to which programs will be funded or who will deliver them,” Bonnie added. “We are waiting for more detailed information from the ministry to understand the exact nature of the impact on child welfare.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Bonnie hopes to soon meet with Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. “Our message is and always has been that the children and families we serve are the most marginalized and disenfranchised, and programs that support their well-being need to be fully funded.”

The minister’s office did not respond to direct questions about the cuts. In an emailed statement, MacLeod’s press secretary, Derek Rowland, described the well-being of vulnerable young people as the government’s “utmost priority.” The steady decline of children being taken into care since 2006, he added, has helped most children’s aid societies balance their budgets and the ministry is working with those that haven’t.

“We will be holding Ontario’s Children’s Aid Societies and other providers to higher standards to keep our kids safe,” Rowland said, denouncing what he described as “the lack of oversight and relaxed regulation” of the previous Liberal government.

Rowland said the government is increasing investments in prevention programs “to ensure kids keep out of trouble.” The government also “expects significant savings” in the youth justice sector after a review found “underutilized detention facilities.”

A plan to reduce the number of children’s aid societies through amalgamation is also being considered by the ministry.

What isn’t in doubt is that children’s aid societies will have less core funding to work with.

One children’s aid society, Brant Family and Children’s Services, has struggled with deficits that forced the layoff of 26 workers in March, in a community facing perhaps the worst opioid addiction epidemic in the province. Its executive director then posted a letter to the Brantford area community on the agency’s website, warning of serious consequences.

“When governments cut child welfare services (managers, front-line staff, and support services), children ultimately die or are allowed by society to live in unbearable, violent and neglectful conditions,” Andy Koster wrote.

“With higher caseloads and tight timelines, workers are forced to move from one crisis to another instead of planning and working proactively with families to prevent future incidents,” he added. “Despite best efforts, children fall through the cracks and suffer the consequences of insufficient resources.”

The cuts for children at risk also comes on the heels of the government eliminating the office that advocated for children and youth.

Kiaras Gharabaghi, director of Ryerson University’s School of Child and Youth Care, denounced the cuts as implemented without consultations.

“They are cuts that have no interest in making the system work better for kids and families,” he said in an interview after reviewing the OACAS document.

“This sector requires a different approach,” Gharabaghi added. “It’s one where young people die by violence, by suicide, by neglect. It’s not the same as increasing class sizes in schools to save some money.”

The Zero-Emission Vehicles Act (ZEVA), passed on Wednesday, sets a target of 10 per cent of all new light-duty cars and trucks sold in B.C. to be zero emission by 2025. By 2040, they'll all need to be emission free.

Zero emission vehicles include battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.

For Clean Energy Canada policy director Dan Woynillowicz, the new law is a welcome tool to make sure consumers can actually find the cars they're looking for.

""This is going to go a long way toward addressing a problem we've had in British Columbia, which is we have more British Columbians interested in buying electric cars than we have electric cars on dealership lots,"" said Woynillowicz.

He said often the stock just isn't there; buyers can't take test drives and have to wait for vehicles to be ordered.

According to Woynillowicz, the targets laid out in the new act will be subject to adjustments over the next 20 years, as officials keep an eye on the demand and availability of zero emission vehicles.

Luke-warm opposition support

The opposition B.C. Liberals voted for ZEVA, but environment and climate change critic Peter Milobar said he has issues with the law, arguing it will largely prove ineffective.

Milobar said the fact that consumers can take their business to Alberta if they aren't interested in zero emission cars isn't ideal. He also said the credit system for manufacturers who can't meet the targets is a loophole.

""The government can sell credits — there's no cap on the number of credits they can create — so manufacturers would be able to access those credits, pay the government a little bit extra money and still be compliant without actually having put any extra vehicles on the road that are electric vehicles,"" he said.

Milobar suggested the focus on emissions from cars over the next 20 years won't go too far in reducing the province's overall emissions, and combustion engines are making strides in reducing emissions, so they shouldn't be outlawed.

With long-range targets, the new legislation may be subject to plenty of change before 2040 rolls around.

""None of the reference checking dates will really be relevant until after the next general election,"" said Milobar.

But now the property is slated to be flooded on purpose — and potentially often — to protect two cities 30 kilometres downstream.

The 2,500 acres he farms, located south of Fargo, N.D., and Moorhead, Minn., is in the middle of what will become a retention area for floodwater once a multibillion-dollar diversion project is constructed. A 50-kilometre channel will usher overflow from the Red River around the flood-prone Fargo-Moorhead area.

""It puts us in a tough situation,"" said Ness. ""A lot of unknowns as far as how it's going to affect us, our neighbours, the farming community.""

Fargo is the last and largest urban area in North Dakota that doesn't have permanent flood protection from the Red River. The Red, which flows north and cuts between Minnesota and North Dakota, rises every spring and has historically caused major flooding in Grand Forks, N.D., and farther downstream in Winnipeg.

Fargo has managed to avoid disaster — but just barely. The city was pushed to its flood-fighting limits in 1997, 2009 and 2011. Officials estimate damages could run upward of $18 billion if the city were to experience a catastrophic flood today.

Mark Askegaard, a sixth generation organic farmer based south of Moorhead, Minn., is part of the MnDak Upstream Coalition. The group opposes the current design for the Fargo-Moorhead flood diversion project. (Warren Kay)

For the past decade, officials have been navigating tricky regulatory, legal and political issues as they to try to build the diversion project. It's complicated given the fact the river cuts through two cities, in two different states, and requires agreement and funding from both of the cities and states, as well as the federal government.

The challenge is similar to what officials could face for any cross-jurisdictional, flood-mitigation projects in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

While the $2.75-billion Fargo-Moorhead diversion project continues to clear legislative and funding hurdles, people whose homes and property will be placed in the path of the man-made flood plain argue there has to be a better way to protect the 230,000 people who live in the metro area.

""We don't believe that it's right to start to stage water on areas of land that don't flood, to protect land that currently floods,"" said Minnesota farmer Mark Askegaard, a colleague of Ness's at the MnDak Upstream Coalition, a group that opposes the diversion plan.

'Farming is a way of life'

Construction on a section of the diversion in North Dakota started in 2017 but was halted by a legal injunction launched by Minnesota. A judge modified the injunction last month, allowing construction to resume. The project also recently secured an additional $480 million from North Dakota and the federal government.

Work is projected to take 6½ years and could resume in the next 30-90 days. If completed and operated as planned, 90 per cent of Ness's land will be at risk of flooding.

Ness is in the process of taking over the farm from his aging father. He's been holding off on moving his family to the property. Just a few months ago, his parents received notice they'd be required to sell their home to the Fargo-Moorhead Diversion Authority and move out. They would have to live elsewhere but could possibly still farm there.

""Farming is a way of life,"" Ness said. His father has lived on the farm his entire life.

""The connections to the area, the land, the farmstead. It's just tough not knowing where it's going to go from here.""

Frankly, what works in Grand Forks, or works in Winnipeg, may not work somewhere very close by. - Rocky Schneider, spokesperson for the Fargo-Moorhead Diversion Authority

The MnDak Upstream Coalition isn't convinced the diversion authority has fully accounted for all the potential impacts and problems the project will cause upstream. The group is particularly concerned about how affected families and businesses will be compensated if their properties are damaged or no longer usable.

They say the diversion authority hasn't been able to tell them how much money they would receive for not only their homes, but all of the buildings and amenities they've built on their farms.

They are also concerned for people who will have to live elsewhere but plan to continue farming their land. They say it isn't clear how compensation will work if a farmer's property is used for water retention.

For example, water retention wouldn't last the entire summer, but the debris that's left behind could potentially delay seeding. Askegaard says many farmers have contractual obligations for delivering crops, and any delays would cause major financial strain.

""I'm not arguing that Fargo doesn't need a diversion, but I think the scope of the project can be downsized. And if they do that, and they don't protect so much undeveloped flood plain, there will be fewer impacts upstream of the project and probably totally eliminate all the impacts to the state of Minnesota.""

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney says his city and the surrounding area need the diversion to keep them safe and allow for investment and growth. (Warren Kay)

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney says the diversion is essential but some people forget why the sacrifices of some are necessary.

""If you're closer to the flood, then people understand what needs to be done. As you move farther away from the flood, then it's not as personal to them,"" he said.

An hour north of Fargo, and downstream on the Red River, is Grand Forks, N.D., and East Grand Forks, Minn. — two communities where many residents know the devastation of floods first-hand and have taken action to try to prevent them permanently.

""Come quick! Downtown Grand Forks is on fire.""

That's what Jon Bonzer's sister-in-law said after he pulled into her driveway in Fargo in the spring of 1997. His family and more than 50,000 other Grand Forks and East Grand Forks residents had to flee their homes after levees failed and more than a metre of water flooded both communities.

After the evacuation, a fire broke out in downtown Grand Forks, destroying 60 apartments and 11 historic buildings, including Bonzer's pub.

""The real kick down here was watching our business burn down, on TV, from 80 miles away,"" he said. ""It was difficult.""

Weeks later, when he was finally able to return to the community, he already knew his business was gone, so he went to check on his house. He says he didn't open his eyes until he was standing on the main floor and could tell his feet weren't in water.

""I just got on my knees and said, 'Thank you,' because I was overwhelmed that I had a house that was standing. I had eight feet of water to remove from the basement, which was a monumental task, but the alternative would have been I would have lost the house as well.""

Bonzer could be considered one of the lucky ones. More than 2,500 homes and structures were demolished, moved or voluntarily bought out — some as a result of the flood damage and others to make room for permanent flood protection infrastructure.

Grand Forks city councillor Ken Vein, who worked as a city engineer during the flood in 1997, says difficult decisions had to be made and certain areas could not be redeveloped.

""We had to correct a lot of planning and the implementations from years past. We had an opportunity to do it right and that's what I think we accomplished,"" he said.

At the time, the city looked at the Winnipeg floodway as a possible option but decided it would push urban problems onto rural areas, Vein said. Officials also decided it would be too costly for a smaller city to do a project of that scale, including purchasing the necessary land, he said.

So Grand Forks decided to push neighbourhoods and development back from the river to create space for a small amount of water retention and a system of flood walls and earthen levees. Instead of those buildings along the riverbank, there are now several parks, a campground, two golf courses, three disc golf courses and more than 30 kilometres of multi-purpose trails.

Ken Vein was the city engineer for Grand Forks, N.D., during the flood in 1997. The dikes and levees behind him cost more than $400 million to build. (Warren Kay)

Back on the farm south of Fargo, Ness says he knows flooding needs to be mitigated along the Red River, he just thinks there is a better way to do it that could impact fewer people. He points to the dike system in Grand Forks as a possible example.

Rocky Schneider, spokesperson for the diversion authority, says while Grand Forks is a great example of flood mitigation, Fargo is not in a position to do the same thing.

""Frankly, what works in Grand Forks, or works in Winnipeg, may not work somewhere very close by.""

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney says despite a few remaining hurdles, the diversion project is finally on the right track.

""Right now, we're in the best position we've ever been in,"" he said.

Ness says he's holding out hope that one of those last few hurdles can change the project's course. If not, he'll have to decide whether this project puts his family out of farming forever.

""I think it would be almost next to impossible, or is impossible, to recreate this."""

Of course carbon taxing won't make a massive difference without global cooperation, but it's the best step *we* can take to change behavior and lower consumption",4.0,41.0,"Former Liberal cabinet members Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott say they will make announcements Monday about their political futures.

The two MPs, who now sit as independents in the House of Commons, were expelled from the Liberal caucus in April by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said that trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably ""broken.""

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team,"" he said.

Philpott will make the announcement at the Reesor's Farm Market in her Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville, while Wilson-Raybould will address the media in her British Columbia riding of Vancouver Granville.

The political drama between the two former Liberals and the party began unfolding Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister, had faced inappropriate political pressure to grant Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement that would see it avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges providing the company fulfilled a number of conditions.

Trudeau denied applying inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould — arguing that he let her make the final decision, which was to allow the prosecution to go forward — but he conceded that he tried to convince her to consider the implications of a conviction.

Should a court convict SNC-Lavalin, the company would be banned for 10 years from bidding on government contracts. Trudeau and others in his government argued that could put some of its 9,000 jobs at risk.

Shuffled out

Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee in February that she was shuffled out of her cabinet post when she refused to do Trudeau's bidding.

When Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, appeared before the same committee, he dismissed that allegation, insisting that ""the January cabinet shuffle had nothing whatsoever to do with SNC Lavalin.""

He said that when Scott Brison, the former president of the Treasury Board and MP for Kings Hants, approached him on Dec. 12, 2018 to say he was going to leave politics, he tried to dissuade Brison because it would require a cabinet shuffle ""and the prime minister was happy with the team he had.""

""If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today,"" Butts said. ""That is a fact, and facts are very stubborn things. Cabinet selections are among the most difficult tasks for any first minister.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately resigned from cabinet and was later followed by Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the Trudeau cabinet and could no longer sit at the table.

When Wilson-Raybould revealed she had made a secret audio recording of a conversation about the issue she had with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, several members of the Liberal caucus said they saw the act as a violation of trust.

That recording, and Philpott's statements about her loss of confidence in the government, were cited by Trudeau as reasons for dropping them from the Liberal caucus in April.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May told CBC Radio's The House earlier this month that she had spoken to both MPs and was waiting to see if either would run for the Greens in the next federal election."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-student-immunization-mandatory-education-minister-cardy-1.5155481,Make vaccines mandatory by law. Ban all guns.,-43.0,98.0,"Education Minister Dominic Cardy says any students who don't meet immunization requirements this fall won't be allowed through the school doors unless and until they do.

Cardy isn't just talking about excluding students during an outbreak like the ongoing one in the Saint John area, where 11 cases of measles have been confirmed, nine of which are linked to Kennebecasis Valley High School in Quispamsis. He means barring them from attending school entirely.

""We wouldn't let a child come to school with a gun,"" he said. ""And a child coming to school who's able to transmit easily infectious, fatal diseases is doing just that — they're bringing something dangerous into the school environment,"" he said.

""Certainly, my expectation is that starting in September every child going into a New Brunswick school be there with their vaccine cards to prove that they are not a risk to themselves or others in the school system.""

New Brunswick has a long-standing policy that requires students to either show proof they are immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), varicella (chicken pox) and meningococcal disease, or obtain an exemption for medical or parental objections.

But it hasn't been consistently enforced for years, so the province doesn't know how many unvaccinated students are in the school system.

Cardy intends to change that.

""They will be excluded from school if they are unwilling to follow the rules around health and safety,"" he said, adding he will give people ""a reasonable amount of time"" to comply once public health resources aren't stretched so thin dealing with the measles outbreak.

Personal exemption provision too broad

He also plans to ""tighten up"" the personal exemption provision of Policy 706, which he describes as too broad.

As it stands, parents can ""just say,' I don't want to have my kids vaccinated,'"" he said. ""I don't think that's good enough.

""I am unaware of any faith tradition that tells people that, you know, 'Thy children must be infected with easily preventable diseases.'

""And we also have an option in New Brunswick that if people don't want to be part of a public system, they're free to home school their kids.""

Under Policy 706, children are supposed to be immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, varicella and meningococcal disease before entering the school system. (Canadian Press)

Cardy believes the only exceptions should be for medical reasons to ensure so-called herd immunity, or community immunity.

""If we had that herd immunity, this outbreak wouldn't have happened,"" he said.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, because measles is so highly contagious and spreads so easily, either through the air or direct contact with an infected individual, at least 95 per cent of people need to be vaccinated for herd immunity to work.

""If you don't want to get yourself vaccinated or your kids vaccinated, think about the kids who are suffering from severe immunosuppression"" and can't be vaccinated, said Cardy.

Marissa Gootjes, 15, of Quispamsis, is just one of those students. She was happy to be back at Kennebecasis Valley High School after undergoing brain surgery to remove a cancerous tumour, followed by 13 months of chemotherapy, but now has to stay home because she's at risk of contracting measles.

Although some people have questioned whether mandatory immunization could violate charter rights, Cardy argued he also has a duty to protect the rights of students who are vulnerable.

""It doesn't make much sense when we spend time talking about move-over laws on highways and bike laws and helmet laws and stuff like that, if we're going to ignore the transmission of infectious, potentially fatal diseases in our schools,"" he said.

""If you're going to be in a public school system, we've got to take public health into account.""

""That's going to be the choice that parents have to make is if they want to participate in the public school system. There are rules around public health there to protect everyone in our society and those rules will be enforced."""
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-area-mom-foothills-school-division-cease-and-desist-letter-1.5122008,That’s not the point though. If you’ve got 47 grade 2s together there is going to be a lot of noise and commotion that 2 teachers are not going to be able to control. I feel sorry for the kids who are trying to learn or concentrate.,7.0,101.0,"A Calgary-area mother who spoke out to CBC News over concerns about a large combined Grade 2 class at Red Deer Lake School has been handed a cease-and-desist letter by a law firm on behalf of the school board.

The letter — served on behalf of the Foothills School Division — was written by Brownlee LLP, a large Edmonton law firm, and penned two days after CBC's original story was published.

""It's an example of trying to squash a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Gillian Colborne, one of the mothers who spoke to CBC News after pulling her son from the class over concerns he was struggling in a large room with 47 kids and two teachers.

Colborne, who has another child attending the school, says parents have been trying to get answers from the school division for months, and she was surprised to receive the three-page cease-and-desist letter.

Other parents have also received the letter and are not willing to be interviewed as a result.

""We are parents attempting to advocate for our children in a very calm open manner,"" said Colborne. ""It just seems unnecessary. I would have expected somebody to come to us and say, 'Oh, these are real and valid concerns you have. Let's sit down and talk about them.'""

Parents could be banned from school

The letter accuses parents of making false allegations in communications to various parties. It claims they've made defamatory comments, filed malicious complaints and says that they could be banned from the school. It also threatens legal action if they don't refrain from repeating or publishing their comments.

""Your advocacy has exceeded the boundaries of productive dialogue and devolved into disparaging the professional reputation of well-respected educators,"" the letter states.

It goes on to say the Foothills School Division has responded to each concern relating to their children. It accuses the parents of repeatedly pressuring school staff members through text messages, emails — as well as in person — and says several staff members claim they felt ""unduly pressured by your relentless tactics.""

""To be clear, you are to cease sending all e-mail or other correspondence that contains false or defamatory comments regarding any Foothills School Division employee to anyone. Any failure on your part to take heed of this warning may result in legal proceedings.""

The Foothills School division declined CBC's request for an interview. In a written statement, a spokesperson says: ""At times actions must be taken to ensure that third parties do not negatively impact a school environment and workplace.""

""We feel that we have fully addressed any questions surrounding the Grade 2 classroom configuration at Red Deer Lake School,"" the email states.

""We maintain that it is an effective learning environment. As we stated previously, all parents are welcome to continue to discuss with their child's teacher(s) and school administration any concerns they have about their child's learning.""

Barbara Silva with Support Our Students Alberta calls the cease-and-desist letters 'heavy-handed.' (CBC)

Letter called 'heavy-handed'

""It seems like a very heavy-handed way to shut this conversation down,"" said Barbara Silva, communications director with Support Our Students Alberta. ""Once you bring in legal counsel, it sets up a David and Goliath dynamic.""

Silva says she believes the parents' concerns about a large combined classroom are ""well-founded"" and exist around the province.

While her organization regularly hears from parents who feel their concerns aren't taken seriously by school divisions, Silva says she's never heard of a division taking this kind of legal step.

""Just the sheer image of a school board putting out cease-and-desist orders is pretty alarming,"" said Silva, who admits she isn't privy to all the communications that have occurred between the parents, the school and the school division.

""It puts parents in a position that either they're not going to come forward with their concerns, or they understand really clearly they're going to need to get legal counsel to do so. And that's going to make sure that a lot of people don't come forward with their concerns.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/rugby-federation-cancels-games-1.5120503,Or even make the padded skull caps mandatory.,4.0,58.0,"Players, parents and coaches are angry that the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation has decided to cancel public school rugby games across the province because of safety concerns.

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

Claire Avery, a rugby player at Charles P. Allen High School, said she and her teammates were shocked and devastated by the news.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Brooklyn Peyton, who plays rugby for Lockview High School in Fall River, hoped she would go to university on a rugby scholarship.

She said she's blown away by news of the cancellation.

'I just love the team'

""I started with this team, it's important to me, they are like family,"" she said. ""My coach means a lot to me. He's kind of like my second dad ... I just love the team.""

She and other rugby players at Lockview plan to wear their jerseys to school Friday and play some informal games on the school field to show support for the team.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the group has asked to meet with the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation about the decision to cancel school rugby. (CBC)

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

They hope to be back, but it'll be at least a year before they can return to Cape Breton, where they've sunk their life savings into a home and farm.

Reinhard and Romana Fugger have invested nearly $500,000 after buying and improving a rural property in Grand River, Richmond County, in 2015.

They say a local man, Frank Eckhardt and his company F.E. Property Sales, facilitated the property purchase and promised easy immigration to Canada.

The Fuggers say that help with the immigration process never came.

""We find this property and we think we can do this in an easy way, because we have the information before that it is not hard, maybe easy, to immigrate here,"" said Reinhard Fugger.

Eckhardt's company website, hosted in Germany and aimed at Europeans, advertises property sales and ""new settler consultation.""

The Fuggers say they found out after they got here that they paid more than the property was worth.

They paid $160,000 for 4.5 hectares of land with a small summer cottage to a lawyer recommended by Eckhardt who handled the real estate transaction. The property value was assessed at $82,000 at the time.

Real estate records show that most properties in the area sell for 1.5 times the assessed value, but the Fuggers paid 1.95 times the value.

The couple say they assumed that was because Eckhardt and the lawyer were going to help them with immigration.

Meanwhile, the Fuggers spent most of the first year digging a well, adding a stove and chimney, clearing the land and planting a garden.

Reinhard Fugger said the couple was so busy making their new place livable that their six-month visitor visas expired before they could apply for permanent residency.

Family served with removal order

When they turned to Eckhardt and the lawyer for help, they were referred to an immigration specialist in Halifax.

The Fuggers kept working on their property, bought another in nearby L'Ardoise, and had a second son, who is a Canadian citizen.

At the same time, they continued to try to apply for permanent residency on their own.

The Fuggers say they spent all their money on their property and couldn't afford an immigration lawyer or consultant.

Canada Border Services Agency eventually investigated and the Fuggers have now been served with a removal order.

They must leave by Wednesday, or face deportation and the possibility of not being able to return.

The Fuggers said they were naive and foolish to believe immigration would be easy, but Reinhard said they know they have to follow the rules and are resigned to leaving.

""In this time, we have to go back,"" he said. ""It is the only way. It is not allowed to do the paperwork inside Canada.""

Frank Eckhardt is a German immigrant who's lived in Cape Breton for 19 years.

He calls himself a property developer and runs his company out of an office in St. Peter's.

The Fuggers have emails and documents they say they got from Eckhardt implying that he was acting on their behalf in the land purchase, and they say he told them over the phone that immigration would be easy once they got here.

In an interview at his office, Eckhardt would not consent to being recorded.

But he said he is neither a realtor nor a registered immigration consultant, despite his website offering property sales along with ""new settler consultation.""

Eckhardt said he only sells land he owns or maintains an interest, and is simply willing to tell people about his immigration experience if they ask.

He said settler consultations consist of offering suggestions about local services, such as who sells insurance in Cape Breton, or who drills wells or builds homes.

""If someone asks me, 'OK, the nice home over there, do you know the owner?' I can give them the phone number,"" Eckhardt said.

He said he got no money for helping the Fuggers buy their property.

The Fuggers said they have an email in which Eckhardt admits he expects a commission from the property seller.

But Eckhardt said he doesn't know anything about that.

Eckhardt said he offered considerable help to the Fuggers when they first arrived in Canada, including putting them up in his guest cottage for weeks, for just the cost of the power, and allowing them to store a shipping container on his property for as long as needed.

Eckhardt said Richmond County, like all of Cape Breton, needs immigrants, and he is attracting them from Europe and helping maintain and create jobs in the area.

However, he said, people need to take personal responsibility for the rules and the process.

Immigration lawyer Lee Cohen says the Fuggers are in a bad situation, as owning property doesn't open any doors to immigration. (CBC)

Halifax immigration lawyer Lee Cohen said owning property doesn't open any doors to immigration, despite that widespread belief.

The Fuggers are in a terrible situation, he said.

Depending on the type of removal order, the Fuggers may have difficulty getting back into Canada, Cohen said.

Second son born in Cape Breton

Fugger gets emotional talking about his youngest son, who was born in the house overlooking Grand River.

""He's a citizen and he have the passport and all the things,"" Fugger said. ""Yeah, that's also a hard point for me.""

Despite their immigration troubles, the Fuggers have fallen in love with Cape Breton and hope to return.

""We want to stay here and we want to come back,"" said Fugger.

""Yeah, it's really great, because there are a lot of potential here to start up business, and ... the thing is we own a second property in L'Ardoise and we want to start up a business in this building.""

Michele MacPhee lives in the area and knows the Fuggers through their children's playgroup.

She said the Fuggers are hard workers with progressive ideas about food security and connecting children with nature.

""They're really good people,"" MacPhee said.

""They have done a lot to create a life for themselves here. I'm not familiar with the details of the process and the order ... (but) I'm comfortable with them staying.""

MacPhee said Cape Breton needs immigrants, especially ones like the Fuggers.

""They have a lot of skills and a lot of knowledge to share and I think that that certainly would be an additional asset for our community.""

Big if true,0.0,70.0,"Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

The reduction includes a $28 million cut to the $1.5 billion the province gives 49 children’s aid societies in Ontario, increasing concerns about the ability of agencies to serve and protect vulnerable children. The cut comes as 18 child protection agencies struggle with deficits totalling more than $12 million.

The deficits have already forced some agencies to lay off staff and reduce the number of children at risk they take into care.

“A decrease in children in care does not mean there are fewer children in need of protection,” the OACAS warned in a PowerPoint produced in late March, outlining its core messages before the provincial budget was tabled.

The association’s post-budget analysis suggests their warning may not have been heard.

The $84.5 million cut for youth at risk is contained in a May 16 “briefing note” the OACAS sent to top CAS officials, and obtained by the Star. The calculations are based on the government’s operating and capital spending estimates tabled in the legislature May 9.

Anti-poverty advocates shaken by cuts contemplated by Ford government

Opinion | Martin Regg Cohn: Secret document shows how far Doug Ford’s Tories would cut social services — until they were talked back from the brink

The OACAS calculated funding envelopes that fall under the budget line of “child and youth at risk,” including services for child protection and youth involved with the justice system.

The association is uncertain about the full impact of the cuts. Some funding envelopes have been eliminated and new ones created. It’s unclear if programs funded under the eliminated envelopes will continue to be funded under the new ones. Some of the cuts may involve the closing of unused facilities or resources, particularly in the area of youth justice. But when all the pluses and minuses are calculated, the funding shortfall is $84.5 million, according to the OACAS.

“We are concerned about the impact of any potential cuts to our members and to the families that they serve,” Nicole Bonnie, chief executive officer of the OACAS said in an email response to questions.

“At this time we do not have details as to which programs will be funded or who will deliver them,” Bonnie added. “We are waiting for more detailed information from the ministry to understand the exact nature of the impact on child welfare.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Bonnie hopes to soon meet with Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. “Our message is and always has been that the children and families we serve are the most marginalized and disenfranchised, and programs that support their well-being need to be fully funded.”

The minister’s office did not respond to direct questions about the cuts. In an emailed statement, MacLeod’s press secretary, Derek Rowland, described the well-being of vulnerable young people as the government’s “utmost priority.” The steady decline of children being taken into care since 2006, he added, has helped most children’s aid societies balance their budgets and the ministry is working with those that haven’t.

“We will be holding Ontario’s Children’s Aid Societies and other providers to higher standards to keep our kids safe,” Rowland said, denouncing what he described as “the lack of oversight and relaxed regulation” of the previous Liberal government.

Rowland said the government is increasing investments in prevention programs “to ensure kids keep out of trouble.” The government also “expects significant savings” in the youth justice sector after a review found “underutilized detention facilities.”

A plan to reduce the number of children’s aid societies through amalgamation is also being considered by the ministry.

What isn’t in doubt is that children’s aid societies will have less core funding to work with.

One children’s aid society, Brant Family and Children’s Services, has struggled with deficits that forced the layoff of 26 workers in March, in a community facing perhaps the worst opioid addiction epidemic in the province. Its executive director then posted a letter to the Brantford area community on the agency’s website, warning of serious consequences.

“When governments cut child welfare services (managers, front-line staff, and support services), children ultimately die or are allowed by society to live in unbearable, violent and neglectful conditions,” Andy Koster wrote.

“With higher caseloads and tight timelines, workers are forced to move from one crisis to another instead of planning and working proactively with families to prevent future incidents,” he added. “Despite best efforts, children fall through the cracks and suffer the consequences of insufficient resources.”

The cuts for children at risk also comes on the heels of the government eliminating the office that advocated for children and youth.

Kiaras Gharabaghi, director of Ryerson University’s School of Child and Youth Care, denounced the cuts as implemented without consultations.

“They are cuts that have no interest in making the system work better for kids and families,” he said in an interview after reviewing the OACAS document.

“This sector requires a different approach,” Gharabaghi added. “It’s one where young people die by violence, by suicide, by neglect. It’s not the same as increasing class sizes in schools to save some money.”

Michael Chertoff has a warning for Canada about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Canada's federal government is currently deciding whether Huawei can be trusted to build the next generation of Internet infrastructure across the country.

Chertoff, who was the United States' homeland security secretary under former president George W. Bush, says that decision could have major consequences for Canada's relationships with both China and the United States.

Meanwhile, Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is due to appear in a Vancouver court where a judge will consider an extradition request from the United States.

Here is part of Chertoff's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.

Mr. Chertoff, how is the United States likely to respond if Justin Trudeau agrees to allow Huawei 5G network to be a principal part of our system?

I think it's going to raise concerns about the security of your system.

We've seen stories recently, in fact, involving more back doors or problems with Chinese software and hardware.

So that's going to create some obstacles to the ability to rapidly share data because they're concerned that there'll be a compromise.

Chertoff cautions Canadians to reconsider pursuing a 5G network deal with Chinese tech giant Huawei. (Reuters)

You know that China says that Huawei is a private company — that the Chinese government is not involved with it and that there are firewalls that would protect these networks from any kind of Chinese influence. What does the United States think of that?

I think most Americans are skeptical of that for a number of reasons.

First of all, the Chinese clearly anoint certain companies as champions and support them.

And if you just look at what happened recently, with respect to Canadians being arrested in China as retaliation for the arrest of a senior Huawei official, it suggests a degree of solicitude for the company by the Chinese government that is is not consistent with the idea that they're independent.

To could give the Chinese the ability to occupy a pivotal part of your infrastructure, one that will be, as I say, the commanding heights of the next 10 or 20 years of the economy, you're giving them enormous leverage in any dispute.

You're giving them a surface area for which they can potentially take intellectual property or otherwise compromise confidential material and you have to, I think, seriously view China as a rival, if not an adversary.

The U.S. is seeking the extradition of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, but Canada appears to be bearing the brunt of China's displeasure in a situation that blurs the lines between politics and justice. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

What could they potentially do?

Well, they could either find or embed pathways in to compromise networks and allow the theft of intellectual property.

They could introduce disruption or latency into the network because it's not just the hardware and software that you first install. It's all of the updates, the patches, everything you do to them to tend to and monitor the system going forward.

It's not just a question of taking data and either misusing it or stealing intellectual property. This will actually be part of the mechanism that controls your industrial control systems and your operating systems.

So the person who dominates that, in a way, has the ability to affect everything from your power grid to your air traffic control system to your even your sensitive national security infrastructure.

The Canadian government is deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention of two Canadians in China. Read my statement: <a href=""https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc"">https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc</a> —@cafreeland

As you mentioned, we have two Canadians who are detained in China, held in isolation. Two others on death row. In other matters, our trade is being deeply effected as the Chinese shut us out of the markets. All this because of this extradition request from your country for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meanwhile, your president is busy securing a comprehensive free trade agreement with China and moving ahead and benefiting. So do you understand why Canadians might feel like we're being played here?

Well, I don't think that's a fair inference. Look, I think there are a couple of different things.

First of all, I mean obviously the security relationship the U.S. and Canada have is a very strong one. We're allies and I don't think anybody believes the U.S. is an ally of China — nor is it clear to me what's going to come out of this trade agreement.

I think what actually is demonstrated by Chinese behaviour is that when you're touching on what they view as one of their national champions, they will use any leverage they have to punish you.

And that ought to cause people to ask the question: well geez, if we give them the keys to the kingdom on our 5G network, what will they do if they don't like something we do in the future?

But wait a second. We arrested Meng Wanzhou at your behest, at your government's behest, and we're being punished while you move ahead with getting the trade deals that we're shut out of now. So I guess the question is, you know, at some point this seems rather unfair to us.

First of all, I don't know whether the Chinese aren't going to try to punish the U.S.

But if you're asking me why the Chinese decided they were going to focus on Canada in retaliating, I think it suggests they're trying to bully Canada and it may be that they feel they can get away with it more with Canada or that they can intervene before the extradition gets done.

Well, maybe the United States should start pushing back at our behest a bit.

I think we may see some further developments. I would not describe your relationship between China and the U.S. as a warm and fuzzy relationship.

There are a lot of different deals going on but I would be very careful not to have the Chinese try to drive a wedge between the Canadians and the Americans, by making it seem as if they're picking on one and not on the other.

Well, President Trump has said that he may trade Meng Wanzhou for getting his trade deals. So, maybe we're being played by your country as well.

I don't know what you're referring to and I don't read Twitter as a map for what's going to happen.

I would not presume anybody knows what's going to be the next step in all this because there are a lot of balls in the air.

Is it not true that President Trump suggested that he could exchange Meng Wanzhou for a trade deal with China?

He often says all kinds of different things, which never come to pass. So I'm not going to speculate as to what was in his head. But I'm not going to presume that this has any realistic prospect of happening.

I don't have to agree with Saudi Arabia's laws, that's a ridiculous foisted argument. I can say that it might be *lawful* for them to do so, while being morally abhorrent. Just as I would prefer that third world countries punish our sex tourists over there (I think a Thai jail is likely to be a significantly greater deterrent than a Canadian one).

However, we have a duty to the world to ensure that when Canadian citizens travel abroad, that they behave as good citizens. If they choose to break certain laws because they believe they can escape punishment in countries with ineffective justice systems, I'm glad we have mechanisms to do so.",2.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

'These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,' SNC-Lavalin's president and CEO Neil Bruce said Wednesday. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon has pushed for SNC-Lavalin to receive a DPA. (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

That they have tryed to interfere with...,0.0,16.0,"OTTAWA—The federal government is still weighing whether Huawei can help build Canada’s 5G infrastructure as the U.S. took one step closer to banning the Chinese telecom giant.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Wednesday that the government continues to review “all potential suppliers” for Canada’s next generation of wireless networks from both a technological and national security perspective.

Goodale was speaking just before President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk, paving the way for a ban on doing business with China’s Huawei Technologies.

“We obviously pay careful attention to what our allies are saying and doing. Some have expressed views, others have not,” Goodale said outside the House of Commons.

“We’ll take all that into account, but we want to make the very best decision for Canada with respect to the technology and also on national security. Our national security will not be compromised.”

The U.S. has actively lobbied allies to keep Huawei technology out of American networks, suggesting it could be used to spy for Beijing.

Huawei has aggressively and repeatedly denied allegations it poses a national security threat.

Extradition proceedings for Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou to begin in January

Canada has been reviewing Huawei’s involvement in the country’s 5G infrastructure — “5G” refers to the fifth generation of wireless technology, with each generation increasing how fast data can be transferred — for months.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said a government led by him would ban Huawei on national security grounds.

“I believe there are many security concerns as it relates to Huawei and the development of Canada’s 5G. We know the government of China has acknowledged its role in certain cyber-attacks,” Scheer told reporters Wednesday.

“It’s up to the government of Canada to protect not just the personal information of Canadians but also the integrity of Canadian institutions.”

Trump’s order would have little impact on the main wireless carriers in the U.S., which do not employ Huawei products in their networks. According to Reuters, only about 25 per cent of smaller U.S. carriers use equipment from Huawei and another Chinese supplier, ZTE.

But a move by Trump to officially ban all Huawei products could be another salvo in the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.

A U.S. ban would also put constraints on what Ottawa can do. In an interview with Sky News last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo strongly suggested that the U.S. could limit intelligence sharing with countries that allow Huawei technology in their networks.

“We don’t believe you can have those technologies in your systems and still have a trusted network,” Pompeo

“But the United States, for its part, will only participate in trusted networks. We will only share America’s information with those networks that we are confident aren’t under the control of China . . . There’s really risk if countries choose that path, that we won’t be able to participate in those networks.”

A breakdown in intelligence sharing with the U.S. would have serious ramifications for Canada, which is a net importer of intelligence in the Five Eyes alliance, and is likely a consideration in the federal government’s review of the 5G file.

Goodale wouldn’t say Wednesday when that review will be released. Bloomberg News, citing unnamed government officials, reported last week that the Liberals could delay a decision until after October’s federal election.

Salt Spring Island, Canada's green magnet, claims to have the highest concentration of electric vehicle owners in North America.

And it stands to reason. The island, off the B.C. coastline, is just 27 kilometres end to end. A round trip is well within reach of even the EVs with the most limited range on the market. Temperate winters also mean EV batteries aren't subject to extreme cold, which can reduce range by up to a quarter in Canada's more frigid communities.

The provincial government also offers a rebate which, as of this month, can be combined with a new federal rebate of up to $5,000 to buy electric vehicles.

But while Salt Spring Island might seem like an EV utopia, not everyone who'd like a set of greener wheels is perfectly happy. And it's for largely the same set of reasons keeping many Canadians in other parts of the country from letting go of gasoline-powered transportation.

Size matters in the car-buying environment, and for those seeking zero emissions there's currently little available beyond small cars.

Need to haul a lot of material to work or a bunch of kids to their game? For those who need more seats or bigger cargo capacity, there's just one model to choose from in Canada at the moment when it comes to affordable electric vehicles.

""With my business, it's all about how many people I can get in the van and sell more seats to make it financial viable,"" says Jason Griffin, who runs a tour business for visitors to Salt Spring.

The minivan he bought, ""was my only real option for a vehicle this size,"" and it isn't purely electric. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica runs on an electric motor for 50 to 100 km until the battery depletes, and then a gasoline engine takes over.

Griffin says he plans his trips around the short 50 km electric range of his hybrid van, so it's sufficient for his tour company’s needs. (Jill English/CBC)

Mind you, Griffin plans his trips and charging stops around that to maximize his electric mileage. He says he still has the same tank of gas in the van that was there when he bought it nine months ago.

Manufacturers are well aware of the demand for larger and more diverse designs, and they're racing to broaden their EV product lines.

Hyundai has introduced a small electric five-seater SUV called the Kona, joining Tesla's much larger (and more expensive) Model X. Kia has a comparable model in the new Niro.

Meanwhile, both Tesla and Ford are working on a pick-up truck that they say will have extended electric-powered driving range."

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Lawyer Bob Buckingham, right, represented Harrisson at the trial in St. John's. (Mark Quinn/ CBC)

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

The new regulations announced Friday will be launched in two phases. Some regulations come into force on July 15, while others will not take effect until December 15.

""Our goal was to provide a world-leading approach to air passenger rights that would be predictable and fair for passengers while ensuring our air carriers remain strong and competitive,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement.

""After a long and thorough consultation process, I am proud to say these new regulations achieve that balance and will give air travellers the rights and treatment they pay for and deserve,"" he added.

The regulations will apply to all flights to, from and within Canada, including connecting flights. Large airlines, those that have serviced two million passengers or more in the last two years, will have a slightly different regulatory regime than smaller airlines in some cases.

Smaller airlines, for example, will have to pay less compensation for delays or cancellations that are within the airline's control but are not related to safety issues.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau announces new regulations and penalties for airlines related to air travel delays. 1:50

Broadly, flight disruptions — tarmac delays, flight cancellations, and denials of boarding — that are within an airline's control require compensation be paid, standards of treatment be upheld and the passenger's itinerary be completed.

Flight disruptions within an airline's control but required for safety reasons will not require compensation but airlines will have to maintain a standard of treatment and complete a passenger's itinerary.

Situations outside an airline's control that cause a flight disruption will only require the airline to ensure the passenger's itinerary is completed.

Situations within an airline's control include overbooking and scheduled maintenance.

Delays within an airline's control due to safety include mechanical problems and safety calls made by the pilot.

Disruptions outside an airline's control include a wide range of possibilities such as political instability, weather, natural disasters and security threats.

Rules in place by July 15

The first set of rules lays out the regulations and compensation regime related to delays on the tarmac, what happens when a passenger is denied boarding, lost and damaged luggage and the transportation of musical instruments.

The standards of treatment during a delay on the tarmac that must be in force by July 15 include ensuring that all passengers have access to working toilets.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau speaks during a news conference in Ottawa last month. Garneau said new rules announced Friday for airlines came after extensive consultation with passengers and the industry. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

An airline will also have to ensure the aircraft is properly ventilated and kept either cool or warm depending on the time of year. Passengers will also have to be provided food and drink and the ability to communicate with people outside of the plane free of charge, if possible.

Planes that have been on the tarmac for three hours will be required to return to the gate so people can get off. The only exception is when a departure is likely within the first 45 minutes after the three-hour time. In that case, the plane can remain where it is.

Overbooking

Starting July 15, passengers who are prevented from boarding an aircraft because of overbooking will be compensated financially depending on the length of time they are delayed from reaching their final destination.

Overbooking delays of less than six hours will require a minimum $900 payment, delays between six and nine hours mean a minimum $1,800 payment and delays longer than nine hours will see passengers compensated a minimum of $2,400.

When it comes to lost or damaged baggage, an airline will be liable for $2,100 for the lost bag and will also have to refund any baggage fees paid for the lost bag.

Airlines are also going to have to include terms and conditions for the transportation of musical instruments whether they are taken as a carry on or are checked into the cargo hold.

Phase two

The rules and compensation for cancelled flights and delays are part of phase two of the rollout.

As of December 15, airlines will have to provide compensation to passengers for delayed or cancelled flights depending on the size of the airline.

Delayed arrival at a final destination of between three to six hours will cost large airlines $400 and small airlines $125. Delays of between six to nine hour will cost large airlines $700 and small airlines $250. Delays greater than nine hours will cost large airlines $1,000 and smaller airlines half that amount.

The regulations do not only require an airline ensure the passenger gets to their final destination, but that they do so in the same class of service.

If an airline cannot rebook a passenger on their own airline and the delay is longer than nine hours, the airline has to book the passenger on a competing airline. If the passenger decides the delay has rendered the trip useless they will get a refund and the required financial compensation.

By mid December, airlines will also have to ensure that children under the age of five are seated next to their parent or guardian, children aged five to 11 are in the same row and no more than one seat away from their parent or guardian and children aged 12 or 13 are no more than one row away.

Airlines that don't adhere to the new standards can be fined up to $25,000 per incident by the Canadian Transport Agency.

""Thousands of Canadians participated in the consultations that helped shape these new rules,"" Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency, said in a statement.

Come back and argue the sky is purple then.",2.0,145.0,"The Canada Revenue Agency has once again made a secret out-of-court settlement with wealthy KPMG clients caught using what the CRA itself had alleged was a ""grossly negligent"" offshore ""sham"" set up to avoid detection by tax authorities, CBC's The Fifth Estate and Radio-Canada's Enquête have learned.

This, despite the Liberal government's vow to crack down on high-net-worth taxpayers who used the now-infamous Isle of Man scheme. The scheme orchestrated by accounting giant KPMG enabled clients to dodge tens of millions of dollars in taxes in Canada by making it look as if multimillionaires had given away their fortunes to anonymous overseas shell companies and get their investment income back as tax-free gifts.

KPMG is a global network of accounting and auditing firms headquartered out of the Netherlands and is one of the top firms in Canada.

""Tax cheats can no longer hide,"" National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier promised in 2017.

Now, Tax Court documents obtained by CBC News/Radio-Canada show two members of the Cooper family in Victoria, as well as the estate of the late patriarch Peter Cooper, reached an out-of-court settlement on May 24 over their involvement in the scheme.

Details of the settlement and even minutes of the meetings discussing it are under wraps. A CBC News/Radio-Canada reporter who showed up to one such meeting this spring left after realizing it was closed to the public.

Journalists discovered references to the final settlement agreement in Tax Court documents only by chance.

CRA cites privacy in keeping settlement details secret

The Canada Revenue Agency says strict privacy provisions of Canadian tax law make it difficult to disclose minutes describing individual taxpayer information.

The Isle of Man tax dodge had been active as far back as 1999 and, according to documents filed in Tax Court by the CRA in 2015, had ""intended to deceive"" federal regulators.

Still, significant details of the scheme remain a mystery, including the role played by the KPMG's senior executives. With no public trial, those details may continue to remain secret.

Toby Sanger, executive director of the advocacy group Canadians for Tax Fairness, says the CRA should never have agreed to settle the case.

""I think it's outrageous,"" he said. ""We've had a lot of tough talk and promises from this minister about how they will crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy and corporations, but unfortunately, we've seen no evidence of this so far.""

Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier said in an email statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête that while she cannot comment on specific cases, she finds the lack of transparency about settlements brokered by her agency ""problematic.""

""I have instructed the CRA to review its processes to allow for more transparency with respect to the reasons for which a settlement is reached,"" she said.

KPMG took 15% cut of taxes dodged

One member of the Cooper family, Marshall Cooper, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s and that it was KPMG that came up with the offshore tax plan.

Documents show KPMG planned to take a 15 per cent cut of the taxes dodged, including $300,000 from the Cooper family. Internal records show the scheme was marketed across the country, with successful KPMG sales agents and accountants referred to as product ""champions.""

Marshall Cooper, pictured, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s. (Facebook)

In all, more than 20 wealthy families participated in the offshore scheme.

Two years ago, Lebouthillier issued a news release outlining her intention to clamp down on the KPMG scheme, publicly stating that those involved could even face criminal charges over possible ""tax fraud.""

""The case of KPMG is before the courts right now, and we continue to pursue action against KPMG,"" Lebouthillier said in 2017 in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""We will see this to the end as Canadians have asked us to do.""

She said at the time that her government took the matter ""very seriously.""

""Those who choose to participate in these schemes must face the consequences of their actions,"" she said in a separate statement.

Yet more than two years after that pledge, participants in the KPMG scheme, namely, members of the Cooper family, were offered a secret out-of-court settlement.

In her statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête this week, Lebouthillier said the decision to settle was not hers to make and that she had instructed the CRA to review its settlements to ""allow for more transparency.""

Minister says 'systemic changes' are coming

To ""ensure integrity of our tax system,"" Lebouthillier said, out-of-court settlements are made by the CRA and the Department of Justice ""at arm's length"" from the minister and the minister's office.

""Canadians deserve a fair and equitable tax system, and we will continue to make systemic changes within the CRA to make sure that this is the case,"" she said in her statement this week.

CBC News/Radio-Canada first revealed four years ago that KPMG, one of the largest accounting firms in Canada, with tens of millions in federal contracts, had for years been running a massive offshore tax dodge for wealthy clients it had kept hidden from federal investigators.

The Trudeau government's previous tough talk on the so-called sham had come after a document leaked to The Fifth Estate/Enquête showed the CRA itself had offered a secret ""no penalties"" amnesty in May 2015 to many of the KPMG clients involved in the scheme.

The CRA offered to have them simply pay the back taxes owed — but with the condition they not tell the public about the offer.

Liberal MPs halted a parliamentary finance committee investigation in 2016 after KPMG argued the investigation could prejudice court cases. Now, it looks like those court cases might never happen. (CBC)

Stung by those revelations, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in 2017 that the government had learned a lesson from the KPMG affair and promised to do a ""better job of getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.""

Since then, the Liberal government vowed to make sure those kinds of offshore tax dodges were in the past.

In fact, it was concerns over future KPMG court cases that prompted the Liberal-dominated House of Commons finance committee to shut down its own investigation into the embattled accounting firm back in 2016.

Documents had already begun to emerge detailing the extent to which KPMG was helping clients not only dodge taxes but also hide money from potential creditors, including circumventing the Canadian Divorce Act by ""protecting"" assets from ex-spouses.

Lawyers for KPMG had argued that the ongoing finance committee investigation could prejudice cases before the court.

Several KPMG executives had been named to testify in the spring of 2016, but Liberal MPs voted to shut down the inquiry, arguing that any more testimony and documents should be produced in court and not in Parliament.

Now, it appears that those future court cases cited as a reason for shutting down the investigation might never materialize.

The Fifth Estate and Enquête also later revealed that in June 2016, around the same time the Liberal MPs shut down their investigation, a former senior KPMG executive was appointed to the Liberal Party's national board of directors.

""There is no reason why the finance committee shouldn't restart their hearings,"" Canadians for Tax Fairness's Sanger said.

Settlements offer 'substantial savings to the public'

Sanger said it all seems like a Liberal ""coverup"" to close down the KPMG investigation.

Canadians still do not know who were the key people at KPMG involved in running the investigation, for example, how high up it went within the organization, or all the names of the wealthy clients who participated.

Max Weder, the lawyer for the Cooper family, said he ""can't comment on the settlement.""

Documents show the family paid virtually no tax over a span of eight years — and even obtained federal and provincial tax credits — despite receiving nearly $6 million from an offshore company worth $26 million that KPMG helped set up.

KPMG has always maintained the scheme was legal. The firm's lawyers claimed any money the Coopers received were gifts and therefore non-taxable. Nevertheless, KPMG now says it would not set up this type of offshore structure anymore.

For its part, the CRA said that the settlement was made in accordance with the law and is ""supported by the facts of this particular case."" The agency also said it ""maximized revenue"" by making a decision to settle out of court, instead of facing an uncertain ruling in Tax Court.

""There is generally substantial savings to the public and a benefit to the justice system when cases are resolved through a settlement,"" a CRA spokesperson said in a statement.

I'm not worried about it.",1.0,16.0,"The Ford government plans to stop all funding to an institute that supports Ontario scientists at the cutting edge of stem cell research.

Provincial officials have told the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine (OIRM) that its $5 million in annual funding from the province will cease next March.

The Toronto-based institute provides grants to help Ontario researchers turn their their stem cell discoveries into treatments that are both medically and commercially viable.

The government's decision to terminate the funding is ""extremely short-sighted and uninformed,"" said Bernard Thébaud, a neonatal researcher who received funding from OIRM to explore the use of stem cells in preventing complications from premature birth.

""If [the government] would do a careful analysis, they would realize this is a worthwhile investment,"" said Thébaud, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and professor of pediatrics at the University of Ottawa.

Bernard Thébaud, a neonatologist at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and a senior scientist with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, says if the government would do a 'careful analysis' it would realize stem-cell research is a 'worthwhile investment.' (Canadian Lung Association)

His work has shown that stem cells isolated from the umbilical cord have the potential to prevent brain and lung damage in premature babies and promote healthy development of the organs as the children age.

""We believe this [research] could be a game-changer for these pre-term babies and could substantially improve their outcomes,"" Thébaud said Wednesday in an interview.

The funding to OIRM came from Ontario's Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. The minister responsible, Todd Smith, said the researchers can turn to the private sector.

""The previous government was throwing millions of dollars around like crazy and they were not holding anyone accountable as to how they were spending that money,"" Smith told reporters Wednesday at Queen's Park.

""What we've heard from the life-sciences sector is that a lot of these organizations don't actually need government money, that the private sector will step up,"" said Smith.

But scientists in the stem-cell field say the private sector is not willing to invest until their studies reach a late phase. To get there, they say government funding is crucial.

""We pick the really outstanding projects that have true potential and we fund them to the point where they can attract additional funding and then begin to move forward,"" said Duncan Stewart, president and scientific director of OIRM.

""Without a catalyst to kick-start the process, then it's not going to happen.""

The scientists see a bitter irony in the government's move, since stem cell research was born in Ontario. James Till and Ernest McCulloch discovered the existence of stem cells in 1961 at the Toronto-based Ontario Cancer Institute.

""It's very deflating, it's very disappointing to learn that this is going to not continue,"" said Stewart.

""The concern is that many great ideas, great technologies that could have blossomed into successful new opportunities commercially and new therapies for our patients just aren't going to move forward.""

Duncan Stewart, president and scientific director of the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine, is hopeful the government can be persuaded to renew OIRM's funding instead of stopping it. (Mike Crawley/CBC)

Research funded by OIRM attracted a $225-million investment by pharmaceutical giant Bayer and venture capital firm Versant Ventures to create BlueRock Therapeutics, now headquartered in Toronto. The company aims to treat heart disease and degenerative brain diseases.

""We were very excited about what we were able to accomplish with relatively modest funding,"" said Stewart.

The institute was created in 2014, with a promise from the Wynne government of $25 million over five years.

Stewart said he is hopeful the government can be persuaded to renew OIRM's funding instead of stopping it.

""We have a year, and a year is a long time in politics,"" said Stewart.

""We're hoping to use that time to try to position ourselves to continue in some way. Unfortunately, we have no idea what will happen after that."""

Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced in his fall economic update that the federal government would make $600 million in tax credits and incentives available to selected media outlets over the next five years.

An independent panel of experts was to be tasked with naming the eligible news organizations and assisting the government in implementing the measures.

""Today, we are reaching another milestone toward the implementation of these tax measures that aim to support Canadian journalism and journalism in under-served communities,"" said Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez.

The eight associations that have been asked to select a representative to sit on the independent panel by the middle of June are: News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, Unifor and the Fédération nationale des communications.

According to a statement released by Rodriguez's office, the panel members will be expected to consult with third parties and industry stakeholders before reporting back to the minister's office by late July.

In his fall update, Morneau announced some details of the $600 million program to help Canada's news media organizations — many of which have been struggling with diminishing revenue and falling readership numbers.

Under the program, news media organizations are eligible for refundable tax credits, a non-refundable tax credit for subscriptions to Canadian digital news and access to charitable tax incentives for not-for-profit journalism.

Rodriguez also named the seven organizations representing different segments of the news media which will be responsible for administering an additional fund of $50 million over five years to help regional media outlets.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

 Beer Store *is* private.",13.0,70.0,"Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

But a VPN will probably protect you from a casual ""record everything going through the internet"" sweep, and more relevantly people who are trying to get in your system for their own purposes.",9.0,120.0,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

Social media giants ignore law, don’t take Canada seriously, say MPs

Star Editorial | Christchurch Call is a good step in fighting extremism

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

I really only watch the olympics, but a close game with all sorts or shit in play on the last throw of the last end is as nail biting as any sport.",1.0,56.0,"Story transcript

Curling has been a staple of Canadian winters for decades, but there are some things that have changed over the years — like a skip sliding down the ice with a cigarette in his mouth.

Orest (The Big O) Meleschuk knows a little about smoking on the international stage, because he is the skip in a video that As It Happens recently dug up from the CBC Archives.

In it, a younger Meleschuk can be seen throwing an extremely important rock for Team Canada at the 1972 Silver Broom world championship in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria — complete with a lit dart in his mouth.

""Well you know, if it sits in an ashtray it's going to burn out and I was quite frugal in those days,"" Meleschuk told As It Happens host Carol Off from his home in Selkirk, Man.

""I didn't want to waste it.""

That throw by Meleschuk began one of the most contentious plays in curling history — known as the ""Great Kicked Rock Caper"".

The Canadian team needed two points to force another end against Team U.S.A., or the game was over and Canada would not hold their title for the fifth consecutive year.

As Meleschuk explains, he knocked the U.S. rock out but the Canadian's tying rock rolled farther than he had anticipated. Thinking they had won, the U.S. skip Bob LaBonte ran onto the ice, slipped and kicked the Canadian rock in premature celebration. ​

Canada ended up winning the match in an extra end.

'Beer out of a stein'

Meleschuk says he can't remember exactly how Team Canada celebrated their championship win, but since the match was held in Bavaria it was probably with a beer as opposed to their regular drink — whiskey straight.

""I drank my beer out of a stein, this way they didn't know whether it was milk or water or beer.""

Meleschuk remembered how popular smoking was back in the '70s and how much rinks have changed.

""A lot of curlers smoked. [There were] ashtrays on the boards and back of the ends. Ashtrays all over the place,"" he said.

But he admits that after watching video footage after the event of himself curling with a cigarette, he was a ""little bit embarrassed"" and decided to quit smoking.

""I quit after that year because I was watching a few films and I thought it was so disgusting that I thought I better quit,"" he said.

A broom a game

Meleschuk said he is impressed with how far the equipment has come in the last 40 years — most notably the brooms.

""In those days ... a broomer used to go through a broom almost every two games,"" he said.

""They really go through a broom in a game but we couldn't afford to buy that many brooms so you kept the broom as long as you could.""

That's because the brooms were made out of straw, as opposed to the squeegee-like brushes that are used now. The brooms would leave the sweepers with blisters all over their hands — something Meleschuk doesn't think curlers could handle now.

""I don't think any of the brushers now could flop that broom around from one end to the other for 12 ends, which we used to play,"" he said.

It also meant that there was straw all over the ice, something that could impede the rock if the house sweeper didn't do their job properly.

When it was pointed out to him that the cigarette ash on the ice may have also been a factor, Meleschuk laughed.

""That's why we used to have burnt rocks, because of the hot ashes."""

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

Claire Avery, a rugby player at Charles P. Allen High School, said she and her teammates were shocked and devastated by the news.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Brooklyn Peyton, who plays rugby for Lockview High School in Fall River, hoped she would go to university on a rugby scholarship.

She said she's blown away by news of the cancellation.

'I just love the team'

""I started with this team, it's important to me, they are like family,"" she said. ""My coach means a lot to me. He's kind of like my second dad ... I just love the team.""

She and other rugby players at Lockview plan to wear their jerseys to school Friday and play some informal games on the school field to show support for the team.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the group has asked to meet with the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation about the decision to cancel school rugby. (CBC)

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,"Fundamentalist Islam demands the slaughter of infidels. So yeah that's likely a reach to say she's a terrorist just for wanting to wear a hijab to work.

There is a discussion to be had about secularism over religious symbols and dress at the workplace however.",20.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Djemila Benhabib, representing the Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité, said Tuesday that some Muslim women who wear the hijab are 'fundamentalists.' (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

Are you hearing yourself?

&gt;I can only imagine what other competing companies do if Haliburton is also trying for those projects.

Since you can't compete with slave labour, we might as well enslave our labourers wouldn't you say?",5.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

'These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,' SNC-Lavalin's president and CEO Neil Bruce said Wednesday. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."
https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2019/05/10/beer-store-union-launches-ad-blitz-attacking-premier-doug-ford-for-threatening-7000-jobs.html,Someone is gonna have to deliver all thay beer.   Shaddup beer store union.   Dofoornot this needs to be done,3.0,70.0,"Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/flood-plains-1.5135336,"Looking at you ""high river""",1.0,109.0,"Note to outraged conservative readers: this opinion column was not assigned by Katie Telford. (The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

Five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

More on that next week."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/national-gun-trafficking-straw-buying-smuggling-firearms-1.5126228,You can’t ban guns without the help of propaganda,22.0,34.0,"Police are scrambling to keep pace with criminals who are coming up with creative ways to supply Canada's black market with firearms.

""Gun violence is getting worse, there is more access to firearms,"" Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told CBC News. ""And so we have to look at the problem from a bigger perspective.""

That means looking more closely at the flow of guns throughout the country.

Police are trying to reduce the number of guns through things like Toronto's current gun buyback program, which pays $200 for long guns and $350 for handguns. By Friday, two weeks into the three-week program, it had collected 1,235 firearms. But even as programs like this seek to get guns out of circulation, fresh ones are being added through the black market.

The majority of the illegal guns in Canada used to be smuggled across the border from the U.S., but that seems to be changing. According to police, a growing number of guns are bought legally in Canada and resold on the black market, or made here illegally.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says the force is trying to reduce gun violence in the city, and efforts include a gun-buyback program. (CBC)

That's not to say smuggling isn't still a problem. The number of firearms confiscated at the Canada-U.S. border has fluctuated over the years — 751 were seized during the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.

They are hidden in gas tanks, the trunks of cars, in luggage, or on someone's body. In one remarkable instance involving Montrealer Alexis Vlachos, firearms were smuggled through a public library that straddles the border with the U.S.

WATCH: The National's feature on where violent criminals get guns in Canada

Last year, The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was granted an extra $51.5 million in funding over five years to enhance screening, detection and training around firearms smuggling. The RCMP were also given $34.5 million over five years for the new Integrated Criminal Firearms Initiative to enhance intelligence gathering, technology and investigations.

Superintendent Jason Crowley with the Windsor police department says the appeal of smuggling guns is pure economics.

""You will see a gun, a firearm purchased in the States for potentially $200 to $300, and they'll go on the streets [in Canada] for $3,000.""

Crowley calls it a ""pipeline"" — guns smuggled across the border from Detroit into Windsor, and then to cities across the country. He says the influx of firearms has contributed to an increase in violent gun crime in Canada.

Home-made guns

However, Crowley points out that it's not only guns smuggled across the border that are a concern these days.

Last December, police in Ontario busted a firearm manufacturing ring and confiscated so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms assembled from parts obtained legally and without any serial numbers.

Police also say 3D printers and other devices are being used to either make guns, or create parts that turn some firearms into automatic weapons capable of firing many more rounds a minute. Such guns have been found across the country.

Police in Winnipeg said this week that the number of homemade firearms seized on the streets has spiked from three in 2016, to more than 60 last year.

""I think it's safe to say that the creation of weapons will be something that will definitely play a huge, disruptive factor when it comes to community safety in the years to come,"" Toronto's Chief Saunders says.

Information compiled recently by data aggregation platform Echosec showed how illegal weapons are available for purchase on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet where the black market flourishes.

A recent search for keywords including gun, Canada, Ontario and Toronto got 25 hits. Another search for ""weapon"" got 164 results. All the firearms, from a specialized pistol to assault-style rifles, were apparently available for purchase and could be couriered to someone's home.

Chief Saunders says the changing sources of firearms and how they're circulated is a growing concern. ""It's going to be a whole new script, and it will be borderless when it comes to anyone that is motivated to access or use a part.""

Straw buyers

Another growing source of illegal guns in Canada, according to police, is firearms that were originally bought legitimately through retailers.

While the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police says it is working with Statistics Canada to compile national figures, Chief Saunders says what he's seen in Toronto is a growing concern.

""It's Toronto-specific that the crime guns, that the majority of them are domestic, predominately through straw purchasing,"" Saunders says.

Some of these guns were stolen from their legitimate owners and resold, others were bought legally by Canadians and then offered for sale illegally for a profit.

""Straw purchasing"" is when a legal Canadian firearm licence-holder buys a gun and then sells it on the black market. Criminals try to remove the serial numbers to make them untraceable.

""Those guns are now in the illegal market and being used as crime guns, typically,"" Crowley says.

And it is happening across the country. Law enforcement officials refer to widely publicized cases of Canadians being convicted of selling legally purchased guns on the black market.

Among the more notable cases is Justin Green, a former philosophy student at the University of Toronto, who legally purchased 23 handguns over the course of 22 months starting in 2011, including as many as 15 from a single location, and then illegally resold them. That same year, Andrew Winchester purchased 47 handguns in the Greater Toronto Area over the course of six months, selling them on the illegal market for as much as $100,000.

Green and Winchester were only caught after the guns they purchased and resold were found at crime scenes and identified. Straw purchasing cases have also recently occurred in Alberta and B.C., with officers telling CBC News it is a growing concern for them as well.

""Straw purchasing is a hot-button topic,"" says Wes Winkel, owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to identify a possible straw purchaser, although there are some telltale signs.

""They tend never to buy accessories. You know, most sports shooters will need accessories to go with their firearms, whether it be holsters, ammunition, stuff like that.""

Wes Winkel, is the owner of the Ellwood Epps sporting goods store in Severn, Ont. He says it can be tough for retailers to pick out a possible straw buyer, and law enforcement authorities have been slow to identify them based on sales records. (Mia Sheldon/CBC)

Still, Winkel says the proposals meant to stop it — including broadened background checks, licence verification and extended mandatory record-keeping by gun retailers that includes details of the gun and who bought it — would not be effective because the real issue is a lack of enforcement.

Winkel says years of sales records are already kept by retailers, and yet authorities aren't effectively using that information to quickly flag straw buyers. ""For whatever reason, the amount of time it takes for law enforcement to identify a straw person is too long.""

Still, Crowley of the Windsor Police says stronger legislative measures would help.

""There is a demand for these guns, these firearms, and there's definitely going to be a market,"" he says, and the potential for profit will continue to fuel straw buying and smuggling without deterrents.

Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-adds-record-jobs-april-1.5130682,People vote on the economy but politics has very little to do with the economy. What can ya do!,-4.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/flood-plains-1.5135336,Household income. Often that is 2 working adults.,3.0,109.0,"Note to outraged conservative readers: this opinion column was not assigned by Katie Telford. (The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

Five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

More on that next week."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/snc-lavalin-trial-corruption-bribery-1.5153429,Arguing in bad faith is not a crime. Bribery on the other hand...,0.0,310.0,"There is enough evidence against SNC-Lavalin for the engineering corporation to be tried on fraud and bribery charges, a Quebec court judge ruled Wednesday.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

That's how Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research, sees the Newfoundland and Labrador provincial election after a poll conducted among 856 potential voters was released on Thursday.

Among decided or leaning voters polled, 42 per cent support the Progressive Conservatives, while the Liberals hold 40 per cent, the New Democrats are at 13 per cent, and six per cent selected ""other"" options.

A few seats for the third party could mean the difference between a majority and a minority. - Lorne Bozinoff

The difference between the two leading parties is within the margin of error — plus or minus three per cent, 19 times out of 20 — meaning it's too close to confidently say one party is leading over the other.

The poll did not account for undecided voters. When asked why, Bozinoff told The St. John's Morning Show it didn't matter.

""We take them out because we believe at the end of the day, most of the undecideds will vote the way everyone else will vote. They'll break basically in the same proportions, or they won't vote.""

Of the 856 respondents, only 79 said they were undecided, leaving 91 per cent of people decided or leaning.

Based on the 777 respondents counted in the results, Forum Research estimates the PCs will win 19 seats, the Liberals 18 and the NDP three.

""What will be fascinating to watch is how the NDP will factor into the final results,"" Bozinoff said. ""Even just a few seats for the third party could mean the difference between a majority and a minority government.""

This is the third poll released in Newfoundland and Labrador this week, with each showing different results.

Abacus Data had the PCs five percentage points higher than the Liberals among decided voters, while MQO suggested the Liberals had a 12-point lead over the PCs — again, among decided voters.

Forum Research was the only group of pollsters to accurately predict the PC party was leading in the recent Prince Edward Island election.

Trouble for Liberals in central

The polling suggests the strongest support for the PCs is in ""central Newfoundland and Grand Falls-Windsor,"" where most districts are currently red.

Forum Research says 48 per cent of respondents in the region support the PC party, whereas support for the Liberals is at 37 per cent.

The west coast of Newfoundland shows the strongest support for the Liberals, with 45 per cent of respondents saying they'd vote red.

More than half dissatisfied with all leaders

While the numbers for party support is close, the number of people disapproving of all three party leaders is even closer.

""None of them did that well,"" Bozinoff said.

The poll suggested 63 per cent of respondents disapprove of the job Dwight Ball has done as premier, while 37 per cent support him.

For Ches Crosbie, 55 per cent of people disapprove of his abilities to lead the Progressive Conservative party, while 45 per cent approve.

Leaders Alison Coffin, Dwight Ball and Ches Crosbie are vying for the top job in the province. (CBC)

For the NDP, 52 per cent disapprove of Alison Coffin's job as leader, while 48 per cent approve.

About 40 per cent of respondents didn't think there was a winner at the leader's debate broadcast by CBC and NTV on May 1.

When asked if they thought Newfoundland and Labrador was better or worse off than it was four years ago, 66 per cent said worse, with 42 per cent saying ""much worse.""

Sources who spoke to CBC News on condition they remain anonymous said the two former cabinet ministers spoke with Green Party Leader Elizabeth May several times about possibly running for her party.

Wilson-Raybould also attended May's wedding in Victoria at the end of April, stoking rumours that she might jump to the Greens.

Wilson-Raybould currently sits as an independent MP for Vancouver Granvillle and Philpott for Markham-Stouffville.

The two women quit the Liberal cabinet over the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair — which went public early in the year after Wilson-Raybould accused senior officials in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government of pressuring her inappropriately to allow the Quebec-based engineering firm to avoid a trial on corruption charges. They were subsequently kicked out of the Liberal caucus on April 2.

Getting two high-profile ex-Liberals to run for the Greens — especially ones so closely tied to the biggest political scandal to face the Trudeau government — would have given May extra horsepower heading into this election season.

The Greens have been surging recently. On Monday, May will officially welcome the party's second MP into the House of Commons. Paul Manly will be sworn in after winning the recent Nanaimo-Ladysmith byelection in British Columbia by a comfortable margin.

The Greens also have seen an uptick in support in recent provincial elections. In P.E.I., the party took over as the Official Opposition after winning eight seats in April. Ontario voted in its first Green MPP this year. And in 2017, the party won three seats in B.C., giving it the balance of power in the province.

It isn't clear yet if Wilson-Raybould or Philpott will run as independents. Historically, about one-third of Canadian MPs have successfully been re-elected as independents after leaving their parties."

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Liberals, Trudeau hit new low but poll suggests surging Tory support is soft

Maxime Bernier fails to gain momentum in Conservative territory

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

Since Bernier set out on his own last summer, Scheer’s Conservatives have vaulted to first place in voting intentions. Over the first quarter of this year, they raised more money than the ruling Liberals. Over the same period, Scheer’s personal ratings have improved while Bernier’s star has faded.

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

Quebec's proposed ban on religious symbols in the workplace is an ""existential type of attack"" that has people feeling like their freedom to express themselves was simply ""an illusion,"" claims a member of a multifaith group opposed to the bill.

""What you're being told is you have to give up who you are, give up your identity. I don't consider that a free choice,"" said Gregory Bordan, an orthodox Jewish lawyer in Montreal who is part of the Coalition Inclusion Quebec.

""Freedom of religion means … you're not forced to put aside your religion in order to participate in society,"" he told The Current's guest host Matt Galloway.

If passed, Bill 21 proposes to stop some civil servants from wearing religious symbols, such as the kippa, turban or hijab on the job. The rules would apply to teachers, police officers and judges, among others.

The Coalition Inclusion Quebec is one of four religious or inter-faith groups voicing their opinions on the bill at ongoing legislative hearings. A total of 36 groups have been invited to testify.

Protecting 'freedom of conscience'

Bordan said the group supports the separation of state and religion, but argued Bill 21 would ""institutionalize discrimination.""

That's not how Diane Guilbault, president of Pour les droits des femmes du Quebec, sees the legislation.

""The bill, at the heart, is to protect the freedom of conscience of the citizens,"" she told Galloway.

When I go to a government service ... I don't want to talk about religion. - Diane Guilbault, president of Pour les droits des femmes du Quebec

When someone wears a sign of their religion, Guilbault explains, they are ""displaying a discourse.""

""When I go to a government service, a public service, I don't want to talk about religion, so I don't want to know what religion the person is,"" she said, adding that symbols carry a great deal of meaning.

But Bordan contends the argument that someone imposes their ideas about religion on another by wearing religious symbols, like a kippa, is a ""fundamental mistake.""

""I don't believe for one moment that Madame Guilbault is going to feel that she has to convert to Judaism because I'm wearing a kippa,"" he said.

The Chinese tech executive at the centre of a high-profile international extradition case is seeking to have her case thrown out.

Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer for Chinese telecom giant Huawei, told the the B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver Wednesday that she is the subject of an abuse of process by border officials, RCMP, the FBI and the government of Canada.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.

She stands accused of violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran by allegedly misrepresenting Huawei’s ownership and control of Skycom, a company doing business in the Middle Eastern country.

Speaking outside the court, Huawei Canada’s vice-president of media affairs Benjamin Howes said the application to toss the case was based on three key arguments.

Howes said Meng had not actually broken sanctions against Iran, as alleged by U.S. authorities, and had been clear and above board about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom.

He further argued that Meng had been the subject of “serious and repeated violations” of her charter rights at the direction of the FBI and at the hands of Canadian authorities.

“The RCMP intentionally delayed the presentation of the arrest warrant in order to carry out the unlawful detention and search against Ms. Meng,” Howes said.

“This was done under the pretense of a routine border check.”

Meng’s legal team will further argue the sanctions on financial services she is accused of violating are not imposed in Canada, meaning the case does not meet the “double criminality” requirement of Canada’s extradition agreement with the U.S., and is therefore not lawful, Howes said.

In court, Meng’s lawyer Scott Fenton also argued that comments by U.S. President Donald Trump prove the case is politically motivated.

The U.S. and China have tried to keep Meng’s case separate from their trade dispute, although Trump has said he would consider intervening in the case if it would help forge a trade deal with Beijing.

Fenton called Trump’s comments “intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law.”

WATCH: Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou back in court

Wednesday’s court appearance also saw Meng granted the right to move to a home she owns in Vancouver’s posh Shaughnessy neighbourhood.

The 46-year-old has been living at another of her two multimillion-dollar Vancouver homes on a $10-million bail. She is also under 24-hour surveillance by a private security company as well as electronic monitoring.

WATCH (March 4, 2019): Does Meng have a strong case against U.S. extradition?

The Canadian government has refused to intervene in the case, citing the rule of law.

While Meng fights her extradition, she has also launched a lawsuit against the federal government, the Canada Border Services Agency and RCMP.

Meng claims Canada violated her constitutional rights when officers detained and questioned her for three hours at Vancouver International Airport before notifying her of her arrest.

The United States is now putting pressure on its British ally to stop the Chinese telecom from establishing a 5G network in the U.K.

Speaking in London, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo invoked the politics of Margaret Thatcher.

“”Ask yourself this: Would the Iron Lady be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption and coercion?,” he said.

“Would she allow China to control the internet of the future?”

Careful not to anger China, the British government would only say that there is no final decision on the matter.

Canada is already facing Beijing’s wrath.

Since Meng’s arrest, two Canadians — ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor — have been detained in China in apparent retaliation.

Trade issues have also become strained with China blocking imports of Canadian pork and canola.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canola-china-trudeau-alberta-saskatchewan-1.5117346,"Thats why he should have shut up and kept a low profile, but no hes got to be woke around the world.",1.0,9.0,"The Trudeau government is expanding a federal loan guarantee program for farmers in response to Western Canada's canola crisis — more than doubling the maximum amount of money available to individual producers.

CBC News has learned the federal government is set to announce at a news conference Wednesday morning a boost to the maximum amount available to individual farmers under the Advance Payments Program (APP), from $400,000 per year to $1 million.

The news comes not long after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised that help for canola farmers would be ""coming out in a few days.""

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr will announce details at a news conference on Parliament Hill at 9:30 a.m. ET and CBCNews.ca will carry it live.

Under the former APP rules, producers could receive up to $400,000 per year in advances based on the value of their crops or livestock, with the federal government paying the interest on the first $100,000.

Producers repay the advances after they sell their product. Cash advanced for most commodities has to be repaid in 18 months; cattle and bison producers get 24 months to pay.

Ottawa is changing the APP rules in response to market turmoil in the canola sector. China has blocked Canadian canola seed from Richardson International and Viterra, two of Canada's biggest exporters, saying that shipments were contaminated with pests.

Other China-bound shipments of Canadian canola have been cancelled, forcing exporters to sell the seed elsewhere at a discount. And Reuters reports more commodities are hitting inspection roadblocks at Chinese ports, leaving exporters to scramble for alternate markets.

Canadian politicians have insisted there is no basis for China's pest claim. China's move is widely seen as an act of retaliation over Canada's decision to arrest Meng Wanzhou, an executive with the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, for extradition to the United States.

""Canadians know, of course, as do people around the world, that Canadian food inspection and the quality of Canadian agriculture and produce is world-class, and the processes we have cannot be beaten anywhere in the world,"" Trudeau told a media event Monday morning.

While the move is being driven by the plight of canola growers, the revised APP program is available to all farmers. For canola farmers, however, the federal government is increasing the interest-free portion of the cash advances to $500,000.

Prime Minister Trudeau is expected to call premiers tonight to fill them in on the new APP rules.

Meanwhile, the Trudeau government is trying to go to the source to end China's trade action. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau recently sent a formal request to Beijing for permission to send Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials to China to personally inspect Canadian canola shipments for pests.

Sources tell CBC News that while Chinese officials have been talking positively about the trade relationship with Canada and their desire to solve the canola spat, they've yet to give the CFIA permission to send its own inspectors to China. The sources said the federal government isn't viewing China's stance as an outright rejection of its proposal and plans to keep pushing the idea with Beijing.

Meanwhile, Ottawa continues to search for new markets for Canadian canola. International Trade Minister Jim Carr is expected to lead a trade mission to locate buyers beyond the Chinese market but the government isn't sharing details at this point."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/afterlife-obituary-class-action-lawsuit-1.5119601,Wow that's a poorly written headline,20.0,154.0,"Afterlife violated the copyrighted work of grieving families in order to make a profit, a judge in Ottawa ruled in ordering damages to be paid in a class-action lawsuit.

The lawsuit was filed in Federal Court in Ottawa by Newfoundland lawyer Erin Best on behalf of client Dawn Thomson, who was shocked to find her father's obituary on the website.

""Afterlife's conduct, aptly characterized as 'obituary piracy,' is high-handed, reprehensible and represented a marked departure from standards of decency,"" wrote Justice Catherine Kane.

Afterlife effectively copied and pasted obituaries and photographs that had been published elsewhere, and passed the content off as its own.

It was like someone had ripped my chest out again. - Raylene Manning-Puddister, grieving mom

It outraged families by selling memorial-themed products like candles and sympathy cards that unwitting friends and family could purchase — but with all the revenue going to Afterlife.

She ordered Afterlife — run by Pascal Leclerc — to pay $20 million in damages, and an injunction against the website to prevent it from operating in the future.

Leclerc initially hired a lawyer to handle his defence, but eventually backed out of the proceedings, leading to Kane issuing a default judgment.

Shock and disgust

Thomson's father, Denis Trainor, passed away in early 2017. A year later, she saw his obituary posted on Afterlife's website, where people could pay for things like digital flowers and candles.

""Ms. Thomson described her outrage and mortification that others would think she sought to profit from her father's death,"" wrote Kane.

While Thomson was the face case for the class action, the lawsuit was launched after events set in motion by a different grieving Newfoundlander.

Raylene Puddister was outraged when her young son's obituary appeared on the Afterlife website without her permission. (CBC)

Raylene Manning-Puddister was sitting at home one morning when she went to Google her son's baseball stats.

Although she has them memorized, she said, ""being a bereaved mom, it's just a dark road you walk every day of your life.""

Instead, she found his obituary as one of the top hits.

It was the same one she had written in 2012, when her 22-year-old-son, Tyller Pittman, passed away. To her surprise, it was posted on a site she had never seen before.

You would have a heart of stone if you were not moved by these people. - Erin Best, lawyer

""His obituary was literally word for word. The same pictures. There wasn't even any change in what I wrote myself.""

Afterlife had even used a poem Manning-Puddister had written for her son, placed alongside paid advertising and options to purchase digital tokens of sympathy.

""It was like someone had ripped my chest out again. I felt like I'd literally gotten kicked in the stomach,"" she said. ""Who in the world would do something so horrific to take advantage of bereaved parents, of people that lost their parents?""

Manning-Puddister called into CBC's St. John's Morning Show, where she shared her story and questioned how it was legal.

CBC then called Best to weigh in on whether it was copyright infringement. She later decided to file a lawsuit.

'They were absolutely devastated'

In her ruling, Kane said the site had infringed on copyrights by lifting the obituaries and photos of the deceased from other websites.

She awarded $10 million in statutory damages and $10 million in aggravated damages.

Best said once she announced she was filing a suit, she was bombarded with people who were furious, hurt, shocked and disgusted by Afterlife.

Lawyer Erin Best says families at their most vulnerable were devastated to find obituaries and photos of their loved ones on the Afterlife website. (Photo courtesy Paul Kinsman)

""You would have a heart of stone if you were not moved by these people,"" she said. ""They were absolutely devastated ... they felt like it was a kick in the stomach at their most vulnerable time.""

Whether any of the plaintiffs will see any money remains to be seen, Best said.

The site had posted more than one million Canadian obituaries at the time it was taken down. Afterlife now directs people to another website, Everhere, which the judge said is also run by Leclerc.

Everhere drew ire in Saskatchewan last year when families of victims of the Humboldt Broncos crash learned it was selling similar products without their permission.

Kane requested the injunction should name Leclerc personally, so he cannot continue posting obituaries on Everhere.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-secularism-hearing-day-1-1.5125929,why would we make a law targeting people who cover their faces for religious reasons when there's no law against covering your face just because it's cold or it's Halloween or because you feel ugly,-1.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Djemila Benhabib, representing the Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité, said Tuesday that some Muslim women who wear the hijab are 'fundamentalists.' (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

Another government could be added to the tally if Dwight Ball's Liberals fail to secure re-election in today's vote in Newfoundland and Labrador — a defeat that would make Trudeau's term in office the bloodiest for an incumbent government in Canadian history.

Trudeau benefited from a widespread desire for change in the October 2015 election. Since then, there have been nine changes of government in the 11 provincial and territorial elections that have been held during the last four years. (Nunavut and the Northwest Territories do not run elections along party lines, and so have been excluded from this analysis.)

Newfoundland and Labrador was the first out of the gate in November 2015, when Ball's Liberals defeated the incumbent Progressive Conservatives. In 2016, Brian Pallister's PCs beat the NDP in Manitoba and Sandy Silver's Liberals defeated the Yukon Party.

In 2017, Christy Clark's B.C. Liberals won the most seats but were replaced by John Horgan's New Democrats with the backing of the B.C. Greens. Last year, Liberal governments in Ontario, New Brunswick and Quebec were replaced by the PCs and François Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec.

Already this year, Rachel Notley's New Democrats fell to Jason Kenney's United Conservatives in Alberta, while Wade MacLauchlan's Liberals were defeated by the PCs under Dennis King in Prince Edward Island.

Only the Saskatchewan Party in 2016 and Stephen McNeil's Nova Scotia Liberals in 2017 have managed to win re-election over the last four years.

An unusual pace of change

So much turnover in such a short period of time is rare. Trudeau's term is only the fourth in Canadian history which saw a majority of provincial elections result in changes of government. The others were those of W.L. Mackenzie King (between 1921 and 1925), Pierre Trudeau (between 1968 and 1972) and R.B. Bennett's single term in power between 1930 and 1935.

Bennett's name is one that Trudeau drops a lot. He has evoked the former Conservative prime minister 19 times in the House of Commons (according to openparliament.ca) to remind the current Conservatives that it was Stephen Harper who had the ""lowest growth record"" since the market crash of 1929 that sparked the Great Depression.

Harper is the only prime minister whose name Trudeau has uttered more often than Bennett's in the Commons. But Trudeau has his own connection to Bennett — one that does not bode well for his chances in the fall election.

Defeat in the Great Depression

Ten provincial elections were held during Bennett's time as prime minister. Incumbent governments lost eight of them, which was the worst winning record for incumbents in history — until the last four years.

The early 1930s were a time of tremendous political disruption, in Canada and around the world. King's Liberals met defeat in the 1930 election in part because of the turmoil triggered by the market crash of the preceding year.

Newly installed as prime minister, Bennett's popularity quickly dropped as his government failed to grapple with the country's rampant unemployment. When he finally went to the polls in 1935, his party lost more than two-thirds of its seats and King's Liberals were returned to power. The Liberals would stay there for another 22 years.

But Bennett's government wasn't the only one to be sideswiped by the Great Depression.

In 1931, the Liberals were defeated in P.E.I., only to be returned to power four years later with every seat in the assembly after the Conservatives failed to do a better job of tackling the upheaval.

In 1933, the Conservatives fell to the Liberals in Nova Scotia and in British Columbia.

The next year, the Liberals' James Gardiner returned to office in Saskatchewan, replacing the coalition government that brought him down after the 1929 election produced a minority legislature. In Ontario, Mitch Hepburn's Liberals beat the Conservatives, who had been in office for the preceding decade.

Before the federal election in 1935 was held, the Liberals saw off the Conservatives in New Brunswick and ""Bible Bill"" Aberhart's Social Credit, which proposed radical new monetary policies that were later deemed unconstitutional, was swept to power in Alberta. The incumbent United Farmers were shut out of the Alberta legislature entirely.

It was in this context of turmoil and disruption that Bennett met his political end in October of that year.

The lessons from history

There is no clear relationship between change in provincial capitals and change in Ottawa. In cases where an incumbent government has been defeated in the past, about 32 per cent of incumbent provincial governments changed hands prior. The turnover rate at the provincial level has been about 29 per cent at times when federal governments have been re-elected — slightly lower, but not significantly so.

Though Bennett met a catastrophic defeat when the desire for change was sweeping the nation, King won enough seats in 1925 to stay in power with a minority government. In 1972, Pierre Trudeau eked out a slim plurality and also stayed in office at the head of a minority government.

During Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's first term in office between 1968 and 1972, a majority of incumbent provincial governments were defeated. Trudeau's Liberals were reduced to a minority in the 1972 federal election. R.B. Bennett was prime minister from 1930 to 1935 during the Great Depression, when voters were defeating incumbent provincial governments across the country. (Peter Bregg/Canadian Press)

On the other hand, a number of prime ministers have met defeat after their provincial counterparts were re-elected.

But it might still worry Justin Trudeau that the country is on pace to match the provincial turnover rate of the Bennett years. Bennett was the last prime minister to be elected to office for the first time at the head of a majority government who was subsequently booted out in the next election. Trudeau wants to avoid being the next one.

And as with the Bennett years, parties that share the prime minister's brand are the ones that are suffering most of the defeats. It will be six Liberal governments down if Ball is defeated today, matching Bennett's record.

Of course, Canada's economy is not now in the depths of a Great Depression. Unemployment currently stands at 5.7 per cent, while estimates put unemployment almost as high as 30 per cent during the Depression. But some of the former premiers who have recently become unemployed themselves — Philippe Couillard in Quebec, for example — were canned despite healthy provincial economies.

In short, we appear to be living through a Great Disruption in Canadian politics. It might not be over yet.

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

Claire Avery, a rugby player at Charles P. Allen High School, said she and her teammates were shocked and devastated by the news.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Brooklyn Peyton, who plays rugby for Lockview High School in Fall River, hoped she would go to university on a rugby scholarship.

She said she's blown away by news of the cancellation.

'I just love the team'

""I started with this team, it's important to me, they are like family,"" she said. ""My coach means a lot to me. He's kind of like my second dad ... I just love the team.""

She and other rugby players at Lockview plan to wear their jerseys to school Friday and play some informal games on the school field to show support for the team.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the group has asked to meet with the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation about the decision to cancel school rugby. (CBC)

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-wage-minimum-stampede-1.5152976,"""Offers flexibility in wages"" smh.",2.0,14.0,"The Calgary Stampede is one of the biggest seasonal employers for youth in the province — and Alberta's new minimum wage changes give both the Stampede and its new hires only a few weeks to sort out what teens' paycheques will look like.

""Because this just happened yesterday, we're at a point now where we have to take a look at everything,"" said Jennifer Booth, manager of public relations for the Calgary Stampede.

Bill 2, also called the Open for Business Act, set a new $13-an-hour minimum wage for youth when it was introduced Monday, down from $15 an hour. The new youth minimum wage takes effect on June 26.

The Stampede hires about 3,500 people every July, about 500 of whom are under 18. So far, Booth says, about 50 per cent of its positions have been filled.

It runs July 5 to 14, and now just weeks out, the Stampede has to determine how much it will be paying those youth workers — those who have already signed contracts and those who have yet to be hired.

I wonder if this could be shortsighted because the next election, these youth will be voting. - Leanne Shirtliffe, mom of 15-year-old Vivian Hughes

Leanne Shirtliffe says her daughter Vivian Hughes qualified for an interview at the Stampede's hiring fair, and she had already started to budget the money she expected to earn when she heard the news that she might earn less than expected.

""She's quite disappointed,"" Shirtliffe said. ""She's starting a strong academic program in high school … she doesn't want to work when that happens so she was really hoping to save.""

The lower wage will also apply to students under the age of 18 who work 28 hours a week or less while school is in session. It will also apply for all hours worked during summer holidays, Christmas and other school breaks.

Changing wage could breach contract: lawyer

Labour relations lawyer Will Cascadden says what the Stampede can do depends on the type of contract youth workers signed before the law changed.

""If they've already hired people and they've said we're going to pay you X, and then they say, 'well, we've changed our mind, we're going to pay you less than X,' that could be a breach of contract,"" he said.

""For them to change that, they'd have to address it from a contract law perspective … it probably wouldn't be very smooth because they'd have to change the deal, but there's ways they could probably do it.""

Cascadden says the teens could fight an imposed lower wage in court, but it might not be practical for a loss of $2 per hour during the 10-day event.

He says he sees the problem being more about public relations than employment law.

Vivian Hughes is disappointed she may not be earning as much as she hoped this summer. (Submitted by Leanne Shirtliffe)

""You're going to … unilaterally reduce all their wages a month before they're supposed to start working — it may not be a very popular decision,"" he said.

Booth says the Stampede jobs that youth are hired for are mostly entry level, ranging from greeting attendees, to ushering, to serving food.

""We're really proud to be a lot of youths' first job in the community,"" she said. ""Our team is really just evaluating what this means.""

Bill 2 also changes the Employment Standards Code so that employees must work 30 days before being entitled to holiday pay.

Also, workers will receive holiday pay only for days they would normally be scheduled to work — for example, a restaurant that is normally closed on Mondays wouldn't have to give its staff holiday pay for Thanksgiving.

Richard Truscott, a vice-president with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), says the changes could be a positive thing.

""Our members, who are the small business owners across the province, generally support that. They believe that more flexibility on wage rates for employers is a good thing,"" he said.

""And it's going to allow more young people to get their foot in the door and get those entry-level jobs because they're less expensive for employers to create in the first place.""

But Shirtliffe says, as the mom of a teen, she feels conflicted over the changes.

""The question is if teens will think they're not as valuable as workers. However, that said, if it encourages more people to hire teens, that could be a good thing,"" she said.

""I wonder if this could be shortsighted because the next election, these youth will be voting."""

The physics don't even work. 

This cold war 2.0 bullshit is getting ridiculous.",-8.0,9.0,"OTTAWA–Andrew Scheer will announce tomorrow that a Conservative government would start talks with the Trump administration to join the U.S. continental missile defence program, the Star has learned.

While the U.S. has sought the Canadian government’s co-operation on a missile defence program since the early 2000s, successive governments — both Liberal and Conservative — have refused.

But two Conservative sources, who were not authorized to speak on the record, confirmed Scheer will announce a future Conservative government would pursue joining the program, which seeks to detect and stop missile attacks on the U.S. and its allies.

Scheer will also announce his party’s desire to “modernize” NORAD, the joint Canada-U.S. aerospace defence system, one source who had seen the text of the speech said.

The announcements will come as part of a speech Scheer is scheduled to deliver Tuesday in Montreal on the Conservatives’ approach to foreign policy. The speech is the first of five policy speeches Scheer is slated to deliver over the next five weeks.

Scheer has released little in terms of policy since winning the Conservative leadership in May 2017, leading to Liberal attacks that he doesn’t have a plan, especially on the environment.

What led Canada’s Conservatives to turn against carbon taxes?

The speeches could blunt that criticism, while giving voters a better sense of what the Conservatives expect to include in their election platform. In addition to foreign affairs, Scheer will deliver speeches on immigration, the economy, “confederation” and the environment.

The issue of a ballistic missile defence treaty with the United States has been a contentious one for successive Canadian governments. In 2005, then-prime minister Paul Martin refused to sign a deal with the Bush administration. Stephen Harper rebuffed similar requests from president Barack Obama, and the current Liberal government was similarly cold to the idea in its recently released defence policy overhaul.

“The threats facing North America have evolved significantly in the air and maritime environment … and weapons technology, including ballistic and cruise missiles, has advanced tremendously,” the defence framework reads.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

“Canada’s policy with respect to participation in ballistic missile defence has not changed. However, we intend to engage the United States to look broadly at emerging threats and perils to North America, across all domains, as part of NORAD modernization.”

Canadian governments’ reluctance to join the American missile defence shield has typically had more to do with domestic politics than national security or defence considerations, according to Eugene Lang, an adjunct professor at the Queen’s University school of policy studies.

“There’s been a lot of political sensitivity around it for Canadian governments that were feeling it was going to be controversial for Canada to sign on to this thing,” said Lang, who served as chief of staff to two Liberal defence ministers.

“That was certainly the case in the early 2000s with the Bush administration because the Bush administration’s foreign and military policy was deeply unpopular in Canada. Now the Trump administration’s military and security policy, I don’t know if it’s deeply unpopular (but) we know Trump is deeply unpopular.”

Whoever wins the upcoming federal election will likely face increased pressure from the Trump administration to participate — and help pay for — a planned update of the U.S. ballistic missile defence system.

In January, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will deploy a new space-based system for detecting and stopping ballistic missiles aimed at the U.S. and its allies. But Trump also said that the allies who benefit from that defence system will be expected to pay their share of the cost.

Obviously my work computer and work phone password would not be shared, they can keep it and it would immediately be reported and treated as if it was stolen / lost. That means all passwords changed immediately and the little of everything else actually on the computer is encrypted with a  number of protections in place so hopefully nothing would be compromised.

This is serious shit though and good for someone taking this on. I would like to hear what Trudeau thinks about this? (Of course he doesnt care)",1.0,19.0,"As more people travel with smartphones loaded with personal data, concern is mounting over Canadian border officers' powers to search those phones — without a warrant.

""The policy's outrageous,"" said Toronto business lawyer, Nick Wright. ""I think that it's a breach of our constitutional rights.""

His thoughts follow a personal experience. After landing at Toronto's Pearson Airport on April 10, he said the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) flagged him for an additional inspection — for no stated reason.

Wright had just returned from a four-month trip to Guatemala and Colombia where he studied Spanish and worked remotely. He took no issue when a border services officer searched his bags, but drew the line when the officer demanded his passwords to also search his phone and laptop.

Wright refused, telling the officer both devices contained confidential information protected by solicitor-client privilege.

He said the officer then confiscated his phone and laptop, and told him the items would be sent to a government lab which would try to crack his passwords and search his files.

Nick Wright poses with his Spanish instructor, Nicks Rocche Chavajay, in San Pedro La Laguna, Guatemala. (submitted by Nick Wright)

""In my view, seizing devices when someone exercises their constitutional right is an affront to civil liberty,"" said Wright who's still waiting for the return of his phone and laptop. Meanwhile, he said he has spent about $3,000 to replace them.

Officers can search your phone

According to the CBSA, it has the right to search electronic devices at the border for evidence of customs-related offences — without a warrant — just as it does with luggage.

If travellers refuse to provide their passwords, officers can seize their devices.

The CBSA said that between November 2017 and March 2019, 19,515 travellers had their digital devices examined, which represents 0.015 per cent of all cross-border travellers during that period.

During 38 per cent of those searches, officers uncovered evidence of a customs-related offence — which can include possessing prohibited material or undeclared goods, and money laundering, said the agency.

According to the Canada Border Services Agency, its officers have the right to search any goods crossing the border without a warrant -- including electronic devices. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)

While the laws governing CBSA searches have existed for decades, applying them to digital devices has sparked concern in an era where many travellers carry smartphones full of personal and sometimes very sensitive data.

A growing number of lawyers across Canada argue that warrantless digital device searches at the border are unconstitutional, and the practice should be stopped or at least limited.

""The policy of the CBSA of searching devices isn't something that is justifiable in a free and democratic society,"" said Wright who ran as a Green Party candidate in the 2015 federal election.

""It's appalling, it's shocking, and I hope that government, government agencies and the courts, and individual citizens will inform themselves and take action.""

'Out of date' laws

Consumer advocacy group, OpenMedia is already taking action. It has launched an online and ad campaign to raise awareness about digital border searches and pressure the federal government to update the rules that govern them.

""These laws are incredibly, incredibly out of date,"" said OpenMedia privacy campaigner Victoria Henry. ""The way they treat our digital devices are as mere goods and that's the same classification as a bag of T-shirts.""

She wants to see separate border rules for digital devices which stipulate reasonable grounds for a search. Henry also said those rules must be clearly laid out to the public.

""We need to have clear and transparent policies and mechanisms for recourse.""

The federal government says that its current policies are both reasonable and necessary to keep Canadian borders secure.

CBSA officers are directed to disable any internet connection and only examine content that is already stored on a device, said Scott Bardsley, spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, in an email.

He also said that digital searches ""should not be routine"" and that ""officers may only conduct a search if there are multiple indicators that evidence of contraventions may be found on a device.""

Wright said, in his case, no rationale was provided why his phone and laptop needed to be examined.

""There were no factors that I'm aware of that would justify the searches.""

'Respect for privacy'

Public Safety spokesperson Bardsley also said that CBSA officers understand the importance of solicitor-client privilege and are instructed not to examine documents that fall within that scope.

""CBSA officers are trained to conduct all border examinations with as much respect for privacy as possible.""

Wright said that wasn't his experience. Instead, the officer he dealt with neither expressed knowledge of, nor responded to his concerns that his laptop and phone contained solicitor-client privileged documents, he said.

""His response was only to demand the passwords to access both.""

Bardsley said that if travellers have issues or concerns, they can submit a complaint to the CBSA. He added that the government is investing $24 million to enhance oversight by creating an independent review body for the agency.

Wright has already submitted his complaint to the CBSA which includes a demand for the immediate return of his phone and laptop, plus compensation for having to temporarily replace them.

If and when he gets them back, his battle may not be over; Wright is now considering legal action.

""I think it's important that we all stand up for our civil liberties and our charter rights,"" he said.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-defence-committee-1.5138975,"Trudeau publicly stated that Norman would be charged during a press conference a year before charges were actually laid.

If you're the PM, you can't decide someone did a crime and then try to fabricate evidence.

Also, it is not up to the PM to decide who will and who won't be charged, and you can't charge someone with a crime just because you don't like them.",11.0,163.0,"The Liberal-dominated House of Commons defence committee has blocked a pitch by opposition MPs for a committee probe of the criminal case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

The Conservatives and New Democrats wanted to conduct hearings to determine how the case against the military's former second-in-command collapsed, and what led to him being charged with breach of trust in the first place.

The Crown withdrew the charge on May 8 — over two years after Norman was publicly named and then later formally accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million contract to lease a supply ship for the navy.

The motion to study the Norman case was defeated this evening, after the Liberal MPs who form the majority on the committee said they were not convinced by almost two hours hours of opposition arguments.

While acknowledging questions still linger about the case, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen said the committee was not the appropriate forum to investigate the factors that led to the country's second most powerful military officer being hauled into court.

""It is not the job of the committee to re-examine information that has been examined by independent agencies,"" he said, referring to the public prosecution service and the RCMP.

The Crown conceded when it dropped the charge against Norman that it did not have all of the information when it laid the charge. Mounties acknowledged in an interview with The Canadian Press news agency that they had not seen the new evidence presented by the defence.

Gerretsen, however, said that asking the committee to investigate what went wrong would amount to ""re-litigating"" the matter. He ducked the question of whether there should be an independent investigation or review.

Other Liberals on the committee seemed not the least bit curious about what went wrong and focused their attention on attacking opposition claims of political interference in the prosecution.

Liberal MP Sherry Romando, a former member of the military who was not a voting member of the committee, described the notion as ""spin.""

Her colleague, MP Julie Dzerowicz, went even further, dismissing the call for hearings as a ""fabricated political exercise.""

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison tried to salvage the investigation by proposing that the committee invite only Norman to tell his story — a suggestion that was voted down.

One Liberal MP said if Norman wrote to the committee expressing a desire to testify, that could be something the committee could consider — a position dismissed as disingenuous by the Conservatives.

""There was a lot of Liberal double-speak,"" said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. ""At no point in time were they going to allow Vice Admiral Norman to actually speak.""

Former Conservative cabinet minister Erin O'Toole said that, as a serving military officer, it should not be up to Norman ""to insert himself politically"" — essentially prompting MPs to do the job they were elected to do.

MPs had planned to call Trudeau to testify

The opposition MPs had hoped the hearings would substantiate allegations that the Liberal government politically interfered in the prosecution. Aside from Norman, they wanted to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and a host of other high-profile Liberals.

Legal experts have said that the best chance of hearing Norman's unfiltered version of events would have been to bring him before a parliamentary committee, which grants extraordinary privilege and latitude to those summoned to testify.

While still a serving member of the military, Norman is subject to military regulations that limit his public statements.

When Norman was charged, the Crown alleged he had leaked the results of a Liberal cabinet committee meeting to a now-former CBC journalist. They also also claimed he had provided secret information on 11 other occasions to an executive at the Davie Shipyard in Levis, Que., which was involved in the leasing contract.

His lawyer Marie Henein fought a six-month battle for access to federal government documents needed to defend the former navy commander.

In addition to her claim that the government interfered politically in her client's case, Henein alleged the government obstructed disclosure of the documents.

The case ultimately unravelled after the defence presented new evidence to the Crown, including interviews with key individuals who had not been interviewed by the RCMP.

The Mounties released a statement last week defending their handling of the case and — as late as Monday — had turned aside further requests for comment."

It's the one they have the most control over. Municipalities can't make you reduce, nor reuse. They are only in control of what goes into their landfill. A lot of recycling is better described as ""landfill diversion"". If it goes for recycling, it's not taking up room in the landfill, or contaminating the local land/water. If it's poorly managed, it might be contaminating someone else's water, but again that's not really under the municipality's direct control.",2.0,134.0,"For the second time in five weeks, an angry government in Asia is demanding Canada take back unwanted waste.

First it was the Philippines — now Malaysia .

Many Canadians have been surprised — and unhappy — to learn that Canada sends vast amounts of its recyclable waste overseas.

They've been dutifully putting their plastic, glass and paper into the blue bin, believing they are doing the right thing for the environment. But the recycling process can be complicated, and the outcome isn't always as green as we might think.

What happens to what I put in the blue bin?

According to Myra Hird of the School of Environmental Studies at Queen's University, we don't really know.

""People think that when they put something in their recycling bin, it's actually going to be recycled. But this is not the case.""

She said the waste might be recycled, but everything depends on market value. (More on that later.)

You may be tossing your recyclables into a blue bin supplied by a municipal recycling program, but the municipal government's responsibility ends once the blue bin contents are sold to a recycling company. Waste and recycling is for the most part handled by private industry in Canada.

Canadian recycling companies take the material from municipal programs and sort it, clean it and compress it into smaller cubes. Those cubes are then put up for auction.

""[Municipalities] are only responsible for that first contract,"" said Hird. They need to know where the recycling and the waste first goes. After that, they're not responsible for knowing the rest of that chain.""

Recycling is a ritual in a lot of Canadian homes, and we do it with the best intentions. But intentions in our kitchens may not be good enough. Media ID: 2:20

Who buys it?

It might be bought by a Canadian company that will further process it into pellets that are sold to the plastics industry to be used in new products — such as pipes or plastic bags.

But it could also be bought by a recycling broker who will sell it again — often to companies overseas who seek to make a profit from it. All perfectly legal. But, said Hird, hard to follow.

""These brokers mean that these contracts can change hands several times between the source and the destination."" And, she said, there is no accountability.

For years, China was a huge market for the developed world's plastic waste, taking in about 45 per cent of the world's plastics waste since 1992 . But last year, China announced it no longer wants it. Canada, and other countries, needed to find new markets.

How is Canadian plastic waste ending up in Asian countries?

""We don't like to keep our waste around,"" said Hird, ""so we move it between regions. We transport waste to the United States, to South Korea, to obviously, Malaysia, the Philippines and elsewhere.""

And while companies in those countries may be willing to buy it, governments in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam started to crack down late last year — imposing bans and stricter regulations.

Companies buy recyclable waste, because they can make money on it. This is where market value comes in. But recycling, said Hird, is not a stable industry.

""Something that we put in the recycling bin in January … that may get recycled if there's value in it, if there's a market in it."" But if there's no market, she said, then by November or December, that same material might be put in landfill because there's no longer a significant profit to be made.

What's more, said Martin Vogt, president of Ontario-based company EFS-plastics, overseas companies do not always recycle all of what we send. ""They're picking out the good plastics, and that plastic will be recycled. But most of it ends up in the oceans, in landfills … and sometimes it's burned.""

How much does Canada recycle itself?

Much less than you might think.

""Canada recycles only nine per cent of the plastic that we use here in this country,"" according to Keith Brooks of Environment Defence.

And Hird cautions that Canadians are not made aware of the costs of recycling. ""Recycling means changing that material, which often involves significant transportation.""

She uses an example of polystyrene — a standard, versatile foam plastic used to make everything from food containers to protective packaging — that is collected in Kingston.

""[It] gets shipped to northern Ontario using trucks that use non-renewable fossil fuels. It's then liquefied and made smaller, more compact, and then it's put on more trucks which are then taken to Montreal, which then are put on ships that go to the United States and go to South Korea. All of this for one more use for that polystyrene.""

So is recycling in Canada working?

According to Brooks, not really.

""We need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use. That means banning some plastic [by] the government. We need to hold producers responsible for this plastic ultimately — that's a really important thing. And we need government to take action to do that.

In British Columbia, legislation shifted the onus of handling recycling onto the businesses that create the waste, something known as ""extended producer responsibility."" Recycle B.C, a non-profit, took responsibility for the province's waste recycling about five years ago. It works to keep contamination levels low, so its recycled products are usually higher quality, making them easier to sell.

And Recycle B.C. spokesperson David Lefebvre told CBC News in April,""all of the plastic that's collected here in the province ends up here in B.C.""

There are calls for the Canadian government to create a stronger end market for recyclables, by making it mandatory for manufacturers to use a certain amount of recycled material in new products. (CBC News)

Is there a solution?

Vogt agrees the solution requires government involvement, but had a different take than Brooks.

He said governments need to, ""come out and say we need to have recycled content in our products in order to create the circle economy and basically get the industry going.""

But Brooks and Hird both say the real solution lies in reducing all waste, not relying on recycling."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/flood-plains-1.5135336,That’s so bizarre because I had Wawanesa and it was excluded.  I wonder if they don’t offer it in areas that are more risky.  Good info to share!,4.0,109.0,"Note to outraged conservative readers: this opinion column was not assigned by Katie Telford. (The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

So you're confirming everything I've said. Thank you. Also, it's a little disingenuous to quote the gross debt. Just quote net.

&gt;TIL socialism just means ""welfare"", as if Corporate ""Welfare"" isn't just taxpayers picking up the tab so the ""job creators"" can pay less tax. Taxpayers ALSO PAY FOR CORPORATE WELFARE, which might take the form of deregulation (environmental, workers rights, etc), stagnant minimum wages, etc. And please spare me the rediculous argument that regulation or higher corporate taxes just means businesses will simply leave Canada. That's never been the case, and is hilariously when people propose that.

You need to calm down, take a breather, and learn to spell. 

Corporate welfare is no more good than any other kind of welfare. We agree on something, perhaps. It also has nothing to do with my argument.

&gt;Looks like you are the one who should take an economics course if you are naive enough to think that ""government spending bad"" or that increasing government spending is a direct correlation to an increase in gross federal debt.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

Not really, those of us outside the bubble can see the inherent threats and associated violence.

Everyone else recognizes that the hijab is discriminatory and inherently violent, except the people desperate to keep people wearing them...",4.0,96.0,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

Michael Chertoff has a warning for Canada about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Canada's federal government is currently deciding whether Huawei can be trusted to build the next generation of Internet infrastructure across the country.

Chertoff, who was the United States' homeland security secretary under former president George W. Bush, says that decision could have major consequences for Canada's relationships with both China and the United States.

Meanwhile, Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is due to appear in a Vancouver court where a judge will consider an extradition request from the United States.

Here is part of Chertoff's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.

Mr. Chertoff, how is the United States likely to respond if Justin Trudeau agrees to allow Huawei 5G network to be a principal part of our system?

I think it's going to raise concerns about the security of your system.

We've seen stories recently, in fact, involving more back doors or problems with Chinese software and hardware.

So that's going to create some obstacles to the ability to rapidly share data because they're concerned that there'll be a compromise.

Chertoff cautions Canadians to reconsider pursuing a 5G network deal with Chinese tech giant Huawei. (Reuters)

You know that China says that Huawei is a private company — that the Chinese government is not involved with it and that there are firewalls that would protect these networks from any kind of Chinese influence. What does the United States think of that?

I think most Americans are skeptical of that for a number of reasons.

First of all, the Chinese clearly anoint certain companies as champions and support them.

And if you just look at what happened recently, with respect to Canadians being arrested in China as retaliation for the arrest of a senior Huawei official, it suggests a degree of solicitude for the company by the Chinese government that is is not consistent with the idea that they're independent.

To could give the Chinese the ability to occupy a pivotal part of your infrastructure, one that will be, as I say, the commanding heights of the next 10 or 20 years of the economy, you're giving them enormous leverage in any dispute.

You're giving them a surface area for which they can potentially take intellectual property or otherwise compromise confidential material and you have to, I think, seriously view China as a rival, if not an adversary.

The U.S. is seeking the extradition of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, but Canada appears to be bearing the brunt of China's displeasure in a situation that blurs the lines between politics and justice. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

What could they potentially do?

Well, they could either find or embed pathways in to compromise networks and allow the theft of intellectual property.

They could introduce disruption or latency into the network because it's not just the hardware and software that you first install. It's all of the updates, the patches, everything you do to them to tend to and monitor the system going forward.

It's not just a question of taking data and either misusing it or stealing intellectual property. This will actually be part of the mechanism that controls your industrial control systems and your operating systems.

So the person who dominates that, in a way, has the ability to affect everything from your power grid to your air traffic control system to your even your sensitive national security infrastructure.

The Canadian government is deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention of two Canadians in China. Read my statement: <a href=""https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc"">https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc</a> —@cafreeland

As you mentioned, we have two Canadians who are detained in China, held in isolation. Two others on death row. In other matters, our trade is being deeply effected as the Chinese shut us out of the markets. All this because of this extradition request from your country for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meanwhile, your president is busy securing a comprehensive free trade agreement with China and moving ahead and benefiting. So do you understand why Canadians might feel like we're being played here?

Well, I don't think that's a fair inference. Look, I think there are a couple of different things.

First of all, I mean obviously the security relationship the U.S. and Canada have is a very strong one. We're allies and I don't think anybody believes the U.S. is an ally of China — nor is it clear to me what's going to come out of this trade agreement.

I think what actually is demonstrated by Chinese behaviour is that when you're touching on what they view as one of their national champions, they will use any leverage they have to punish you.

And that ought to cause people to ask the question: well geez, if we give them the keys to the kingdom on our 5G network, what will they do if they don't like something we do in the future?

But wait a second. We arrested Meng Wanzhou at your behest, at your government's behest, and we're being punished while you move ahead with getting the trade deals that we're shut out of now. So I guess the question is, you know, at some point this seems rather unfair to us.

First of all, I don't know whether the Chinese aren't going to try to punish the U.S.

But if you're asking me why the Chinese decided they were going to focus on Canada in retaliating, I think it suggests they're trying to bully Canada and it may be that they feel they can get away with it more with Canada or that they can intervene before the extradition gets done.

Well, maybe the United States should start pushing back at our behest a bit.

I think we may see some further developments. I would not describe your relationship between China and the U.S. as a warm and fuzzy relationship.

There are a lot of different deals going on but I would be very careful not to have the Chinese try to drive a wedge between the Canadians and the Americans, by making it seem as if they're picking on one and not on the other.

Well, President Trump has said that he may trade Meng Wanzhou for getting his trade deals. So, maybe we're being played by your country as well.

I don't know what you're referring to and I don't read Twitter as a map for what's going to happen.

I would not presume anybody knows what's going to be the next step in all this because there are a lot of balls in the air.

Is it not true that President Trump suggested that he could exchange Meng Wanzhou for a trade deal with China?

He often says all kinds of different things, which never come to pass. So I'm not going to speculate as to what was in his head. But I'm not going to presume that this has any realistic prospect of happening.

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

Liberal MPP Michael Coteau tabled a private member's bill that was voted down in early May. (CBC)

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/waste-recyclables-malaysia-philippines-cbc-explains-1.5153399,"Reduce, reuse, and recycle. The order matters here.",22.0,134.0,"For the second time in five weeks, an angry government in Asia is demanding Canada take back unwanted waste.

First it was the Philippines — now Malaysia .

Many Canadians have been surprised — and unhappy — to learn that Canada sends vast amounts of its recyclable waste overseas.

They've been dutifully putting their plastic, glass and paper into the blue bin, believing they are doing the right thing for the environment. But the recycling process can be complicated, and the outcome isn't always as green as we might think.

What happens to what I put in the blue bin?

According to Myra Hird of the School of Environmental Studies at Queen's University, we don't really know.

""People think that when they put something in their recycling bin, it's actually going to be recycled. But this is not the case.""

She said the waste might be recycled, but everything depends on market value. (More on that later.)

You may be tossing your recyclables into a blue bin supplied by a municipal recycling program, but the municipal government's responsibility ends once the blue bin contents are sold to a recycling company. Waste and recycling is for the most part handled by private industry in Canada.

Canadian recycling companies take the material from municipal programs and sort it, clean it and compress it into smaller cubes. Those cubes are then put up for auction.

""[Municipalities] are only responsible for that first contract,"" said Hird. They need to know where the recycling and the waste first goes. After that, they're not responsible for knowing the rest of that chain.""

Recycling is a ritual in a lot of Canadian homes, and we do it with the best intentions. But intentions in our kitchens may not be good enough. Media ID: 2:20

Who buys it?

It might be bought by a Canadian company that will further process it into pellets that are sold to the plastics industry to be used in new products — such as pipes or plastic bags.

But it could also be bought by a recycling broker who will sell it again — often to companies overseas who seek to make a profit from it. All perfectly legal. But, said Hird, hard to follow.

""These brokers mean that these contracts can change hands several times between the source and the destination."" And, she said, there is no accountability.

For years, China was a huge market for the developed world's plastic waste, taking in about 45 per cent of the world's plastics waste since 1992 . But last year, China announced it no longer wants it. Canada, and other countries, needed to find new markets.

How is Canadian plastic waste ending up in Asian countries?

""We don't like to keep our waste around,"" said Hird, ""so we move it between regions. We transport waste to the United States, to South Korea, to obviously, Malaysia, the Philippines and elsewhere.""

And while companies in those countries may be willing to buy it, governments in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam started to crack down late last year — imposing bans and stricter regulations.

Malaysia's environment minister opened a container of contaminated Canadian plastic scrap at Port Klang. The country says it will send the unwanted waste back. (Eric Szeto/CBC)

Companies buy recyclable waste, because they can make money on it. This is where market value comes in. But recycling, said Hird, is not a stable industry.

""Something that we put in the recycling bin in January … that may get recycled if there's value in it, if there's a market in it."" But if there's no market, she said, then by November or December, that same material might be put in landfill because there's no longer a significant profit to be made.

What's more, said Martin Vogt, president of Ontario-based company EFS-plastics, overseas companies do not always recycle all of what we send. ""They're picking out the good plastics, and that plastic will be recycled. But most of it ends up in the oceans, in landfills … and sometimes it's burned.""

How much does Canada recycle itself?

Much less than you might think.

""Canada recycles only nine per cent of the plastic that we use here in this country,"" according to Keith Brooks of Environment Defence.

And Hird cautions that Canadians are not made aware of the costs of recycling. ""Recycling means changing that material, which often involves significant transportation.""

She uses an example of polystyrene — a standard, versatile foam plastic used to make everything from food containers to protective packaging — that is collected in Kingston.

""[It] gets shipped to northern Ontario using trucks that use non-renewable fossil fuels. It's then liquefied and made smaller, more compact, and then it's put on more trucks which are then taken to Montreal, which then are put on ships that go to the United States and go to South Korea. All of this for one more use for that polystyrene.""

So is recycling in Canada working?

According to Brooks, not really.

""We need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use. That means banning some plastic [by] the government. We need to hold producers responsible for this plastic ultimately — that's a really important thing. And we need government to take action to do that.

In British Columbia, legislation shifted the onus of handling recycling onto the businesses that create the waste, something known as ""extended producer responsibility."" Recycle B.C, a non-profit, took responsibility for the province's waste recycling about five years ago.

Is there a solution?

Vogt agrees the solution requires government involvement, but had a different take than Brooks.

He said governments need to, ""come out and say we need to have recycled content in our products in order to create the circle economy and basically get the industry going.""

But Brooks and Hird both say the real solution lies in reducing all waste, not relying on recycling."

It's better to have different points of view.",-1.0,164.0,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."

The recipes are among dozens that have been developed by 26 people, including food-service managers, chefs and dietitians who were offered two-year fellowships at hospitals from British Columbia to Newfoundland and Labrador as part of a campaign called Nourish Health.

Its goal is to help create institutional policies through nourishing meals made from locally bought ingredients for patients who may have been accustomed to powdered mashed potatoes as a mainstay of ""hospital food.""

Nourish Health spokeswoman Hayley Lapalme said the initiative, predominately funded by the McConnell Foundation, also aims to elevate the role of food as an important part of healing, though food services are categorized with other expenditures such as laundry and parking.

Two hospitals in Haida Gwaii, B.C., on the province's west coast, have been part of the program that has allowed staff to use traditional ingredients such as wild salmon, cod and halibut in the region where half the population is Indigenous.

Shelly Crack, a dietitian for Northern Health, said much of the food served at the facilities was brought in from other provinces and countries, adding to transportation and environmental costs when fish, berries and vegetables were available locally.

""A lot of our elders like the salmon served lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, with sauces served on the side,"" said Crack, adding traditional foods have helped people connect to positive experiences from their early years, and that has promoted healing.

""It almost brings them right back to the land and memories of family and harvesting food. It's that connection to culture and family, this feeling of well-being.""

Raising patient satisfaction, lowering food waste

Health-care policy leaders, doctors and those involved in the national fellowship will be attending the Food for Health Symposium in Toronto on Wednesday and Thursday to showcase sustainable recipes that could be included on hospital menus in 2030, decades after governments across the country contracted out food services at most facilities as a cost-saving measure.

Alex Munter, CEO of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, said the Ottawa facility became the first in Canada to introduce room service 15 years ago.

He said offerings like dim sum, butter chicken and tacos drove up patients' satisfaction with food from 30 per cent to 98 per cent while lowering expenses because food was being eaten, not tossed in the garbage.

""We're about healing and nourishing and not about feeding,"" Munter said of the room-service model most common in the United States.

""Since 2015, we've been providing local and sustainable menus for patients and families,"" he said. ""If your child is here you can order off the menu as well as in the cafeteria.""

Munter said the hospital's chef, Simon Wiseman, is among the 26 ""innovators"" in the Nourish initiative and last week created a tofu dish as a potential contender in a competition at the symposium.

The focus was zero waste, and even the plate was made of wheat, Munter said.

Nutritionally adequate but falling short

Toronto chef Joshna Maharaj said she helped create a healthy menu at the Scarborough Hospital in Ontario as part of a one-year pilot project in 2011, when she cooked food on site with staff whose cooking skills had gone to waste after years of reheating trucked-in frozen meals.

However, she said the program was not continued due to unrelated policy changes.

Maharaj said food served at most hospitals may be deemed nutritiously adequate, but it falls far short of what is healthy for sick people, as she recently learned after a day surgery that required a tube to be put down her throat.

She said a slushie or a sorbet would have been ideal but she decided ice cubes and ginger ale would suffice after ""a most pitiful egg salad sandwich with dry corners"" got stuck to the roof of her mouth.

""The deep insult of it was what hit me,"" Maharaj said, adding she's decided to spend her career advocating for healthy hospital food.

""Once we deal with the food on the plate there's a much broader opportunity for institutions to support health and wellness and make wonderful financial impacts in the local economy and the agriculture economy. We have a sad, sad lack of vision about this in the country, which is why I'm attempting to scream and yell so loudly."""
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/christian-woman-pakistan-arrives-canada-asia-bibi-1.5127495,"Remember how that women from Saudi Arabia was politically instrumented by the Trudeau's government? Sane thing here. In politics, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.",-7.0,165.0,"A lawyer representing a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after she spent eight years on death row in Pakistan says she has arrived in Canada.

Pakistani officials and others involved in the case said Wednesday that Asia Bibi had left Pakistan to be reunited with her daughters in Canada, where they had been granted asylum. Her lawyer, Saif-ul Malook, said she had already arrived in Canada.

Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2009 after a quarrel with a fellow farmworker. Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction last year and she had been in protective custody since then.

Islamic extremists have rioted over the case and threatened to kill her. The same radical Islamists, many of whom have been jailed for their threats, also urged the overthrow of the government following Bibi's acquittal.

Wilson Chawdhry of the British Pakistani Christian Association told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he received a text message from a British diplomat saying ""Asia is out."" A close friend of Bibi also confirmed that she had left the country, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

A statement from the association says it received confirmation around 8 p.m. ET Tuesday that Bibi ""had safely exited Pakistan.""

""Asia Bibi bravely held on to her faith through the most brutal of incarcerations that involved her having access to sunlight for two hours per month,"" the statement says. ""Now she finally travels to Canada to be reunited with her children.""

Chowdhry said in the statement released by the association that Bibi is ""unwell"" after suffering a decade of isolation both in and out of captivity.

""She must be treated with utmost care and receive appropriate medical care now she is free,"" he said.

Officials at Pakistan's interior and foreign ministries also confirmed her departure, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would not discuss the case Wednesday.

""I have no comment,"" Trudeau said. ""Obviously, there are sensitive privacy issues and security issues on this and unfortunately I can't comment at this time.""

Global Affairs Canada said Wednesday it ""has no comment on this matter."" Trudeau said last November that Canada was then in talks with the Pakistani government about Bibi.

The friend, who last spoke to her on Tuesday, said Bibi and her husband Ashiq Masih had spent the last several weeks getting their documents in order. He said she was longing to see her daughters, with whom she talked almost daily from her secure location, protected by Pakistani security forces.

Chawdhry said he had been in regular contact with Bibi's husband throughout the ordeal as well as with several diplomats involved in international efforts to get her to safety.

The case has brought international attention to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law, which carries an automatic death penalty. The mere suspicion of blasphemy against Islam is enough to ignite mob lynchings in the country. The accusation of blasphemy has also been used to intimidate religious minorities and to settle scores.

Radical Islamists have made the punishment of blasphemy a major rallying cry, bringing tens of thousands into the streets and paralyzing major cities.

Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, has been celebrated as a martyr by hardliners since he was hanged for the killing, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Pakistan's minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated later that year after demanding justice for Bibi.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed not to be intimidated by the rioters, saying the rule of law would decide Bibi's fate. But she was denied permission to leave the country for several months until sentiments cooled.

A three-judge Supreme Court panel in January cleared Bibi's final legal hurdle when they ruled there was no compelling reason to overturn the court's earlier acquittal. The judges accused those who charged Bibi with blasphemy of committing perjury, but said they would not be tried because of the sensitivity of the case. The judges upheld the blasphemy law."
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-norman-working-with-harper-1.5128872,10 Million? Where did that number come from?,0.0,164.0,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

Stephen Gallant, the federation's executive director, said the decision was made at the organization's first board meeting this year, and was the result of the high number of rugby players being injured.

""This was not a knee-jerk reaction today. This has been an ongoing discussion for the board after last May,"" said Gallant.

The news comes a day after a student who plays for Sydney Academy was injured during a game in Cape Breton. The student is receiving medical care, said a statement from the Cape Breton Victoria Regional Centre for Education.

A year ago, a Prince Edward Island high school student died after suffering a head injury during a school rugby game.

He said the federation requested statistics, covering the past five years, about the number of injuries in different school sports, specifically the total number of injuries and concussions or possible concussions.

For concussions or possible concussions, the numbers showed:

149 in rugby.

33 in hockey.

32 in football.

26 in soccer.

""The data was quite eye-opening,"" said Gallant.

For total number of injuries, the statistics showed:

454 in rugby.

187 in hockey.

162 in football.

158 in soccer.

'A difficult decision'

""It's a significantly larger number than all the others,"" said Gallant about the rugby totals. ""It's unfortunate. It's a difficult decision for the board and sometimes those hard decisions are. This has been in the making.""

The numbers don't show how many athletes played the sports in the past five years or the number of games played.

She said the sport is welcoming to everybody.

""We do not make cuts in this sport for a reason — because it takes every body type, every type of person,"" said Avery. ""You need leaders, you need followers. Now that we are not getting to play, you have girls that are now sitting and not doing any activity.""

On Thursday afternoon, a petition titled ""Bring Rugby back to NS schools"" began to circulate, and had gathered more than 10,000 signatures by Thursday evening.

Her dad, Larry Peyton, said his daughter is passionate about rugby and gets up at 4:15 a.m. to train.

""That's the commitment and dedication level that I've never seen her have with anything else,"" he said. ""This is a sport where I don't ever have to look at her and say, 'You need to practice.'""

He said he hopes the federation will listen to coaches, players and parents and reverse the decision.

'We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap'

""You can have a chance for injury if you ride to school on a school bus, buses get into accidents,"" said Larry Peyton. ""We don't want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap and put a fragile sticker on them. ""

Tony Lindley, rugby coach at Eastern Shore High School, has been involved in the sport for 32 years as a player, referee and coach.

""I feel very sorry for the kids. The kids are just devastated by what I've heard from our athletic director at the school,"" he said.

""We just can't believe the decision. I'm just speechless actually.""

Rugby Nova Scotia president Geno Carew said the organization has received ""pretty much non-stop"" texts, calls and emails since the news broke. Many members are coaches and former high school players.

""They want to know what they can do to get the decision reversed,"" he said.

He said that in recent years, there's been an international push to recognize potential concussions in rugby and ensure players are safe. The sport has grown, particularly among women, locally, and he doesn't feel it's more dangerous than any other contact sport.

""It's about evaluating that risk and taking steps to mitigate wherever possible,"" he said.

Rugby Nova Scotia has requested a meeting with the school sports federation to find out more about the reasoning behind the elimination of high school teams. A permanent change could mean the organization would offer more options for younger players.

""It would force us to try to address that situation and try to tackle the junior game a little more directly through our club system,"" said Carew.

The Chinese tech executive at the centre of a high-profile international extradition case is seeking to have her case thrown out.

Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer for Chinese telecom giant Huawei, told the the B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver Wednesday that she is the subject of an abuse of process by border officials, RCMP, the FBI and the government of Canada.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.

WATCH: Huawei Canada spokesperson details problems with case

She stands accused of violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran by allegedly misrepresenting Huawei’s ownership and control of Skycom, a company doing business in the Middle Eastern country.

Speaking outside the court, Huawei Canada’s vice-president of media affairs Benjamin Howes said the application to toss the case was based on three key arguments.

Howes said Meng had not actually broken sanctions against Iran, as alleged by U.S. authorities, and had been clear and above board about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom.

He further argued that Meng had been the subject of “serious and repeated violations” of her charter rights at the direction of the FBI and at the hands of Canadian authorities.

“The RCMP intentionally delayed the presentation of the arrest warrant in order to carry out the unlawful detention and search against Ms. Meng,” Howes said.

“This was done under the pretense of a routine border check.”

Meng’s legal team will further argue the sanctions on financial services she is accused of violating are not imposed in Canada, meaning the case does not meet the “double criminality” requirement of Canada’s extradition agreement with the U.S., and is therefore not lawful, Howes said.

In court, Meng’s lawyer Scott Fenton also argued that comments by U.S. President Donald Trump prove the case is politically motivated.

The U.S. and China have tried to keep Meng’s case separate from their trade dispute, although Trump has said he would consider intervening in the case if it would help forge a trade deal with Beijing.

Fenton called Trump’s comments “intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law.”

Wednesday’s court appearance also saw Meng granted the right to move to a home she owns in Vancouver’s posh Shaughnessy neighbourhood.

The Canadian government has refused to intervene in the case, citing the rule of law.

While Meng fights her extradition, she has also launched a lawsuit against the federal government, the Canada Border Services Agency and RCMP.

Meng claims Canada violated her constitutional rights when officers detained and questioned her for three hours at Vancouver International Airport before notifying her of her arrest.

The United States is now putting pressure on its British ally to stop the Chinese telecom from establishing a 5G network in the U.K.

Speaking in London, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo invoked the politics of Margaret Thatcher.

“”Ask yourself this: Would the Iron Lady be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption and coercion?,” he said.

“Would she allow China to control the internet of the future?”

Careful not to anger China, the British government would only say that there is no final decision on the matter.

Canada is already facing Beijing’s wrath.

Since Meng’s arrest, two Canadians — ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor — have been detained in China in apparent retaliation.

Trade issues have also become strained with China blocking imports of Canadian pork and canola.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Law professor Kenneth Jull weighs in on the decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption charges stemming from its dealings in Libya. 5:44

""These charges relate to alleged wrongdoings that took place seven to 20 years ago by certain former employees who left the company long ago,"" Bruce said.

SNC-Lavalin's price on the Toronto Stock Exchange was down by, $0.91, or just under four per cent by 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Quebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, said the provincial government was prepared to help the company financially, should the need arise. But he also said that money isn't SNC-Lavalin's biggest problem at the moment.

""The reputation issue is obviously more important for the company. And there my role is limited,"" said Fitzgibbon, who has pressed Ottawa in the past to offer the company a DPA.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

For me, a full win would mean KPMG and their clients forfeit any and all proceeds of the scheme and cover the cost of the investigation/prosecution + a deterrence fine.

Safe money's on that not being the case here.",5.0,145.0,"The Canada Revenue Agency has once again made a secret out-of-court settlement with wealthy KPMG clients caught using what the CRA itself had alleged was a ""grossly negligent"" offshore ""sham"" set up to avoid detection by tax authorities, CBC's The Fifth Estate and Radio-Canada's Enquête have learned.

This, despite the Liberal government's vow to crack down on high-net-worth taxpayers who used the now-infamous Isle of Man scheme. The scheme orchestrated by accounting giant KPMG enabled clients to dodge tens of millions of dollars in taxes in Canada by making it look as if multimillionaires had given away their fortunes to anonymous overseas shell companies and get their investment income back as tax-free gifts.

KPMG is a global network of accounting and auditing firms headquartered out of the Netherlands and is one of the top firms in Canada.

""Tax cheats can no longer hide,"" National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier promised in 2017.

Now, Tax Court documents obtained by CBC News/Radio-Canada show two members of the Cooper family in Victoria, as well as the estate of the late patriarch Peter Cooper, reached an out-of-court settlement on May 24 over their involvement in the scheme.

Details of the settlement and even minutes of the meetings discussing it are under wraps. A CBC News/Radio-Canada reporter who showed up to one such meeting this spring left after realizing it was closed to the public.

Journalists discovered references to the final settlement agreement in Tax Court documents only by chance.

CRA cites privacy in keeping settlement details secret

The Canada Revenue Agency says strict privacy provisions of Canadian tax law make it difficult to disclose minutes describing individual taxpayer information.

The Isle of Man tax dodge had been active as far back as 1999 and, according to documents filed in Tax Court by the CRA in 2015, had ""intended to deceive"" federal regulators.

Still, significant details of the scheme remain a mystery, including the role played by the KPMG's senior executives. With no public trial, those details may continue to remain secret.

Toby Sanger, executive director of the advocacy group Canadians for Tax Fairness, says the CRA should never have agreed to settle the case.

""I think it's outrageous,"" he said. ""We've had a lot of tough talk and promises from this minister about how they will crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy and corporations, but unfortunately, we've seen no evidence of this so far.""

Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier said in an email statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête that while she cannot comment on specific cases, she finds the lack of transparency about settlements brokered by her agency ""problematic.""

""I have instructed the CRA to review its processes to allow for more transparency with respect to the reasons for which a settlement is reached,"" she said.

KPMG took 15% cut of taxes dodged

One member of the Cooper family, Marshall Cooper, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s and that it was KPMG that came up with the offshore tax plan.

Documents show KPMG planned to take a 15 per cent cut of the taxes dodged, including $300,000 from the Cooper family. Internal records show the scheme was marketed across the country, with successful KPMG sales agents and accountants referred to as product ""champions.""

Marshall Cooper, pictured, previously told The Fifth Estate that he was unaware of Canadian tax laws when he emigrated from South Africa in the mid-1990s. (Facebook)

In all, more than 20 wealthy families participated in the offshore scheme.

Two years ago, Lebouthillier issued a news release outlining her intention to clamp down on the KPMG scheme, publicly stating that those involved could even face criminal charges over possible ""tax fraud.""

""The case of KPMG is before the courts right now, and we continue to pursue action against KPMG,"" Lebouthillier said in 2017 in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""We will see this to the end as Canadians have asked us to do.""

She said at the time that her government took the matter ""very seriously.""

""Those who choose to participate in these schemes must face the consequences of their actions,"" she said in a separate statement.

Yet more than two years after that pledge, participants in the KPMG scheme, namely, members of the Cooper family, were offered a secret out-of-court settlement.

In her statement to The Fifth Estate/Enquête this week, Lebouthillier said the decision to settle was not hers to make and that she had instructed the CRA to review its settlements to ""allow for more transparency.""

Minister says 'systemic changes' are coming

To ""ensure integrity of our tax system,"" Lebouthillier said, out-of-court settlements are made by the CRA and the Department of Justice ""at arm's length"" from the minister and the minister's office.

""Canadians deserve a fair and equitable tax system, and we will continue to make systemic changes within the CRA to make sure that this is the case,"" she said in her statement this week.

CBC News/Radio-Canada first revealed four years ago that KPMG, one of the largest accounting firms in Canada, with tens of millions in federal contracts, had for years been running a massive offshore tax dodge for wealthy clients it had kept hidden from federal investigators.

The Trudeau government's previous tough talk on the so-called sham had come after a document leaked to The Fifth Estate/Enquête showed the CRA itself had offered a secret ""no penalties"" amnesty in May 2015 to many of the KPMG clients involved in the scheme.

The CRA offered to have them simply pay the back taxes owed — but with the condition they not tell the public about the offer.

Liberal MPs halted a parliamentary finance committee investigation in 2016 after KPMG argued the investigation could prejudice court cases. Now, it looks like those court cases might never happen. (CBC)

Stung by those revelations, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in 2017 that the government had learned a lesson from the KPMG affair and promised to do a ""better job of getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.""

Since then, the Liberal government vowed to make sure those kinds of offshore tax dodges were in the past.

In fact, it was concerns over future KPMG court cases that prompted the Liberal-dominated House of Commons finance committee to shut down its own investigation into the embattled accounting firm back in 2016.

Documents had already begun to emerge detailing the extent to which KPMG was helping clients not only dodge taxes but also hide money from potential creditors, including circumventing the Canadian Divorce Act by ""protecting"" assets from ex-spouses.

Lawyers for KPMG had argued that the ongoing finance committee investigation could prejudice cases before the court.

Several KPMG executives had been named to testify in the spring of 2016, but Liberal MPs voted to shut down the inquiry, arguing that any more testimony and documents should be produced in court and not in Parliament.

Now, it appears that those future court cases cited as a reason for shutting down the investigation might never materialize.

The Fifth Estate and Enquête also later revealed that in June 2016, around the same time the Liberal MPs shut down their investigation, a former senior KPMG executive was appointed to the Liberal Party's national board of directors.

""There is no reason why the finance committee shouldn't restart their hearings,"" Canadians for Tax Fairness's Sanger said.

Settlements offer 'substantial savings to the public'

Sanger said it all seems like a Liberal ""coverup"" to close down the KPMG investigation.

Canadians still do not know who were the key people at KPMG involved in running the investigation, for example, how high up it went within the organization, or all the names of the wealthy clients who participated.

Max Weder, the lawyer for the Cooper family, said he ""can't comment on the settlement.""

Documents show the family paid virtually no tax over a span of eight years — and even obtained federal and provincial tax credits — despite receiving nearly $6 million from an offshore company worth $26 million that KPMG helped set up.

KPMG has always maintained the scheme was legal. The firm's lawyers claimed any money the Coopers received were gifts and therefore non-taxable. Nevertheless, KPMG now says it would not set up this type of offshore structure anymore.

For its part, the CRA said that the settlement was made in accordance with the law and is ""supported by the facts of this particular case."" The agency also said it ""maximized revenue"" by making a decision to settle out of court, instead of facing an uncertain ruling in Tax Court.

""There is generally substantial savings to the public and a benefit to the justice system when cases are resolved through a settlement,"" a CRA spokesperson said in a statement.

Presumably based on Canadian statutes that treat any sexual images of characters that appear to be under 18 as actual child pornography, the images they discovered were deemed child porn and the man was charged accordingly.

So we don't know how his case would have gone in court but they can still legally arrest you for such content as the above wording is concerned. Once again proving how backwards we are when it comes to actual child predators and fiction.

For the case about the doll it's very odd that the judge would deem it child pornography while still allowing the guy to go free making it seem like the judge was confused right to the end. It also sets a bad situation and future cases will use this verdict as basis. If you ignore all the legal mumbo jumbo we basically just gave anything that looks like a child(toys, dolls, drawings, cardboard cutouts etc.) Rights.

We need to focus on actual child predators and giving them correct sentences regardless of position(ala the officer who was found with actual child pornography but was let off easy because he was a cop) and keeping them from repeat offenses.

Foam doesn't need any protection.",28.0,84.0,"A St. John's man accused of possessing child pornography in an unusual case involving what's been described as a child sex doll has been found not guilty.

The provincial court trial of Kenneth Harrisson, 54, is believed to have been the first in Canada dealing with child pornography charges involving a sex doll.

In his decision Thursday morning, Judge Mark Pike said he believed the doll linked to Harrisson is child pornography, but the Crown hadn't proven Harrisson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Outside the courthouse after the judge's decision was given, Harrisson said he had no comment. Defence lawyer Bob Buckingham spoke on his behalf.

""Mr. Harrisson wishes to say that he is relieved that this matter is over with and his advice to people is to be careful as to what you order online from now on,"" he said.

Lawyer Bob Buckingham, right, represented Harrisson at the trial in St. John's. (Mark Quinn/ CBC)

Harrisson testified in court that he had ordered an adult doll, not the one that arrived in Canada from Japan in January 2013.

Buckingham also questioned the notion that the sex doll that was seized is child pornography.

""The piece of foam that is before the court, in my opinion and it's only my opinion, is not child pornography. The judge has made a decision otherwise and that stands,"" he said.

Buckingham also spoke about the impact the six years since his arrest have had on Harrisson.

""It has been draining. It has affected possibly job prospects. The strain was seen when he was giving evidence in his own defence.""

Early this year, while Harrisson was testifying, he collapsed and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

While speaking with reporters Buckingham was confronted by child protection advocate Linda Baudoin, who asked the lawyer if he was a ""pedophile sympathizer.""

""Are you an asshole?"" Buckingham responded. ""That's an insult to me as a member of the bar.""

Baudoin, who came to St. John's from Ontario to hear the judge's decision, said she was disappointed.

""The priority should be protecting children. He ordered it [the doll] and the proof is all there recorded, but because of the reasonable doubt factor, he gets a not guilty verdict,"" she said.

Doll intercepted at border

Harrisson ordered the doll from Japan in 2013 and it was intercepted at the border.

He testified he did not intend to have sex with the doll and he had ordered it for companionship to replace his son, who died as an infant.

Harrisson said he did a Google search of the term ""sex doll"" and he chose the photo that showed the most ""male-like"" face to resemble his son who died in 1986 but would have been around 25 in 2013.

Pike called Harrisson's explanation ""incredible,"" but said the Crown hadn't proved Harrisson intended to buy a doll resembling a child.

The judge also found Harrisson not guilty of additional charges, including mailing obscene matter, and two charges under the federal Customs Act of smuggling and possession of prohibited goods.

Well, you get the idea, you can pull up these scandals and boondoggles all day if you want.",1.0,37.0,"Eight months after he bolted from the Conservative Party and with the clock ticking to the October general election, the buzz that attended Maxime Bernier’s stormy departure from Andrew Scheer’s caucus to create a rival conservative party has dissipated.

Bernier has so far failed to parlay the significant political capital he had accumulated as a CPC leadership front-runner into a lasting electoral down payment for his People’s Party. If anything, he has depleted that capital.

Two years ago, one in two Conservative members supported Bernier’s bid to succeed Stephen Harper. For 12 of the 13 ballots it took to declare a winner, the leadership was his to lose.

Even after his defeat, the Beauce MP remained a force to be reckoned with within the conservative movement. Bernier enjoyed a profile higher than that of his rookie leader. He was also a more powerful fundraising magnet.

At the time of the Scheer-Bernier breakup, the party had cause to fear that another crippling schism of the kind that pit conservatives against conservatives at the federal level for more than a decade in the late-1980s and 1990s was once again in the making

So far, those fears have proven to be unfounded.

Liberals, Trudeau hit new low but poll suggests surging Tory support is soft

Maxime Bernier fails to gain momentum in Conservative territory

Opinion | Emma Teitel: Why is Maxime Bernier so obsessed with tampons?

Since Bernier set out on his own last summer, Scheer’s Conservatives have vaulted to first place in voting intentions. Over the first quarter of this year, they raised more money than the ruling Liberals. Over the same period, Scheer’s personal ratings have improved while Bernier’s star has faded.

This week, Nanos reported that only one in six Canadians believes Bernier has the qualities required of a leader — a rating that puts him at the bottom of leaders’ pile, below his Green Party and Bloc Québécois rivals.

As for the People’s Party, it barely registers in the national polls, with its score in voting intentions currently hovering between 1% and 3%.

Increasingly, Bernier comes across as a politician clutching at policy straws.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Earlier this month, he (or whoever uses his name on the social media) spent the better part of a week ranting against the Liberal suggestion that federally regulated employers provide free feminine hygiene products to their employees.

Whatever one may think about the government proposal, a battle against free tampons hardly qualifies as a hill to die — or even fight — on.

On Tuesday, against the backdrop of Alabama’s virtual ban on abortion, Bernier restated his willingness to entertain a debate on whether to restrict abortion rights in this country.

On the same occasion, he presented the team of candidates who will run under his banner in the Quebec City area this fall. The roster is made up of nine men and one woman, a less than ideal backdrop for a foray into the abortion minefield.

Leading the lineup was Ken Pereira, a former union leader who rose to fame in the province as a star witness at the Charbonneau commission on collusion and corruption in the construction industry.

Pereira is also a conspiracy theorist who generously spreads his theories on social media. Among other Twitter gems, Bernier’s candidate for the riding of Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier has equated climate change activism with Islamist State terrorism, and questioned whether the Pope is a traitor or mentally ill. He has also described the attacks of 9/11 as a false flag operation designed to justify new wars.

The template for Bernier’s competing conservative bid was Preston Manning’s Reform Party. It too started off with out-of-right-field policies (the abolition of the federal policy of official bilingualism comes to mind), a staunch social conservative agenda and a number of recruits who held hair-raising views on a variety of topics.

It took six years from Reform’s founding for the party to become a force in the House of Commons. Bernier used to argue he could compress those years into mere months thanks to the advent of the social media.

But Manning had a solid regional base in Western Canada to build from. Bernier, by comparison, is anything but a prophet in his home province.

Premier François Legault’s CAQ government will have nothing to do with him. Alberta’s Jason Kenney and Ontario’s Doug Ford are similarly disinclined to give the People’s Party and its leader the time of day. Ditto in the case of most power brokers in the larger conservative community.

The Reform Party came into being at a time when many conservative voters — especially in Western Canada — felt betrayed by those of their own who sat in Brian Mulroney’s government.

In contrast, for most conservative sympathizers — and many of those of who supported Bernier for the CPC leadership two years ago — job one this year is to oust Justin Trudeau’s Liberals from office.

Less than six months from the October election, conservative fears that Bernier would split the vote to the Liberals’ advantage have largely given way in many quarters of the Canadian right to relief that he did not succeed in becoming the CPC leader.

Carrying signs, the demonstrators walked from city hall down Main Street to Portage Avenue, and then up Memorial Boulevard, before ending at the Manitoba Legislative Building.

SNC-Lavalin spent months lobbying the federal government to avoid finding itself in this position. It hoped to use a new legal mechanism — a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — to pay a fine rather than risk conviction.

Those efforts continued even after the head of the federal prosecution service told the company in the fall that no deal was forthcoming.

That helped ignite a major political scandal in Ottawa when the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the Prime Minister's Office of pressuring her to arrange a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Wednesday's court decision, handed down in Montreal, followed an extended preliminary inquiry into accusations that federal prosecutors filed in 2015.

They allege SNC-Lavalin paid around $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, a violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, federal prosecutor Richard Roy said: 'The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.' (Jonathan Montpeti/CBC)

Federal prosecutors also allege SNC-Lavalin defrauded a number of Libyan institutions out of $130 million over the same period.

The contents of Wednesday's ruling, as well as evidence that was heard during the preliminary inquiry, is under a publication ban. Justice Claude Leblond had the option of dismissing the charges if he found there was no chance of a conviction.

In a brief comment at the provincial courthouse in Montreal, prosecutor Richard Roy said he was satisfied with the outcome.

Asked whether a DPA was still possible, Roy said simply: ""The director of public prosecutions has made a decision in that regard.""

Ongoing legal troubles

The company's activities in Libya have been under the scrutiny of law enforcement officials since the final days of Moammar Gadhafi's dictatorship.

A former SNC-Lavalin executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, pleaded guilty in Switzerland in 2014 to paying millions of dollars worth bribes to one of Gadhafi's sons.

Stephane Roy, a financial controller at SNC-Lavalin, was also charged with bribing Libyan officals. That case was dismissed when a judge ruled last year that prosecutors were taking too long to move the proceedings forward.

Another former executive, Sami Bebawi, is scheduled to stand trial in October on accusations he too bribed Libyan officials.

No date has yet been set for SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial. The corporation returns to court June 7, when it will indicate whether it wants a trial by judge or jury.

Reputation, not money

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on receiving federal government contracts. Chief executive Neil Bruce has said that outcome would devastate the company, which has struggled since it was enveloped by a series of corruption scandals in 2012.

The corporation lost around $2.2 billion in market value after federal prosecutors announced last fall they would not be offering a DPA.

In a statement issued Wednesday, Bruce sought to distance the company's current management team from what happened in Libya while Gadhafi was in power.

Liberals maintain support for SNC

The new federal justice minister, David Lametti, has so far refused to comment on whether the government is still considering offering SNC-Lavalin a DPA. Legally, he can do so up until there is a verdict in the criminal case.

Lametti, on Wednesday, maintained his silence on the issue. He said he wanted to ensure his statements did not influence the court proceedings.

But the federal infrastructure minister, François-Philippe Champagne, reiterated the Liberal government's concerns about the damage a criminal trial could cause SNC-Lavalin.

There are few engineering companies in Canada, he said, who have SNC-Lavalin's experience with major infrastructure projects.

""We need to make sure that we have companies like that who can deliver on the projects that we have in Canada,"" said Champagne, who represents the central Quebec riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain.

The current legal uncertainty around SNC-Lavalin extends beyond the pending trial on corruption in Libya.

The RCMP has an open investigation into whether senior company officials were aware of illegal payments made to the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, Michel Fournier.

He pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped the corporation secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge."

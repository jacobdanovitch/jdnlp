While I typically agree its fucked, the service seems genuinely helpful and the vast majority of complaints I see about it here have no factual basic. For what it's worth, while I did discover the service through Youtubers, I didn't use a sponsor link.   Also, even if someone isn't deeply depressed, having a therapist can be pretty helpful to just deal with different issues or provide some direction if it's needed. Obviously a person that doesn't need it if they don't feel a need for therapy or counseling. However, making it more available and advertising that service to people that aren't getting help but want it are fairly good things.","label":0}

Before modern civilization (for argument's sake, let's say that modern civilization starts with the WW1 era) this may have been true, but these days there are very few things a man can do that a women can't, that actually matter.  People like to make the argument there have only been a handful of women in the WNBA that have ever dunked, while nearly every male in the NBA has at least once in their career. Who cares? It's a sport. Put a man and a women through the same college courses for the same career, and I would bet money that they perform very similarly, if not identically, assuming they had the same inherent aptitude for the course.  But that has nothing to do with male vs female. You could find a woman who looks like a retard compared to Bill Gates and find a man who looks even more retarded compared to him.

They know it isn't real.  Escalation is an established part of sexual crimes.  Neither science nor law is able to currently draw a line between \"healthy outlet\" and \"practice for the real thing\" and sex robots only blur this line further.   And there is already rape fantasy porn so who cares if it's not real?  Rape porn is illegal.  Yes, there are plenty of videos on the Internet but none of those are US Title 18 compliant so technically illegal. Sex robots, presumably, would be a the first legal \"outlet\" for rape fetishists.   And I doubt they would make child sex robots so that point is irrelevant  Something isn't irrelevant just because you proclaim it so.  Why wouldn't they make rapeable child sex robots? Or toddlers? Or infants?  They are just \"inanimate objects\" to you.  Why do you think sex robots will be limited to only the fetishes that you personally support like rape?   I feel that a potential rapist could get his fix on a robot instead of a real person so that could lead to less rape, not more  Again, escalation is how every pathological sexual behavior plays out.  Your ignorant opinions mean jack shit.   And news flash most rapists rape because they can't get any, a problem sex robots will solve. so yea you are still the retarded fuck here.  Or they make it worse by letting them practice for the real thing.  It's clear you aren't capable of understanding basic reasoning so I'm done trying to explain things to a shit-for-brains incel.

He also drove a red car and wore purple gloves in the 30\u2019s too, and he doesn\u2019t do those anymore either.  Why do you seem to think I give a crap if Venom is portrayed as a villain or not? All I\u2019ve said is that his origin concerns Spider-Man in 616, which is the mainstream continuity and the one most commonly pulled from for pretty much every Marvel adaptation. There\u2019s also Ultimate, but Venom in the movie is not even a little bit similar to Ultimate Venom, so that clearly isn\u2019t the case, and Ultimate Venom is even more intimately connected to Peter than  Really, I don\u2019t know how far along you got into your high school English classes, but if you look back at my old posts, you won\u2019t find me saying anything about how Venom should be a villain.   And once again, I\u2019ve read Venomverse. None of those other characters are Eddie Brock. The Venom Punisher is not Eddie Brock. The Venom Rider is not Eddie Brock. Captain Venom is not Eddie Brock. Old Man Venom is not Eddie Brock.  But you know who is Eddie Brock? The main fucking character of that story, 616 Venom, who has history with Peter Parker and whose origin as Venom, the hybrid of Eddie and the symbiote, concerns events involving Peter Parker.  Really, I don\u2019t know how to make this any more clear. What other characters do with the symbiote is a non-sequitur and is completely irrelevant, because Eddie Brock is the topic of discussion, not those other characters.  Ideally, Venom\u2019s origin story WOULD involve him being a villain, since I guess we\u2019re moving on to this as the topic now, or at least hostile to Peter during their initial few encounters. Because that\u2019s how his fucking origin story plays out. That\u2019s another thing you seem to be missing, is my emphasizing of the phrase origin story, which this movie is supposed to be for the character.","label":0}

Imagine being so into yourself, that you are concerned someone of the same social standing as yourself would notice if you did wear the same outfit twice.  Imagine being so privileged you somehow manage to warp this scenario into one in which you are the person being oppressed.  This is privilege.  Living in a world where you are expected to only have to wear an outfit once is privilege.  It means you can afford new clothes everyday.  So while you sit around crying \"Woe is me, other women will notice if I wear the same outfit more then once, my p-p-p-p-poor self esteem.\" someone else in the world, maybe even the **Oppressor** is wondering how he is going to feed his kid this week.

I feel bad for any close women in your life, considering you are not only totally fine with them getting beat\u2014 you\u2019re totally fine with them getting beat *for no reason.* you\u2019ll sit there and assume that the beating that they are getting is rightfully deserved, you\u2019ll blame your own family member, dis-regard the situation and\u2014 irregardless of whether you know why they are getting beat or not. Thats fucking sad.   This woman is not a victim, but she does not deserve to get her face beat in by a cop. she deserves a jail sentence and she deserves to serve time.

I never want to be with any scum bag FEEEEEMALES, the fucking cunts.\"  Saying shit like that will get you both mocked by women and insulted and condemned by men.    Third, hating men is not only perfectly acceptable, it's practically *expected* for women to think \"Men are pigs.\" Men are dogs.\" \"All men cheat.\" I shouldn't even have to bring up the talk show segment when Sharon Osbourne, her co-hosts, and her audience were all laughing at a guy who had his penis cut off by his wife. All while Sharon rationalizes it.  I've never seen *any* public commentary where men laughed at the idea of a woman having her breasts cut off, or being violently vaginally sodomized, was considered hilarious and rationalized by men on television.   The closest I've ever heard to anything like that, was by a British infantry unit during the American Revolution reporting on a brutal small scale massacre that loyalist American militias had done to a family farm that supported the revolution.

Would you gamble all your wealth if there were a 50% chance of losing? Of course not. Those odds are terrible, but the same odds apply to marriage today. Think about that. It\u2019s not 1950 anymore. There are hardly any good women left for it to be worth the risk. Also your wife being rich does not prevent her from trading you in down the line; it makes it more likely she will in fact. Red Pill men do not make these stats and we do not create the gynocentric laws, so we are justified. Plus every man has the right not to take the risk when the odds are stacked against him. Nothing misogynistic about it. There is no obligation for a man to marry or agree it\u2019s a good idea in  By the way I\u2019m red pill married, but would go MGTOW should my wife ever leave. Everyone changes, but mostly women change for the worse. People are not bitter merely because they\u2019ve been hurt by a women; they just see that modern women are mostly bad news overall and choose not to bother based on that fact, the gynocentric laws, and the statistics.

I disagree with this video's assessment that the presentation isn't as bad as it's made out to be.  The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner [is acceptable](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Q4vdZAl) provided the rules and effects are clear, is  [politically neutral, and focused on tone](https:\/\/imgur.com\/rk9BYjJ), They see the platform owners as \"[hospitality organizers](https:\/\/imgur.com\/WVShVvU)\". I reject these premises. For one, I don't see google\/twitter\/facebook any more a \"hospitality organizer\" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.  Secondly, these providers [already see themselves as politically neutral](http:\/\/archive.is\/ExxVO) and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term [\"illegal aliens\"](http:\/\/archive.is\/Xe0AC) (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). Or the infamous \"gender pronouns\" debate. If I call a M2F transgender person \"he\", is that \"tone\" (and subject to censorship), \"political\" (and not subject to censorship), or a giant grey area subject to the whims of the censor and how they feel about me and\/or the subject on any given day?  Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said \"I hate these guys and want them off my site\". When Alex Jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. When has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised? You're still trying to polish the turd that is highly subjective standards with the shine of \"policy\" and \"procedure\".  Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to \"police tone\"? So far they have a shit track record in policing their platforms; why should I trust them in the future? Earlier the presentation poses the question \"by what right do you do this?\". They try to answer it by saying \"well we'll only focus on tone\", but the question remains: \"by what right are you the arbiter of 'tone'?\"  Fifthly, if there is a problem with \"tone\", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it? Why not empower the users with more advanced tools to filter things themselves (or for others with their consent) without removing the \"offensive\" material from the platform. Filter lists and moderated feeds could be services provided by users, for users and under the total control (including the ability to modify filter lists, opt-in\/out of them, and ultimately disable all filtering\/moderation) of the end-user. That way people can tailor their experience to suit their own sensibilities rather than having one standard thrust onto everyone.  Finally, I love the use of \"family friendly\" terms. When Germany censors things it's to [\"make online spaces safer\"](https:\/\/imgur.com\/9G9oAju), but when \"dictatorial leaders\" want to do so it's to [\"improve their methods of control\"](https:\/\/imgur.com\/VHMwhT1). And on the [page](https:\/\/imgur.com\/sejtdVp) where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.","label":1}

It's clear that antifa is controlled by the opposition -- this phenomenon just *shows up* in our streets, out of the blue via import from Europe and parts east? Riiiight. I'm sure THAT happened organically. Fuck sake.  OTOH, by arresting and prosecuting the (American, collegiate, usually white) street-level thugs of the Black Bloc, we can enact a bit of a \"broken windows\" policy against these scumbags before they succeed in spreading their message. It occurs to me that the target of an antifa attack is almost *never* the real target. The real target is the rest of the country. They're slowly teaching us: *don't fucking speak out or we'll come after you and your family* and it's not just the Tuckers of the world who get targeted. Tucker has resources and support. But when *I* get targeted, or you do, what do we do? Batten down the hatches, okay. But if their actions successfully cause us to retreat, contract, and avoid, while THEY expand, attack, and go on the offensive, they'll run the table with us. That can't be allowed to happen.","label":0}

{"text":"Many years ago an online friend of mine traveled across the country for Sex Reassignment Surgery.   I don't know what the 'rules' are these days ... but she had gone through the entire procedure prior to getting the actual operation. Not the least of which was a lot of therapy and living full time as a woman for a minimum of 12 months.  I think it was while we were waiting for her to be taken to theater that we were talking about it, and I asked if she thought the process was too involved. She told me (as best I can recall) that there were times when she felt that it was and was frustrated, but in retrospect that a lot of what was going on was designed to ensure that she was entirely sure about the choice she was making, and as well informed as humanly possible about the consequences.  After the surgery (and after she had recovered from the anesthesia which had knocked her around a bit) she was happy.  We lost touch a couple of years later, but she was still happy and I hope she still is to this day.   I think, as you note, her being happy was because she had been given realistic expectations.  Then we see people like Milo Stewart (a transtrender from youtube, if you weren't aware) who just wander off to an 'informed consent' clinic and start hormones with virtually no real preparation. And we see comments saying \"Your so brave\" and \"U r valid\" (yes ... they generally are that illiterate) and then down the track we see them start posting videos like  My Non-Binary Dysphoria  Say WHAT?  Asexuality, sex and Kink  Which starts with the sentence \"Hi! I'm an asexual and I have a lot of gay sex\". Seriously.  Am I still asexual?! What's my sexual orientation?  The gist is \"I no longer identify as asexual\". No shit sherlock.  CONFESSION: I can't orgasm  I wonder why?  After which Milo had clearly stopped using testosterone and now their voice is all over the place.  I compare the two, and I see that one was clearly well prepared for her ordeal. And the other has basically ruined their life.","label":0}

But, if both parties enjoy it, are not harming each other, and are not doing it in front of people who don't want to be seeing it, then there's nothing wrong with it.

The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That's entirely reasonable.   They see the platform owners as \"hospitality organizers\".   That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: \"People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to\". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn't* their standard of conduct.  For one, I don't see google\/twitter\/facebook any more a \"hospitality organizer\" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.  These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I'm not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your email.  Secondly, these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term \"illegal aliens\" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision).  The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven't been*. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report.  Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said \"I hate these guys and want them off my site\".   Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That's the point. You have to do both, that's why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency. If GoDaddy were to be consistent and transparent, they should have a rule that states: \"GoDaddy reserves the right to remove your domain, without notice, at any time, because the CEO doesn't like you.\"  Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to \"police tone\"?   Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming \"FAGGOT!!!!\" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them. *Some* boundary exists for tone. The point that Insights is making is that you should be policing tone *and not content*. SCOTUS does the same thing with the first amendment. It's why the government is not allowed to engage in \"viewpoint discrimination\", but is allowed to arrest you for disorderly conduct if you won't stop screaming.  Fifthly, if there is a problem with \"tone\", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it?  They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.  Is fifthly a word?...  When Germany censors things it's to \"make online spaces safer\", but when \"dictatorial leaders\" want to do so it's to \"improve their methods of control\".   One is the justification of the German government (which you see everywhere in lots of governments), and the other is just a quote from Soros.  And on the page where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.  The page is about \"active curation\". Everything in it is active curation: good, bad, or ugly.","label":1}

Lastly I do care about racism.  Except when it's against a race you don't care about, and then it's just \"obvious jokes.\" Hypocrite.   If you really believe that all men were created equal how do you square that with disproportionate murders by cops and incarceration?  [Black suspects are not more likely to be shot by police than white suspects.](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w22399)  This argument is fucking stupid, though. You could see a far greater disparity between urban and rural crime rates than in crime rates between races, does that somehow imply that the police are discriminating against city dwellers? Or does it just mean that people in cities are committing more crimes per capita than people in rural areas?  This idea that a disparity in outcomes implies prejudice is childish and stupid. Crime is complicated. A lot of things affect crime rates, and incarceration rates once arrested have a lot to do with what kind of lawyer you can or can't afford. Black people are more likely to get public defenders, and public defenders are shitty. Black people are more likely to be given harsher sentences on the basis of recidivism risk, because [black criminals are more likely to reoffend,](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdf\/1111\/1745-12123) with most of the difference coming from past criminal history.

{"text":"venom isn't supposed to be some ruthless psychopath that kills indiscriminately imo  He's not in the comics, he's an anti-hero who's got a grudge against Spiderman for screwing him over, Brock has a similar motivation and as a result they fuse and their desire for vengeance fuels them. Venom isn't supposed to be this heroic incarnation they've stuck together from spare parts. He's supposed to be self interested and only sides with Spiderman out of convenience. In this film he's basically just a hero trying to save the world for selfless reasons.  The movie should've been R as well considering the amounts of violence in the comics, Venom is supposed to literally eat people's heads. It doesn't even really matter if you don't want to be totally devoted to aligning with comic lore but they've departed so much from the subject matter that they've essentially made an entirely new thing that's hardly like Venom in the comics.  How do they play this off anyway with more Venom comics? Do they just ignore this movie and keep making the same thing or do they decide they're going to ignore 34 years of comics involving the interplay between Spiderman and Venom in favor of this Sony amalgamation? Probably the former. So when some kid goes and tries to get a Venom comic because he liked the movie he's either going to be confused or annoyed, possibly both.  Venom is a pussy because he's said to be one in the movie, he admits that he's one of the weaker symbiotes. In the comics (and the TV show for that matter) he's basically one of a few of Spiderman's arch-nemeses as a result of his past host with Spiderman, allowing him to give his host the powers of Spiderman and prevent Spiderman from detecting Venom with his spider sense. Also depending on which host you're talking about Venom is either weaker than some other Symbiotes or much stronger. Hell even Eddie Brock once fought and beat Superman in a crossover comic and still held his own when Superman and Spiderman worked together. Venom even fought on even footing with Juggernaut.   This also divorces the Venom lore from the very recent comics involving Knull which is a whole other thing altogether.  The real reason they made this shit movie is Sony needed to churn something out so they keep a hold on a bit of their Marvel licenses that they haven't let lapse.","label":0}

{"text":"\"Oppressive Circumstances\" -- Is that what you would call someone who has engaged in terrorist activities; namely killing a U.S. solider and then requests damages for being interrogated to find further terrorist ties?   The fact that Canada agreed to settle for an individual that has terrorist ties, engaged in terrorist activities, killed a U.S. solider (I'm sure their family and friends would be ecstatic that the murderer of their dad, husband, son, friends etc are being rewarded with a $10m gift).   And, of course we got leftists willing to defend the rights of an individual known to engage in terrorism to deaths door; but censorship of right wing views -- that's normal. What this sub and so many others talk shit about is not the fact that he was in a lawsuit and could have potentially got paid more; we argue why an individual known to engage in terrorism is somehow getting justification for this and getting paid on top? You wouldn\u2019t be fighting for this mans right if it was your father, your brother, or your husband (I don\u2019t know your sexuality or sex for that matter) being killed. Perhaps you wouldn\u2019t seek vengeance, but you would be livid if you saw a government paying an individual engaged in terrorist activities. If we\u2019re going to pay this guy 5m because he\u2019s reformed and he had psychological issues (which is why he took up arms). Why don\u2019t we start importing all the terrorists and start arguing that they just had some sort of mental issue and we can fix it. All we need to do is get them a great doc and a lot of money preferably $10m or higher and they\u2019ll reform. Trust me, these folks are golden. They\u2019ll be the most peaceful, welcoming, and produce citizens we\u2019ve seen yet.   His sister, known to defend 9\/11 attacks and known to aid al Qaeda (and I didn\u2019t bother researching the rest of the family) is reason enough for investigation. If your family is linked to a major terrorism group, you\u2019re going to get investigated to ensure that 1 you\u2019re not engaged in activities such as these yourself (which he was), 2 you\u2019re not supporting this behavior through funding, and 3 verify if you have any information linked to terrorism or the terrorism group.

There's a financial war between monied interests and billionaires going on in order to re-orient themselves in relationship to these ridiculous political times.   Yeah, that's a *big* one.  Trillions of money was made in the deliberate deindustrialization and trashing of Heartland America, and that's getting reverse *massively*.

Nah, just cast the best actor for the role in Idris Elba.  Human Torch in Fan4stick? Can be white dude or black guy, doesn't matter much as long as he fits.  But T'Challa or Steve Rogers? You give it to the best actor of that particular race that showed up.

Immigration is a way to keep growing, in our current system it\u2019s the only way unless we magically start having babies. The problem with immigration is that some cultures don\u2019t mix and that leads to problems which could end up being worse than Japan.

{"text":"Success from my point of view. Is an individual is born on planet earth. From infancy through their inevitable placement in the ground.   The individual exists relatively free from violent force imposed upon them. As well as a sense that at the end of ones life. Particular realistic milestones are reached. Upon which the individual can rest in peace.   Certain observable markers for men. Are proficiency within a particular field of passion. Construction, agriculture, livestock raising, manufacture of goods. Ranging from the bronze blade, up through the international space station.   Another marker, is when proficiency is achieved. The individual man desires to teach another person similar mastery. The only way to make more people is through the body of woman. Also around the time of basic proficiency. A man's sex drive is in full effect. He desires sex and commonly to make children whom he can teach throughout his life.   This is a very common desire. Society does not force the above paragraph upon the individual man.   Though some men do not consider the above a successful life. Some men enjoy solitude. Some men don't particularly desire to head a family unit. That is a best case.  Some men from multiple historical accounts. View a successful life as being capable of murdering as many people as possible. Then looting the possessions from the man or group of men they've murdered.   Therefore men who who want to master proficiency in a peaceful endeavour in regards to other men. Will lump men who define success as being solitary and introspective. With men who define success as murdering and pillaging as many as possible.    Women in general, define a successful life as one. In which they produce many new people. As well as being generally in good standing with the normal culture. Thereby ensuring someone will care for her for her entire existence here.   Women also have suspicion cast upon them. For example when a woman defines a successful life. As one in which she acquires as many status trinkets as possible. Through granting access to her vagina.   Yet the solitary woman is viewed as a witch. I think it's because women aren't naturally solitary individuals. Solitary women on average also display more antisocial behavior. I.e accusing a nine year old boy of sexually harassing her.   My two cents, on the subject. It's long winded. Life is long and wide ranging. So I try to give the benefit of the doubt where I understand to.","label":0}

{"text":"hell i think the problem now is that people forget you have to reconstruct the deconstruction.  like from what i understand deconstructions push tropes and trends to their logical conclusions to show the flaws and thus show a new take and proper criticism of a cliche.  you then have to fix those flaws and basically make the trope cool and sensical again.   i think it's one reason the MCU is a billion dollar franchise now outside of just being well crafted entertianment.  they actually embrace the weird and wonderful kitchen sink kitchen which is superhero comics that have both magic and superscience, gods and aliens extra-dimensional entities and ancient races all coexisting in a somewhat coherent framework.  if the original X-men films and the Nolan Batman trilogy made superheroes serious and grounded the MCU made them fun and fantastic :D  an example is how they reconstructed the deconstruction of colorful costumes where all movie supers had boring black leather for \"practicality\".  Captain America got his star spangled suit because after being given the serum he got hired as a mascot for the war effort complete with bright and goofy 1940's spandex.  and only after he proved himself saving a bunch of soldiers from a hydra prison right after a gig and improvising a better combat suit using props from the show did he come to be respected and therefore make star-spangled spandex look good.  and iron-Man is his classic flashy red and yellow because Tony Stark is a flashy egotist who loves fanciness as well as fuctionality and treated his combat suit as a hot rod. we saw him build the suit with ease due to his genious and thus earned our respect to trust his design choices and dude has wicked sense of style :D  and i wanna say the Guardians of the Galaxy reconstructed  the classic comic book trope of aliens being a suspiciously similar substitute to human culture by having common cultural trappings like toys and t-shirts present with an alien style.  like Star Lord had a grey Tee that had some sort of slogan written in an alien script and Yandu had various little funko type figurines on his dashboard which looked like stylized versions of alien animals.  like i spotted a Dunny fig with 3 limbs and 3 ears and a Littlest Pet Shop cat with one eye.  so since those little details shown space people can develop similar cultural trends to earth people it made the more pulpy stuff like Maori flavored Gladiator games in Thor Ragnarok all the more acceptable.  guess more SJW showrunners are too busy showing how racist and sexist everything is they forgot how to make it not that anymore but actual good and interesting XD","label":0}

{"text":"Look up the state laws on requirements to file a complaint, and compare that to the literal hundreds of videos where LEO officials tell outright lies to people inquiring about the process.   A sworn statement can be used as a legal document against you in a court of law, and most likely will. That's why there is a legal standard that elected officials felt the need to legislate regarding the complaint process against LEOs. So the LEOs don't retaliate.   I am still calling the lady in the story a cunt who deserves what she gets, BUT, anyone reading who wants to file a legitimate complaint against an LEO, should NEVER , EVER, NOPETHEFUCKOUTOFTHERE, sign a notarized and sworn document to complain against an LEO. There is no possibility that any half sane lawyer in existence would disagree with me.   The cops purposely trick people into signing legal documents, flouting the law. They literally intimidate people out of ever filing anything, with the easy threats that they can arrange for ten officer witnesses to contradict the complainant's document and use it to prosecute them, and the person leaves the station, and forgets about filing anything again, in their life.   Thus the specific legislations in all the states regarding LEO complaint processes that every state felt the dire need to enact into law to make sure people are not badgered into filing legal documents, or intimidated out of complaining.   Why else would they feel the need to waste all of that time and money constructing such legislation?   Once again, fuck the lady in the story, and yay for good and honest cops who do not try and trick people.   Here's an example. California state law.   ''Providing Personal Information.  You do not have to provide the personal information requested. If you  do not wish to provide personal information, such as your name, home address, or home telephone  number, you may remain anonymous.''   https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/sites\/all\/files\/agweb\/pdfs\/civilrights\/citizencomplaintpolicy.pdf   Notarized requirements as stated by most police departments in complain audit videos are illegal, but qualified immunity allows them to openly lie about the process at will with zero repercussions.

{"text":"The first video posted doesn't even concretely prove anything. YouTubers experience burnout due to increasing lack of ad revenue, Better Help comes around, people start it and get sponsored by it. The closing statement in Memeology's video trys to say that based on the sole fact that different people use the service, it must be a shill. Hell, Boogie even said to not use his link if you didn't want to give him money.  Nobody is conning perfectly healthy people into signing up for online therapy, like your Lexus comparison would suggest. If that's happening, it's on the person doing it. The way info gets presented in the other vids, it suggests YouTube is forcing the sponsorship on creators, and that just doesn't make sense to me. Regardless of how a sponsor comes into play, if all relevant info being told about the service is true and the option to not participate in the sponsor link is there, how are people being manipulated? Also, not sure if I missed something or am just blanking, but I'm fairly confused why people are attacking the quality of the service. The 2nd video seems to joke about how the woman isn't a doctor, but I don't recall any claims of every professional being a literal doctor. That video also ends with by saying this projects depression onto viewers, and I simply don't get that. If you're that susceptible to other's words, you'd either have to be an actual child or you really do need therapy.  Without relying too much on speculation and by just looking at the info from the vids and my own experience, it seems that, at worst, BetterHelp and YouTube are partnered. YouTube identified relevant creators to be partnered with the service to advertise it. The information presented about the service and the service itself seem perfectly fine. I saw people having issues with being denied service and that they were suggested to see a physical therapist as opposed to online therapy. I get being upset at that, but how is that bad? Instead of not getting the help you need or giving bad help, they inform the person why the service wouldn't be beneficial to them. Like, I don't see what else could be done about that.","label":0}

{"text":"If you think I'm defending the ideology you're rather wrong, there are plenty of things to be said about that. However, I think there's no reason to proclaim feminists as a whole are all misandrous cunts like the ones representing them on here so very often. If you think generalizations about women as a whole are uncommon and downvoted in oblivion, I struggle to think you frequent this sub.  These generalizations are often inherently bad, because you group innocent people in with others for the bad beliefs you have about them. Just like stereotypes can be hurtful when it comes to progress, even though they often hold quite a lot of truth. Even things like \"women are all indecisive\" can be hurtful when it comes to progress, because it doesn't open up for any dialogue, in fact it does the opposite.  Then again I might be wrong here, as I often see posts when they're fairly new and perhaps see different voting scores than you do, which skews my view and experience on this sub, as it makes me feel like we did in fact move in a direction similar to what OP mentions. I do feel like it has to do with the recently quarantined subs, which in my opinion are toxic, but perhaps that's also something we could disagree on.","label":0}
{"text":"It is interesting to see you consider us \"mentally fucked\" but you're unable to formulate a simple response without the utilization of phrasing that you expect to be offensive.   So let me address your points.  You PPD people are so terrified of women that you have to devote an entire sub to watching them get the shit beat out of them to feel like men.  The point of PDD isn't that people get beat to shit. It's about appreciating the rare circumstances where there is actual equality at play. That does include violence, which I do not condone, but also things like custody going to the father because the mother isn't capable, and the \"woman card\" doesn't work.  In the end, all we desire is an equal, fair and balanced treatment for anyone. We simply applaud those days where that happens, in this sub.   A leader would laugh and would be over it instantly.   A leader would be able to read the room, adjust accordingly and handle the situation in a way which seems the best possible way. Did he get up too quickly? Absolutely. But it was a management meeting amongst equals, so his \"figure of authority\" was irrelevant.  A true leader would handle the situation in such a way that it doesn't escalate and follows up with appropriate measures. But you missed that piece of context, didn't you?","label":1}

The word started off as being a word to legitimately describe something strange and evolved into a slur.   That would be equivalent to the word \"retard\" being used to describe the disabled community. Same thing. Started off as a descriptor, ended up a slur.  Queer seems to be less insulting\/abrasive though. Either way a lot of people hate the word, and also feel that queer is too much of a catch-all for straight people to get involved in the community when they shouldn't really be (ie. people in the BDSM community calling themselves queer despite being straight).   I know a lot of TERFs and ace-exclusionists hate the word because the word is commonly used by people who are just \"straights who want to pretend that they're not straight\" (ie. \"demisexual\", \"aromantic\", \"asexual\").

{"text":"The factual statistics also suggest that a very large percentage of Muslims are socially and theologically conservative, and would favor laws that restrict our civil liberties in the name of their religion. A survey of British Muslims found that a supermajority thought homosexuality should be criminalized.  Sure, they aren't necessarily jihadists. But if you believe in forcing society to live by Islamic norms even via the ballot box then you're an Islamist (\"Jihadists\" are Islamists who support terrorism as a means to forcing society to live by Islamic norms).  So are right-wing US Christians who believe that either homosexuality or abortion should be illegal, Christianists? They might never take part in any sort of activism to force their view on people, but there's no evidence to say that this \"supermajority\" of Muslims would do so, either (and in fact there is circumstantial evidence which shows they don't).   Tommy Robinson may stop short of literally saying \"All Muslims are jihadists\" or \"all Muslims are extremists\" but he virtually says it, with weasel words. His (and others like him) line is \"Muslim is an extremist ideology\". Which has the implication that anyone who follows it is an extremist, whereas in fact the vast majority of Muslims clearly do not follow Islam to extremist lengths.   Think \"major, center-left social-democratic political parties,\" left-leaning MSM outlets, and most academics.  I am sure you know full well that this is entirely subjective. Outlets like HuffPo and Guardian are generally considered \"left-leaning MSM\" but among right wing\/alt-right circles they are often referred to as \"far left\" or even \"extremist\".  As an example of how this also occurs on the right, Milo Yiannopolis works well - Milo is often at great pains to point out that he considers his views to be conservative-centrist, and in no way extreme. There are plenty on the left though, who considers some of the key beliefs he espouses - such as Muslims not being welcome in the West, and feminism being a dangerous ideology - as \"far right\".   Personally I think a good indicator of whether an opinion\/belief is extreme or moderate, is whether it involves imposing your will on other people.  Hence \"Abortion should be illegal\" = extreme While \"Everyone should have the choice whether or not to engage in abortion\" = moderate.   That's a big part of the reason why I consider myself a liberal\/progressive, rather than a conservative. To me, the liberal\/progressive option is more often than not the one which involves giving people a choice, while the conservative\/reactionary position is one which involves removing choice.  (Gun control being the notable exception, I suppose).","label":0}

{"text":"I wish I didn't, but I actually do understand how that event could have been an isolated incident, especially given that Kavanaugh and Judge were likely blacked out. One sexual assault is enough for me to say that someone should not sit on the SCOTUS. Beyond that, these kinds of allegations are extremely hard to prove and often don't come to light for many years, because the only evidence that could come up is testimony, so I see why incidents like these, if there were more, would easily slip through an investigation. At least one of Kavanaugh's former Yale friends has contradicted Kavanaugh's reports of how much he drank.   I also understand why Ford would not have pressed charges when she was 16 (or at any time within the statute of limitations). If you understand why any of the women in Hollywood who've come forwards with allegations against Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein did not do so earlier, for example, then I think you also understand. These things are difficult to prove (it's a he-said-she-said situation and the courts necessarily and I believe rightfully *must* have a high bar for proof; that's kind of just the nature of the crime and of our justice system), a criminal prosecution is humiliating and lengthy, and punishments even in the \"perfect\" rape case (like that Stanford swimmer) are too often pretty minimal. Imagine being 16 and trying to tell your parents about this and everything that will be said about you in court and behind your back. Imagine all the intimate details of your life that might become public at your school and what your friends\/classmates\/neighbors might think or say and believe or condemn. Ford, in her, testimony, said that was terrified to come forward but believed that she had a civic duty to do so. She only tried to come forwards after it became apparent that Kavanaugh was one of the final picks for the SCOTUS. I also understand that reasoning and how this civic duty changed the balance of her decision to speak up.  I get most of my news from NPR and the Journal and I linked some relevant articles\/pieces that answer most of your questions, but I'll answer them anyway. Hamstrung compared to [the investigation that never was](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/10\/01\/653430574\/former-fbi-agent-discusses-practices-for-background-probes-into-federal-judges). A supplemental investigation is already a deviation. The transcripts of the six interviews would have been passed off exclusively to the Senate in their report, which was not released to the public. Yes, of course that is within their power. The third accuser (and her attorney, Avenati, who is kinda trashy imo, tbh) was omitted, because the WH directed the FBI to only look into the first two allegations. We don't exactly know the WH's instructions to the FBI, but we do know that the WH gave limiting instructions or permitted Senate Republicans to do so and that the resulting investigation only included six interviews.   I did listen to the entire testimony, which is far from exceptional. Nearly 20% of American households were tuned in, not including those of us who were streaming it.

It would also help if the US had a functional DoJ.  And that is a nonpartisan statement.

{"text":"Let's bring it back to the gaming aspect for a moment. (Disclaimer, the following response is not to the guy I am responding to, but to the mindset of the writer in a specific situation.)  \"I enjoy videogames, but I'm not good at it and I don't want to be\"  Alright then. Here's a simple advice: Do. Not. Play. Multiplayer. At all. Play Singleplayer games that are narrative driven and have a good time. Proudly select the lowest difficulty. Cheat like there is no tomorrow. Make it fun for you, because singleplayer is ALL about you. Multiplayer isn't. If you do not want to shoot for greatness, if you do not want to become better at it, do not play multiplayer. Especially not with that attitude. If you \"do not want to be good\" at it, you are Dead Weight for your team. You make things worse for way more people than just little ol' yourself. You WILL get shit. Same as a guy who, for example, during a group project would do fuck all, then lose the data he was asked to get and claim that the whole thing was his idea in the first place when it comes to presenting it, you will get a nice variation of \"fuck you, fuck your face, fuck your attitude and get fucked by the horse you rode in on you fuck\". Do not expect a pat on the head, a cookie and a participation trophy for ruining the fun of other people. You do NOT matter more than them and not giving the best you got and not actively trying to get better is an insult to your team. If you want to matter, and not have to get good, singleplayer is there for you. There are loads of guides on the net (google-fu is your friend), there are trainers, cheats, instructions, videos, maps, step by step solutions, you can always find a solution. But even in singleplayer games, depending on the game, the answer will sometimes be \"Get Better\". That game then might not be for you. And there is loads of games of any skill floor and ceiling out there, all you have to do is pick one.","label":0}
{"text":"Rich people have money. Yes. There are people who don't have money. Yes. This doesn't make those who don't have money entitled to the rich peoples money because it's still their money.  The wealth gap in itself isn't a reason people deserve more money. The way it came to be kind of is (and I'm not advocating stealing, just challenging the idea rich people should be legally entitled to keep the amount of money we currently let them via tax cuts, etc.). In America right now, businesses operate without much fear for their physical safety. The CEOs take home the lion's share, and the military personnel who kept things safe often become homeless, develop PTSD, and\/or kill themselves. Just the other day Mitch McConnell acknowledged they were going to pay for their tax cuts for the rich by cutting social security benefits of ordinary citizens who have been paying in their whole lives. Arguably almost no one makes their fortune without the internet or road system, both of which were funded through an often regressive tax system. You shouldn't take a rich person's money violently, but there's no reason to assume they have a moral right to sit on it the rest of their life.","label":0}

{"text":"New immigrants tend to cluster, but their kids tend to mingle.   The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority. The percentage of marriages is actually not that impressive when you compare it to the disproportionate rise in non-whites. It would be a valid argument if the demographics stayed the same. As it stands, 1 in 10 married people being interracially married is actually a really poor number.  And despite the propaganda spread around here and Fox News, immigrants tend to commit less crime than native-born  Depends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position.  communities with higher immigration levels tend to have less crime overall.   Not necessarily, poor Jews commit way less crime than poor Blacks. We can find all sorts of exceptions. Rich Arabs and Muslims tend to amplify their backwards and regressive views, money has little to do with it. If that were the case, Saudi Arabia wouldn't be the World's Richest Hellhole.  Those pesky facts: guess diversity really is strength.   Once again, you people don't actually understand the points being raised by the Right. When immigration control is right - like it was in Canada until just recently - immigration is a net benefit. Again, *literally zero conservatives say otherwise.* Canada has one of the most restrictive immigration programs on the planet. The United States had the same. The United States, and Donald Trump, have never once claimed immigration is bad. Never once. What they say is unchecked and unvetted immigration is bad. And it is. This is the problem with Mexico. By the way, Mexico agrees with this which is why it is so restrictive with Guatemala. Donald Trump wants to make America's immigration policy more like Canada's.  Diversity *for the sake of diversity* is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how *on a genetic level* they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism.   Here's a spoiler for how this is going to go, though: once you codify these racial differences, you will be able to chart them based on higher value and lower value. You cannot say \"this is different\" without also assigning a relative value to it. Once you do that, we will be able to have a conversation about which immigrants are *better* than others.   So, go ahead.","label":1}

It's not like Facebook and twitter work with ideologically-biased sources that happen to agree with them, all while pretending to fact check things.   It's not like twitter and Facebook have been shown to selectively enforce their TOS based on what political ideologies you're attacking.   It's not like Google pushes Politifact, a site documented to be biased and misleading. It's not like Google pushes Snopes, a site documented to be biased and misleading.

Calling it a 'scam' seems pretty unsubstantiated, since the dev team is constantly expanding and improving the product.  Clearly money isn't being socked away in someone's offshore bank account.  Saying it has taken too long has more merit.  But after the unexpectedly wildly successful kickstarter, the project manager asked the backers if they should similarly wildly expand the scope of the project... and most were in favor of it.  So all that money went into a much bigger game than was originally pitched.  Finally, their methods of raising funds have also been criticized.  And for me, this is the seediest part of the game.  Offering a land claim token which will eventually allow them to choose land in the universe to gain legal (though imperfect) NPC protection for is silly.  On the other hand, the process has been very open and clear to all from the start, so anyone who does contribute funds should know what they are (and aren't) getting.

{"text":"Thanks! I appreciate your opinions, it's always helpful to know how people perceive it so that we can tweak it to give the right impression. We were planning on adding a short gameplay trailer so hopefully that will help a bit, but from your perceptions it sounds like we need to tweak the description a bit too.  The anti-SJW impression is accurate though, we definitely chose that as the theme on purpose, and it isn't really something that could be changed as a skin - it impacts almost everything in the game, from the level names to the bosses, and especially the cutscenes and voiceovers. It's a bit like saying Shadow Of Mordor could be Assassin's Creed if you just changed the theme.  We tried to avoid preachy and lean toward humor as much as possible, though I doubt SJWs will find it funny.  We were hoping to show that the problem with SJWs and their preachy walking simulators isn't that they have a theme, it's that they don't have a game. That there's a place in gaming for escapism, **and** a place for referencing the real world too **if** you do it right. Maybe we're wrong about that, but I hope not.","label":0}

{"text":"So by your logic...  Actually that's not my logic, but good job for the attempt. My logic is that when a word is defined by it's lawlessness it is inaccurate to use it when the event was lawful. Let's go through your examples:  unarmed black man was murdered because by definition, the state has a monopoly on force?  Actually, it would be that the killing was unlawful in the first place for whatever reasons that are relevant to this event (e.g. complying with understandable police direction, being a bystander, etc.) If it was a lawful killing then they are wrong.  An anti war activist cannot say that civilians were murdered because civilian casualties are not blanket prohibited by the international laws regarding warfare?  Considering killing civilians is [protected by international laws regarding warfare](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fourth_Geneva_Convention) this is a moot point.  Can we say OJ Simpson murdered his wife  You can considering the reason why legal cases are resolved through the judgement \"Not guilty\" instead of \"innocent\".  acquittal and double jeopardy laws suddenly render his slayings legal?  No. Primarily because the case could still be tried federally, and thus would not satisfy a logically consistent definition of legal that requires the possibility of an acquittal verdict being the necessary action to render an event legal that was previously illegal for going to trial.  Though ultimately you're wrong because of your inclusion of \"cannot\" without any qualifiers. I never said or suggested anything of the sort. I said you're wrong to use the wrong word and should instead use a different one.  After all, each of these events are indeed killings. So in any event where what was stated is indeed true, they would still be killings despite their inherent legality.","label":0}

Obviously people are free to make an all female war game if they want to, and if they want their game to fail, but then they shouldn't market it as a WWII shooter or whatever. That's just dishonest marketing. The idea that you can just add \"Based on a true story.\" and then make shit up annoys me to no end.

The 40h\/week standard is that way for a good reason. You need a healthy work-life balance. You will likely be busy enough just having a household and aside from that your brain and body need to rest. To deliberately push your body beyond without receiving extra payment and the choice to refuse is exploitation. But it not this way, especially not for startups in science and tech both and also academic positions, already starting at the PhD level. Hell, I too am expecting to graduate with my doctorate in a little over a month, but I for sure had 50-60h on average for a 40h a week contract. It is the norm despite seemingly scamtastic.   Two things need to happen: we need to stop glorifying destroying yourself physically and mentally for the pockets of your employer and people need to unionize more or start getting more with programs which protect worker's rights. Germany has good unions, but the same cannot be said of france, NL and the US. And especially for you americans out there: I as a european cannot believe that you can find work without having a legal contract! Making it mandatory to have a contract should be the first step in making things better. A contract is not there to limit you. It is a way to protect your rights and prevent your employer from exploiting you. You have a legal document you can at all times refer back to and nobody can debate it.   In france (and I think NL too) at the very least for overtime you are obliged to be paid extra. People I know let me know that sometimes they are send home after their 8h shift is over purely due to the fact that the employer does not want to pay them more.   Edit: Due to some comments on this: Of couse it's very reasonable to have a crunch busy period and expect to work a lot, then have periods where you are not busy at all. I am not saying we shouldn't ever have crunch periods. However, we should avoid them when we can and not encourage employers to chronically understaff because they know they can get away with long term giving people 60h work weeks on 40h contracts.","label":0}

{"text":"I've read people insisting the Asians vs Harvard case isn't about Affirmative Action. Is that true?  Not directly. Indirectly, the reason Asians suffer is because of affirmative action. Theoretically, you could ensure that only white people would suffer from affirmative action, but that would lead to such a decrease in the number of white people that people's eyebrows might start to go up. You can rest assured that the SJWs don't want their own children to have a close to zero chance of getting into top schools.   So in practice, if Harvard loses, it's the end for affirmative action - at least in its current form. I am fairly optimistic now that King Kavanaugh is on the court.   In any case, if Affirmative Action is upheld, what about reverse Affirmative Action? Could employers look negatively on applicants who might have benefited from AA?  Legally, no. In practice, they may try. This just ends up harming minorities who actually do have merit. Of course, the SJWs don't actually care about minorities, it is all about their ego. \"I am saving the blacks! Yay!\"","label":0}

{"text":"This woman is a disgusting hateful sociopath, and reading is actually a little disturbing. She completes glosses over obvious facts that anyone who paid attention to the story would be well aware of... let alone a fucking *journalist*.   Aziz Ansari is the latest in a string of men re-entering the spotlight after accusations of sexual misconduct forced them to take a breather.   You mean the self-proclaimed male feminist, who was accused falsely, and legitimately felt bad about the situation and tried his best to make things right despite the fact that again, he did nothing wrong. Who by the way, he was never forced to take a breather, he never took a breather, and the idea of him not continuing to do his thing was never brought into question by anyone... This woman is so fucked in the head. This is without question someone who is a sociopath.   Ansari\u2019s charges  He was charged with nothing, you deranged demonizing psycho cuuuuunt.   the reality is that many women are still taught  Its always interesting reading a feminist start the sentence with this, and always end it with lies. Women are taught they are always the victim, they should always be afraid, men are stupid and below them, and should worship them. I could go on. They are never taught to be the caretakers of the male ego, no evidence to support that.   We learn at an early age to value ourselves based on our ability to be agreeable, to please others, to silence our anger.   This one makes me laugh, this applies to all human beings, and its called not being a shit head. Is that really difficult to do?   To deny that this is still reinforced to young women daily is a privilege of ignorance and convenience.   Privilege of ignorance and convenience is not ever seeing men as victims.   I feel bad for what Ansari endured.   If that was true, you wouldn't be demonizing and attempting to twist words into suggesting he was actually charged with sexual assault, you sick fuck.   But if anything is clear from this post-accusation world, it\u2019s that empathy doesn\u2019t seem to come easy for these guys. Unlike most (not all) women, who apologize so often that we have professional support groups to stop us, their response is not to feel sorry for what their accusers might have been feeling; there\u2019s not an ounce of real self-reflection to be found. Instead, they are furious at being policed. For the first time, we are not care-taking their egos. And I have never seen them so mad.  This is perfect. This is so fucking perfect. At no point in time does any of this make any sense what so ever... until you flip the genders haha. Seriously.  \"it\u2019s that empathy doesn\u2019t seem to come easy for these guys. \"  Empathy doesn't come easy for this woman, she literally implied he got charged for sexual abuse over a false accusation she has still yet to mention is false. Thats called zero fucking empathy.   \"their response is not to feel sorry for what their accusers might have been feeling; there\u2019s not an ounce of real self-reflection to be found.\"  Women like this make no attempt to feel sorry for what their accusers have been feeling, and this woman has yet to provide any self-reflection so far in her article lol. This is fucking gold.  \"Instead, they are furious at being policed. For the first time, we are not care-taking their egos.\"  This is every single person who has a negative response to mens rights activism.   \" And I have never seen them so mad.\"  lmfao, she writes in an article filled with her crying, ranting and raging about men. Yea, okay hun, uhhh, kind of hard to take you seriously with that comment when you're foaming at the mouth.    If he offered even a sliver of empathy, an acknowledgment that the \u201ccreepy dudes\u201d he once referred to in his bits, are everywhere\u200a\u2014\u200aso much so that he didn\u2019t even realize he was one of them\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe it would have struck a chord.  I think if you read in between the lines its pretty obvious why this woman is raging so hard, if she offered a sliver of empathy, a guy doing nothing wrong and being *falsely* accused wouldn't have struck a chord. That and the fact that what she is saying literally makes no logical sense what so ever, Aziz was so upset he moved on and continued working? Where is she getting this information that Aziz was angry?    Instead, they cling to the same aggression and anger that got them in trouble in the first place\u200a\u2014\u200aand that bit is getting old.

{"text":"It's an open world. If you don't want to deal with slavery or whatnot, you wouldn't have to. They could hide this stuff behind gates, sort of a 'Do you really want to delve into this storyline?' choice. The black slave trying not to talk to the PC, which players could either be interested in or uninterested in. And if you can't make a good story from slavery, you're a hack writer.  Well, they are not obliged to make a story about slavery. It is not a valuable nowadays because it is too trivial. It's basically a token plot right now. The peak of art was always about surpricing and shocking(withing the limits of course) people. You could invent something new or just show something familiar in a new unusual manner. Eh, i got a little bit off track here - it's just a game afterall, but anyway. I liked Jango because it was cool as fuck and it was a time where everyone didn't constantly try to shove a portions of wokeness into my face. I myself would like some anti-wokeness in a game - it would make furor and tickle the nerves of people really badly. For example, they could show how people take a pride and come to harmony by fulfilling their respective gender roles in the best possible and selfless way, and how it was important for society at that time, and how everything would fall without this. It's sensitive topics of course. I mean no one, including me, wants to provoke people to hatred and discrimination.   social\/historical immersion  That's not immersion. Having woke storyline in a game about 1899 year is a counter-immersion. That kills immersion. Usually, it wouldn't, but today it would. It's just my personal opinion btw. I pesonally didn't even like the look of main character in last god of war game because he suspiciously reminded me something i see too often nowadays, but lots of non-left people didn't mind it at all. I mean, they could choose the different form of beard, for fuck's sake...  Well, to summ up - they could have a story about slavery if they genueinly WANTED to. Irrelevant game journalist don't have a right to DEMAND this kind of a story from developers. Moreover, the attitude that developers are obliged to make a story about slavery kills the whole point of having it in the game.   My point was about the accuracy of what this writer was saying  Tbh i didn't even read the article. I just like arguing on reddit and writing accusatory walls of text despite having difficulties with english.   So I'll admit that I'm being converted a little bit  I could start a conversation about that but i like kia to stay free of politics as much as it is possible. Let's keep clean and healthy at least one place.   If you don't want to deal with slavery or whatnot, you wouldn't have to.  Yeah, i mean i understand that, but lets not forget the all of this are demanding time.","label":0}

{"text":"Arctangent - there are things in this world that are worth getting into a fiery shitstorm about. There's also things that clearly are not. This qualifies as the latter. When you hold uncompromising views, you are creating more problems than you are solving. This was a bunch of dust that did not need to be kicked up, but you went and did it anyway - and for what? I apologize if this is a real issue for you and I do not mean to offend you, but you also have to look at the bigger picture here. The world is nuanced, and as long as you continue seeing it in black and white you become just as despicable as the very people who have originally made this such a horrible issue as it is in the first place today. Extremists are extremists - period. It doesn't matter if they're \"far right\" or \"far left\" - no matter what views they hold, the EXTREMISM is the issue, not the values they believe that they hold dear.   In the future, when you find yourself starting to do what you have quite literally become famous for doing - take a step back, breathe a little bit, and come back a little bit more calm. People aren't as evil as you try to make them out to be.   Further thoughts: Honestly I believe that both sides of the issue is nothing more than a dick stroking contest to see who is \"morally superior\" - I'll give you a little hint: no one is! Not when you act like THAT, anyway! And also - you attacked someone who is VERY much against extreme religious crap that a lot of people try to pull - and who could've been an ally and an advocate for you on this issue - but instead of trying to see from his perspective, you forced him on the defensive immediately and lost him completely on the issue. When you do that, you're not helping your cause at all - you're pushing people AWAY from it. You're being belligerent for no real reason, and in the end, it hurts your issue more than it helps it.  Well put. Arctangent kept calling everyone who disagreed with itself \"giant pieces of shit\", which is hypocritical since that told me it was the bigger piece of shit.","label":0}

One is a display issue. Someone at google failed to hide from the user in some cases that his comment was modified.  Just in the face of it I know which is more likely.

With all Star, I view it as \"This is a version of Bruce who is still mentally 8 years old who promised to spend his life warring on criminals and acting on it regardless of what others think.\" and partially what I always viewed Bruce Wayne generally as.   They rescinded it because of fainting couch PTA types, It wasn't because that's where they wanted to go, it's because their publishers had pressure put on them, same with Moulton and how he used S&M in wonder woman. Yeah, batman comics Today aren't even remotely resembling what they were 30 years ago even. Not sure why you're giving me time table on things, I know when these things were. Yeah and George lucas made the prequels, just because the creator does it doesn't mean they're above reproach for it or can't have their reasoning question. Except they didn't reboot it, if you read the issues he did kill when he was teamed up with Robin and the ones after they stated the no kill rule, the only thing he said is \"we don't kill\" now and instead of pushing someone back on to their ally's swords he tosses them aside, still the same writing style and tone.

{"text":"Just reading all the stupidity going on over there and now being able to point out how retarded they were was pissing me off  Pretty much exactly the ridiculousness we're going to face. I guarantee I disagree with most of the people in this sub about so many things, but I also disagree with everyone everywhere about a fuckload of things. I like to consider both sides of every balance, but the illogical reality is that every Yin\/Yang argument has the majority of people yelling either White or Black, meanwhile, they're ignorant to the fact that the heart of their own argument is the opposite color.   When people see women as victims constantly deserving support, they're literally falling prey to our evolved desires to support and protect women, and while that's natural and fair, it's normally tied to a lot of freedom from the male side of the equation. As it stands now, men are being demonized, financially damaged, culturally ostracized, and unconditionally hated for being weak. Men are naturally expected to be strong, but society is basically no longer allowing us to do that in many natural ways. We're still demanded to be the assertive pursuers of dating, then the hypergamous reality of women still has them dating up, all while we're being shamed for being \"incels\" like that's somehow new. It should be blatantly considered promotion of \"toxic masculinity\" to *call* people incels, yet it's what's happening culturally. And if you're strong and assertive, you better do it all perfectly in the right way and toward the right person, because otherwise you're going to be seen as a violent predator and demonized for thinking about the thing that caused every fucking one of us to exist.   It's absolute insanity. I'm looking at these internet attitudes mainly, but these hiveminds *will* dictate the future of our culture. We're being trained by shills and plenty of other seamy groups into a state of purely hateful division, and it's disgusting to see this from my perspective as a humanist. All that matters to me is the chance to share a balanced perspective between different arguments, but what's happening? Slowly, my one account, when I'm \"not allowed\" to make alts for risk of being shadowbanned, is being ostracized sub by sub based on the whims of a few people who control the conversation of millions.","label":0}

Snowflake Richard Meyer is a laughingstock, exhausting infant, & creatively vacant douche to 99% of the comic book industry. That's why his career is shit.  The projection is too fucking real. Who the hell is this guy? I've never heard of him. Also, writing comics isn't Zack's career, he has stated that multiple times.   Basically\u00a0@EthanVanSciver\u00a0is, at best, a bully.\u00a0 Dick Meyer of\u00a0@DiversityAndCmxis, at best, a bigot who has regularly harassed people online.  Ethan seems like a really nice guy. Ya boi Zack hasn't harassed anyone. I'm still waiting for actual proof, not accusations.    When a whole lot of people wouldn't do anything at all, Mark tried his best to help. Many times in ways the public never saw. Mark's got my full support. Always.  Okay, I'm done with the support tweets like this. This has nothing to do with the suit, it's just personal opinions of Waid. Moving on.   These fools feel empowered by the news of the lawsuit.\u00a0 Just wait until they get hit with the bright red cock of justice!  Lol, what? This tweet will be hilarious if Zack wins.   \\#IStandWithMarkWaid\u00a0because he\u2019s the only one with the truth on his side. I look forward to the discovery phase of a trial that his bigoted, abusive opponent will end up paying for.  The truth that he contacted a company he's not associated with to tell them lies about Richard? Still waiting for proof that Zack's a bigot.  Zoe Quinn quote. She's irrelevant, she's writing a book for the Vertigo imprint which died, was revived, and thoroughly shit on. She's not a professional in comics or gaming, just a professional victim.   Unbelievable that Dick is so delusional and egotistical he can\u2019t see that this is just going show more of his ass.  ...okay? Is this an idiom where Kwanza is from? And I the only one who read that as Richard doing his Kwanza voice?   \\#IStandWithMarkWaid\u00a0because it\u2019s not his voice keeping these clowns from careers in comics.   It\u2019s common sense, decency, and good taste.  How retarded are you? It was Mark Waid's fault. If Richard had no common sense, decency and good taste, Marvel would probably hire him.   Richard Meyer is a vile racist misogynistic snowflake and his cowardly lawsuit will expose him before the law\u00a0  Vile? Nope. Racist? Have you heard about his kids? He's definitely not racist. Misogynistic? He hates women so much, he has sex with them! \/s He even does videos with his daughter. I'm not seeing the hate. Snowflake? What, does he have preferred pronouns? No? Not a snowflake. Cowardly lawsuit? If there's any cowardice, it's from Waid's actions.   So expect you all to get requests for all communications and it's now all public. Think no one will hire you now? Wait until all of that is public. Meyers in his hubris just sunk you all. Congrats, you just played yourselves.\u00a0  What, are you going to dox everyone that supports him, and keep them from getting employed? That sounds like a threat.","label":1}

For all this talk of how put upon mods are and how horrible users are, you commit the same mistake as every other shitty moderator on this website, and that is that you hold the user base in **abject contempt**.  Don't make me laugh about \"transparency\". Transparency by way of having all the chaff visible, maybe. This mod team makes just as many shitty decisions as any other, makes the [same anti-user decisions as many others](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dsmr\/wiki\/pathologies), and has just as many judgment calls couched in fake objectivity (protip: putting numbers next to a subjective thing doesn't make it objective), and not to mention [***five goddamn pages of conduct rules!***](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KotakuInAction\/wiki\/rules)  Worse, they suffer from probably the single greatest sin of any moderator, and that's that they don't think they're doing their job unless they have their fingers in *stuff* changing *something* *somewhere*.

Apple cider is not going to taste like apple juice+ additional alcohol.\"  It wasn't too bad though. It wasn't fucking beer. I don't much care for beer. It's the taste at the back of a swig, or a sip. I think that's the hops? It makes me think of coffee and the bitter taste at the back of it no matter how much shit you do to that coffee.

Unless there is a massive current problem starring you in the face. Stop trying to \"fix\" everything. You will likely just make it worse. Stop changing things that don't need changing. You are making your existence upon this planet, your entry into the experiment that is mortal life, a net negative for everyone else- and possibly even yourself.

If the contemporary right is becoming more liberal, that doesn't mean the contemporary right is changing - it means more people are accepting of liberal values (which the right has traditionally not been). And I fully agree.   But, I honestly think you are trying to paint a picture of a new, improved, updated right-wing - accepting of gays, accepting of personal freedoms when it comes to issues such as abortion etc... which at best, is simply a thinly veneered attempt to attract \"new blood\" by throwing out some of the ideas that simply aren't going to wash in the modern world (eg - Milo being \"flamboyantly gay\" - while at the same time taking an anti-gay stance on just about every gay rights issue - such as gay marriage which, even though he has indulged in it himself, he claims should be \"called something else\".)  And at worst (in the case of the far-right) is exactly the same as the old-right has always been.  You have to admit, the so-called new, \"liberal\" right wing which you are trying to convince me exists, and the old fashioned Bible-thumping, cross-burning right-wing have an awful lot in common - Love of Trump, hatred of feminism, hatred of Islam, rejection of #metoo, belief in traditional gender roles, willingness to engage in conspiracy theories (Pizza Gate, Sandy Hook being a false flag) and, as we're discussing this on a Gamergate subreddit, hatred of Anita Sarkeesian\/Zoe Quinn.   And if we include Breitbart readers\/commenters (who certainly would include themselves, and I don't really think you can exclude them simply because they don't fit your idea of what constitutes the \"new right\"), then we can include white nationalism in the mix, too.  Breitbart, by the way, to some extent, represents the more moderate end of the \"far right\" - I could easily have cited Andrew Anglin or Richard Spencer - outright white nationalists.    You may say they are different, but they are unequivocally the same in many ways. So it's really just a PR exercise.","label":0}

There\u2019s a bridge between that exists, even tho it isn\u2019t qualitative to actual numbers. We have a president, who knows as much evidence as I know about the case, publicly decrying her. So it goes both ways in assuming she\u2019s either 100% true or 100% lying.   I\u2019m striking the balance. Part of judging is weight the facts and testimony. I\u2019m saying she was more believable based on comparing the two\u2019s testimony. There\u2019s so much evidence suppressed by the WH and they absolutely continue to handcuff the investigation.   And based on SHEER character, BK was belligerent and very wayward. His deflection tactics were embossed by his disgust at being questioned. His inability to cop to things he shouldn\u2019t be lying about (his drinking habits). The fact that even in his own calendar, he marked out a date that listed him hanging out with the very people Ford said we\u2019re witnesses to what she claims.  People have been put away for less circumstantial evidence.  And again, I think, even in conjecture alone, a testimony like what BK gave would never be believed if he were the one presiding and judging over. No lawyer would ever coach a witness like that. Let alone a judge who knows exactly what to look for. (Source: family of lawyers, many of whom lean right).  And again, I think overall we live in a society of victim blaming for many things, not just rape. To designate it a culture is a step to far. But there\u2019s a good enough segment of Americans who either say it wasn\u2019t a big deal, say it wasn\u2019t true (without even knowing) or if both are true, it\u2019s something everyone has done.

{"text":"No, AMGTOWALT. Human nature doesn't change. Part of the reason we are MGTOW is because we have realized that our nature has betrayed us. That's why you see the constant stream of guys that go \"MGTOW for life!\" then find a woman, get involved, go back to their beta nature, get screwed, and come crawling back to MGTOW with their AWALT stories. Defeating human nature is hard for both men and women. We have proclivities that lead to great genetic selection, but also to great sorrow for everyone involved. In my opinion All Men Are Like That just as much as All Women Are Like That.  The differences you're pointing out come from women that are raised in good environments or realize early on that their nature will poison their lives. These women actively go against their nature, often because of deeply held religious belief, to avoid hypergamy and a whole slew of other issues. However, they are *just like other women*. They have the same desires, fears, and urges.  This is why sometimes previously steady women go haywire. Let me give an example (I apologize for the excessive background, but without background the example makes no sense).   I'm Mormon. We have deeply held religious beliefs that are often seen as insane or unreasonable. We also have a leadership (at local levels) that is selected entirely from members of the congregation. The women's organization (Relief Society) has a president that is selected from the most faithful women in the congregation, and must meet very specific requirements. For example, she must be married and a full tithe payer (gives 10% of her income or her family's income to the church each year). This requires a certain amount of dedication. The bishop of each congregation has similarly stringent requirements.  One of the most common issues in the church is affairs between the relief society president and the bishop. These are both deeply religious people that believe in the sanctity of marriage, but the circumstances in which they work together plays towards the darker side of human nature. Women love being with a powerful man.  I've seen women that have 5 children and have been married for 15 years throw it all away for a quick fling with the bishop.

The kid's not 18 yet, according to his driving license. (Epic fail, Dad... clearly you've never heard of CPS).   The journalist... creepy as fuck, but ends up just being, well, creepy and maladjusted. And he's watching porn in public. He's not a paragon of, well, anything.  The woman who owns the store seems pretty nice. The guy who runs it is clearly batshit crazy and racist. Those people do exist, and it makes for a better story if you run into them. (Like in the first game - OMG! Drug dealers exist! That's crazy!)  We're only one episode in. I don't think it'll be racist white people all the way down.

{"text":"Oh fuck off, this is the epitome concern trolling. You're literally saying you're concerned about a supposedly common phenomenon, yet cannot link to a single fucking example. This is a perfect example of concern trolling.  And no, this is not a ''concern troll'' or a ''shill'' or whatever stupid term that some people here want to shout at everyone who they don't agree with.  Concern trolling has a clear definition, and it applies to your post and subsequent comments.  Any outright sexist comments are quickly downvoted on this sub, there's literally only one post in this comment chain that could qualify and it's highly downvoted. There doesn't seem to be any actual issue with rampant sexism.  You know what else is highly downvoted? Any post pointing this fact out or calling you a concern troll, which you are. Smells like a cheap brigade.  You know what else is interesting? All the highly upvoted posts claiming that this thread is filled with misogynistic comments. Again only one, highly downvoted. If there were others the mods deleted them. So again, what's the issue that deserves a meta post?  Tldr: your opinion is baseless at best, malicious at worst, this whole thing stinks","label":0}

{"text":"I think that if that's your experience, perhaps you're acting like a stereotypical clueless uncouth Chinese mainlander, that doesn't realize how rude he or she is being, and is pissing off their Chinese-American friends and has a bit of a inferiority-complex chip on their shoulder.     I mean, everyone knows that the Chinese have the worst stereotype for manners and selfishness if going by broad generlizations.   Which is the main problem, there are so many in China, especially older or poorer, that literally never learned even the most basic etiquette.   They are like the polar opposite of Japanese in that respect, and you can do rude things around Chinese mainlanders and they may not respond negatively, because they too don't even understand its rude... totally oblivious.   Just as a random example, had a Chinese woman just push her ass in front of me, when we're all standing in a line politely waiting our turn, didn't know anyone just literally elbows in and had to get rude back with her to get her to get in line like everyone else.   Chinese-American woman would never be so rude, as they were brought up to know acceptable social behavior.    Not to mention, Chinese will literally just spit right in front of you, sometimes even indoors or an elevator, its like WTF... Chinese-Americans would never do that.

Honestly for all his twitter shit(cause this is \"current year\" where twitter bullshit can get you fired) especially because some of it seems to be related to the case in which you aren't really suppose to antagonize people and show your extreme ideological bias of basically acting like waid's fuck buddy. Also isn't calling someone else's ethics or credentials into account when you know theyb are legit kind of unethical? Not to mention the fucking *FLAT OUT EASILY PROVABLE LYING(probably of his and certainly from waid in a written legal account)!!*  Seems like enough for Rekieta to suggest to the bar that this guy is unethical. Or do you both have to be in the same state?  Regardless of what Rackets does, I hope him trying chicanery lying bullshit before the court gets his weasel ass disbarred. The guy is CLEARLY fucking unethical as well as a shitty human being. At this point I wonder if he's just Waid's clone.  Waid\/Zaid claim Waid did not know Antarctic Press was located in Texas. Waid stated he knew the owners when he Tweeted he was calling them and called a Texas phone number.  The fuck kind of defense would that be? Like \"yeah I know I broke the law but I didn't know it was Texas so I'm okay\" at best that seems that it should mean he is tried in California but maybe that's the point that he wants soy filled judges not a proper american one.

{"text":"The game\u2019s interactions are constrained due to its inspirations. Westerns are a complex and problematic genre tied to a violent history that gave rise to the myth of the gun as an egalitarian tool (e.g., the oft-quoted \u201cGod made man, Sam Colt made them equal\u201d) and rugged, self-reliant masculinity. As a result, interactions with *Red Dead Redemption 2*\u2019s NPCs exist within that masculine framework. Arthur and the player\u2019s actions are expressions of a mythic masculinity. We rescue women and lesser men\u2014after all, better men would be able to fight off bandits and manage their horses\u2014 and compete against would-be gunslingers while using unique abilities like Dead-Eye to our advantage. We tip our hat like a proper gentleman, and we kill anyone we want. The game rewards those masculine impulses without fail.

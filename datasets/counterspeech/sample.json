PayPal is a business and can choose who to do business with, so long as they aren't making that determination based on a protected class (race, gender, etc). No business is obligated to offer services to someone with whose views they don't agree, and though I would prefer this not apply to payment providers (whose only service is moving money around), unfortunately it does.  The Unruh Civil Rights Act they cite makes no mention of political affiliation. It specifically outlaws discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, mental or physical disability, age or medical condition (including HIV status). HOWEVER (and this is what Jones is banking on) the California Supreme Court has held that the protections of the Unruh Act are not restricted to these characteristics.  That being said, extending its protection to cover what can be characterized as conspiracy theories and related nonsense is going to be a really hard sell. If Paypal was discriminating against a guy for his choice of political candidate, maybe.

If it were a woman accusing a man of sexual misconduct falsely, we all stand up and start shouting loudly that we need protection against it, yet we find this acceptable? How is accusing someone without solid proof (and potentially falsely) any better than these women that do fake rape reports. Both are destructive as fuck to the individual accused and if the individual is deemed innocent, they have to fight that for the longest time.  That was the most retarded comparison I've ever heard.  This post: A woman admitting to a crime, then getting accused of said crime.  Your example: A woman accusing a man of a crime with 0 proof and without the man in any way, shape or form admitting to anything.  That's fucked up of you to compare.","label":1}

{"text":"You know what annoys me about this. It's not the weird \"not oppressed enough\" vibe, it's that their argument doesn't actually make sense.  So they start with a number of LGBT individuals saying how they're \"just like you\". They also have a bunch of other unrelated traits that SJWs don't like, just to make sure that you know to hate them.  Then they present a bunch of supposed counter-examples to the idea that pushing \"we're just like you\" is bad, but their counter-examples are nonsensical.   A woman complaining that she accused of having kids for welfare. I assume because she's black. I was under the impression that the 'B' in LGBT stood for 'bisexual', not 'black', shows what I know!  A woman complaining about being harassed and arrested on the suspicion of being a sex worker. It's not clear why from the avatar though, but I'm guessing she's supposed to be South-East Asian? Either way, I'm not sure what the point is. Racism is bad, but what does that have to do with LGBT people?  Homeless woman(?) complains that their sexuality bars them from shelters. Giving them the benefit of the doubt that this is a real problem, it is actually relevant. What I'm failing to see is how that demonstrates a problem with \"just like you\" messaging. Surely if the people running these shelters understood that being gay wasn't really a big deal, they'd let this person in. Also this homeless woman has autism, that isn't actually relevant, but they pretend it is.  Immigrant from ???, at least that's what I assume. Ignoring the weird \"gender variant culture\" stuff, I'm not really sure what the issue is here, again. Colonialism was bad. Racism against immigrants is also bad. How is this an LGBT issue?  Victim of the War on Drugs. I'm guessing orphaned after the Houston Heroin Bombings of  Seriously though, the war of drugs is bad and has had a lot of collateral damage. Again, how is this an LGBT issue?  Wheelchair user complaining about the world being inaccessible to them. Fair enough, I guess. I'm not physically disabled, so I don't know how bad it is for them, but it doesn't matter because it's *not an LGBT issue*.  So 6 examples and only one is clearly relevant (and even then includes some irrelevant stuff). None actually demonstrate the problem with \"we're just like you\" messaging though. Racism is bad, sexism is bad, ableism is bad, but none of those are problems that are relevant for the LGBT community.","label":0}

This sounds suspiciously like they simply didn't know the first thing about making an online game and really did just mod an online mode into the existing game with *zero forethought*.   *Let it break in Beta so it'll be fixed at release* is fine when it's small things and holes in your security. This is beyond that *if true* to the point where there basically *is no security at all*.   I'm actually struggling to believe this *is* true, because it'd be an act of incompetence so staggering that even a cold hearted cynic like me is struggling to believe they could be that bad.","label":0}

I wanna come to your house and stand in your face with my fists squared.  And if you try to swing at me first, you're a raging asshole, k?","label":0}

{"text":"The guy said he thought it was just a friend joking around. If he had resisted, it would have been much more difficult. I kind of feel she still would have been successful though I wouldn't bet my life savings on it. It was the element of surprise she had is probably the main factor. I'm not saying she's an all dominating bastion of strength, just that it was brave of her to confront what she thought was her attacker, and impressive how competent she was at doing it.  He would have been justified in defending himself for sure, and yeah you get white knights like that sometimes, but it's certainly not a given. A lot of people are more intelligent and do just try to separate and don't assume the male is the aggressor.","label":0}

{"text":"This was posted not so long ago. Im sure I  remember people being worried for her welfare as the video showed the man was being very controlling. It's possible she was being encouraged to do these things for followers and views online and the guys were probs making a shit ton of money off her. It seems odd she would agree to do this knowing she would fail.","label":0}

{"text":"He really seemed better at the time than what he turned out to be. Sort of like Obama.    He did have 10 years of training at the hands of the finest Liberals, he seemed to be really competent in the debates and legalizing weed was something the country had been screaming for since the days of Chretien.    We were fooled of course, but don't let the polling numbers convince you that the country isn't outraged by his behaviour as Scheer and Singh are a bad joke at best.    As for Red Green, that great Canadian seems to be spending his retirement uploading clips to youtube with his commentary so I have no complaints there.    As for the CBC, if we burn their building down they'll just build another one with our tax dollars, 100 times as expensive as the current building.    We're smart in our own way. Don't get fooled by the current state of our politics. Just remember my (what-I'm-assuming is) my American friend, Trudeau is our Obama and Obama won a second term solely because he was running against a McCain-Palin ticket. Your last election could have easily been Hillary vs. Jeb if things had worked out the way that your foreign influences would have wanted. We'll figure this out.    Our next great leader has already broken free and has started his own political party that will return our country to greatness. We just run 7 years behind you.","label":0}

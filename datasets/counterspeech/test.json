{"text":"In Italy, up until a few years ago, daytime television was heavily censored. For example, jokes that would put Christianity in a bad light used to be removed.   Since the early 90s we have something called \"the green zone\", a programming block suitable for all ages. That is: tits and asses are a-ok, as long as it's in soap opera or talk show form. But anything else is no-no-no.   An \"independent\" group called MOIGE (MOvimento Italiano GEnitori - Italian Parents Movement) used to dictate what was allowed on television, maybe they still do. Of course, this is Italy, everybody knew it was a front for the Catholic Church. The Simpsons episode \"Funeral For a Fiend\" (Season 19, Episode 8) was censored: when Kent Brockman lists a number of \"outlaws loved after their deaths\", Jesus is cut from the Mediaset broadcast. Sky broadcasts, however, are uncut.   They went as far as censoring the nipples and armpits of a male wrestler with an old TV set as his head because it promoted homosexuality, clearly. It appeared for less than 2 seconds... on a network ad promoting the green zone. That was in early 2000s on La  An insignificant change my ass.

When you don't have an argument I'm forced to respond with a low-hanging fruit such as sarcasm.   you're arguing for reducing people's right because they didn't \"earn\" them.  No. I'm just saying that people should never had such right before they earn tham. That includes me too, you know. Currently it's pointless to argue about this since it cannot be reversed, that's why I'm not arguing about that, I'm just \"saying\" it should have never been like that.

Rights are granted by god... that's in the constitution.  Not a religious man so I can't say. Tho legal rights and equal rights are not God Given... whatever.

I am at place in time where the ignominious behavior displayed by both groups become one in the same. If I wasn\u2019t on mobile at the moment I\u2019d look this up, but there is this political theory (and I apologize if it is clich\u00e9 or archaic to even mention it) that uses a horseshoe for its presentation. The far left and the far right divert not just away from the center, but closer to each other ultimately.   I know many people know about this theory, I know it\u2019s not an original or creative talking point, but it is something I wish was more explored.   Obviously both sides have their unique flaws and problems, and I\u2019m in no way saying that in events like Charlottesville or the protesting of speakers at Berkeley,,  both sides were equal in their virtues and vices.   Okay. Almost done. Anyone who made it this far I appreciate for sticking it through lol.   Those of the center, right or center, left or center, the libertarians and social democrats who actually understand the true meaning of those ideologies, and the classic \u201csocially liberal, fiscally conservative\u201d trope I myself am guilty of using at times lol, I don\u2019t know how, but we need to fucking stand up.

{"text":"She didn't admit that she did it on purpose. Yes, she made a comment that is questionable but it's not an admission of guilt whatsoever.  That's just utter bullshit.  It isn't. She did make comments that are questionable but each and every single person quoting this conversation doesn't take into account the larger context of that stream. We have a singular statement that, while making fun of the marriage, doesn't implicitly say that she married the guy on purpose. While the rabid mob will not see that the same way, it is important to keep in mind the context of the quote in order to make it admissible in court.  But what every single person here seems to forget is that in order to be divorced, they need to justify their reasoning (including her situation that she is from another country) for filing divorce in Canada. So unless you believe that the Canadian system is so shit that she slipped through, she has been going through that in a legal manner and not get deported for it.    Additionally, the problem is that it's not an accusation alone. It calls for deportation directly, rather than an investigation, which implies that the people posting it consider her guilty without due process.   This is like you saying people shouldn't use the phrase \"break a leg\" as it implies self hurting, which it technically, but you could also stop taking the piss and realize what this is about, she admitted to a crime, we're asking for justice.  You are already pinning a guilty state on a person that made a comment and hasn't been charged with anything. You are pushing a narrative that someone **needs** to be deported while she hasn't been tried and convicted for what **YOU** claim she did wrong.  She may very well have done wrong and if that is the case then the legal system of Canada will take care of that. It is not up to you or anyone else other than an official judge to call for her deportation or any other form of punishment. That you do not understand this basic legal protection is exactly the problem here. It's not about what she said, it's about how you choose to **forego** legal procedure in favour of vigilante justice through societal slandering and accusations.   It doesn't matter who it is to me, it's the process that is being used by you people. It's that you allow this to happen that prompts a response.

I've lived in apartment complexes like that and I've had my car broke into twice, both at night. So let me try to make this as simple as possible for you. If they were out in broad daylight it wouldn't be suspicious, if they were by their porch or maybe a common area like a gazebo it wouldn't be suspicious. What makes it suspicious is that it's clearly dark out and they're hanging out in the parking lot. When is the last time you were with a group of friends and thought, \"Hey the parking lot seems like a great place to just hang out, we should go out there.\" It's just not a normal activity. As you said, they were waiting for AAA, that's not a normal activity. She was right to be suspicious and completely bungled the situation.  I also agree that they shouldn't have had to \"cower away\", but again think about the context. This lady is clearly not in a right state of mind. She's obviously intoxicated, it's best to not engage these kinds of people. You have no idea what an intoxicated person might do. She had a large purse, there could have been a firearm in there. Why would you risk escalating the situation?  You can't just ignore the context of what is happening here and just throw a race card out. Nothing I've described has anything to do with race. The situation could be reversed and I would say the exact same thing. Just stop and think about risk management in the situation. They have very little to gain and a lot to potentially lose. Why take the risk of arguing with the intoxicated lady?","label":0}

Last I heard, she also was going to try to sue but that didn't work out for her once the footage came to light. She had released a very limited version (what one of her friends filmed during this arrest) to the internet around June\/July, but when the rest of the footage was leaked she looked like an asshole.  The reason she didn't want to give her name? She was already on probation for something she did a year or so before, and knew that she wasn't supposed to be drinking because 1) She's underage and 2) It's illegal to have an open container on most beaches in the NY\/NJ area. If you're of age, there are people who drink but are smart enough to not get piss drunk and who don't leave it in an obvious container, neither of which this dimwit was smart enough to do.  When it came to light that she was already on probation, a habitual liar (who started the fight), a single mom at 18-19 that kept referring to the father of her kid as \"baby daddy\" (media had reported that they were still together, they were not, so she apparently had to make that clear?) and an overall shitty human with terrible decision making skills, things didn't work out the way she wanted. The media outlets were trying to go for a more wholesome \"Random mother attacked in front of her child and family for no reason\" and when it turned out that none of it was true, the story kind of died off. She made one half-hearted apology for getting caught up in her own lies, and that was that.  Real piece of human trash, that one.","label":0}

You honestly think there's a viewing market for watching cops pull over little old ladies to tell them they have a burnt out signal bulb? Of course not.  Secondly, what is happening in the US is more of a result of an agenda-driven media looking to keep the public on edge through pandering to the more ignorant of the viewing masses by exaggerating tensions between groups with opposing social structures. Utilizing fear, anger, and misinformation, much of the public and some members of law enforcement see the other as inherently evil, dangerous, and untrustworthy. Thereby producing a society where all persons are on edge, suspicious, and quick to judge with very little facts and information.","label":0}

{"text":"Okay I will bite.  for lying under oath would get punished the same as a typically very violent, and very physical act,   First off what is being referenced here is not punishment for a violent crime versus an non violent crime. What is being referenced is where no violent crime has taken place and on the word of the accuser a person is sent to jail. So perjury can net a person a long, as in up to a lifetime in jail, where the punishment for perjury when discovered is trivial. No one is arguing that a person should get a light sentence for a violent crime against anyone. Or that the sentences for violent crime and perjury should be the same.  imagine being so big of an unashamed illiterate, that you actually believe shit like this   Women receive far lighter sentences for the same type of crime as men across the board in all crime categories excluding none. Women caught committing the exact same crime as a man, ie she is a co-defendant, receive lighter sentences than their male co-defendants except in rare instances. The more severe the crime where both male and female defendants of the same crime the women will almost invariably receive years less in sentencing.   you have the fact that false rape allegations resulting in convictions aren't a widespread issue in the slightest according to just, well, virtually every credible authority on the subject  This statement is incorrect. The number of false rape accusations being detected has greatly increased since the hysteria that the rape culture movement created by feminists highlighted that blindly believing an accuser caused more victims to be created. The whole title 9 fiasco where due process was removed from accused highlights the failing in the mentality. As you have pointed out above any legal system worth it salt has due process as a foundation stone of its legal system.   Reading through your post history is pretty scary. You are a very angry person as pretty much all your posts revolve around you saying you are not a feminist and yet attacking and insulting anyone you converse with. Reminds me of saying, \"If all the world is full of assholes is it the world or you?\"  Anyways most of what you wrote above is based on your assumption that violent crimes and perjury should be looked at the same. That is not the case. The rest is just an emotional rant.  EDIT: I have given you flair. You are going to love it :)","label":0}

Brad Wardell's politics have been known for a long time, and if people were review bombing him over that, the would have done the same thing to GalCiv 3, which they have not.  Stardock is in the middle of suing the original developers of Star Control to prevent them from releasing a true sequel to Star Control 2 (which any reasonable read of all the stupid contract muck surrounding this whole thing indicates that they have every right to do).  This is after saying on multiple occasions while they were developing Origins that they were \"staying out of the original Star Control universe so that hopefully Fred & Paul (the original devs) can make a true sequel some day\" or something to that effect.  A lot of us Star Control fans were really excited that Stardock was going to be making a Star Control game, and we were *doubly* excited when Fred & Paul announced they were going to make a true sequel.  At this point now (contrary to what Brad and his cronies are claiming), Fred & Paul can't realistically even *start* working on their true sequel because they've got this lawsuit hanging over their head, and the settlement offer from Stardock says outright that they're literally never allowed to make another Star Control game again as long as they live.  If Star Control: Origins is being review bombed, I can essentially guarantee you that that's the reason.  The vast majority of the fan community would like to see both Star Control games, and many of us decided not to purchase Origins *specifically because of this ridiculous lawsuit*.","label":0}

My doctor put me on a stack of muscle relaxers and a somewhat-stronger Vicodin derivative. Point is, I understand how you could get addicted to that. The feeling was just so good.

{"text":"If you support the movement that is currently holding sway among the \"populist\" right wing - eg Trump fans, the \"alt right\"\/ \"alt lite\", popular online right-wing\/anti-progressive commentators eg Milo, Cernovich, Coulter, the Proud Boy movement - then you are inevitably throwing your hat in with the \"religious right\". It's those people and their supporters that have brought about the state of affairs we have today. And you may call yourself a liberal, or a libertarian, or even a \"non-political person who just wants to play games\" - but by standing in the way of liberalism and progressivism you are enabling those people, and ultimately taking their side in the debate.  Divide and conquer tactics. Not only that but you're completely inaccurate. The alt-lite, and even the alt-right, habitually go out of their way to transgress and shock the sensibilities of the religious right. Milo has openly rejected the religious right and is himself flamboyantly gay and married to a man, he's spoken about how he was a fan of Marilyn Manson back during the previous culture war, etc. Much of the alt-right is pro-abortion, some of it (including Richard Spencer himself) is accepting of gay people, and the entire alt-right worldview is incompatible with Conservative Christianity as it exists in the USA (the alt-right being rather anti-semitic whilst conservative Christians are philo-semitic).  Not to mention, *conservative Christianity is in both political and demographic decline*. Younger evangelicals, by the way, are less anti-gay than their elders, so the \"conservative Christians\" are being less conservative every day.   Your package-dealing of \"liberalism and progressivism\" is outright wrong on every level.  Is it really \"classist\" to disagree with someone because you don't think they are educated enough to understand what they're talking about?   Its classist to immediately dismiss them as racist because they don't use sufficiently eloquent terminology. You should at least try exercising interpretive charity.   The basic fundamentals of the issue are not complex, you don't need a college degree in sociology or theology to understand the principles. Tommy isn't conventionally educated but he isn't stupid, he knows what he is doing. Hence my phrase \"weasel words\".  Would you consider Douglas Murray racist then? Or bigoted? What about Bruce Bawer? Because I don't see them making substantially different arguments, they just use more educated language to do so.   I don't believe it is unfathomable bigotry. As a liberal progressive, I am quite happy to say that I think a lot of the principles of fundamentalist Islam are utterly abhorrent, and incompatible with modern, liberal society and values. I know for a fact all of my liberal progressive friends would say the same thing.  Then why do Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins... both broadly-speaking on the left... get accused of bigotry for saying *precisely that*? What about Bill Maher?  You *know* this happens.  What left wing\/progressives take issue with, is right wing political views which imply that ALL Muslims agree with those horrible and totalitarian ideals, and in particular with those that try to say that this \"fact\" means that Muslims shouldn't be in western \/ non-Islamic countries.  Apart from Pamela Geller and perhaps Milo, I don't know anyone who says this. Douglas Murray doesn't. Tommy Robinson doesn't. Harris and Dawkins don't. Christopher Hitchens never did. Maajid Nawaz doesn't (indeed, he's a Muslim). Ayaan Hirsi Ali doesn't (and she specifically repudiates such positions in her book *Heretic*). Almost all of these figures have been accused of \"racism\" and \"islamophobia\" however, by certain people on the left.  But you just need to go and look at comments on, say, Breitbart articles  Yes, comments on Breitbart articles are a fucking dumpster fire. But its exceptionally unlikely that *comments on Breitbart articles* will become the guiding lights of policy within the West. You know those people are exceptionally fringe.  the viewpoint that they should be entirely barred from the west (or indeed wiped from the face of the Earth altogether) is fairly established and unchallenged amongst the \"right\".  As someone who's been a libertarian for decades, has spoken with people from the left and the right, the idea that there should be a *blanket ban on all Islamic immigration into the west* is *anything but* accepted orthodoxy on the right. At most, I see arguments for civic values tests, enhanced screenings for links to terrorism, and in some cases temporary quantity caps or temporary pauses. And are you *fucking kidding me* about the idea that \"wiping Muslims off the face of the earth\" is somehow accepted orthodoxy on the right?!? *Libertarians, Paleoconservatives and Trumpists are all less interventionist than Neoconservatives* so that's even *less* likely to happen.   One or two ranters on *Breitbart* says nothing about actual policy platforms.   I am open minded enough to be able to see that there are elements of totalitarianist thought on the left - due to the fact that at the end of the day, society needs laws, to some extent, in order to function, and laws inevitably boil down to rights being restricted and freedoms being impinged.  That's not an open-minded viewpoint at all. Its a phony attempt at balance and you know it. The proper role of law is to *ensure* rights by prohibiting the *violation* of them. There is no \"right to murder\" and thus laws against murder do not violate anyone's rights.   Yes, society needs laws, but that's a vacuous truth.   You're ignoring the absurdly long history of totalitarianism on the left; every form of Marx-inspired ideology degenerated into totalitarianism. 20s\/30s\/40s progressivism, an ideology of the left, was essentially fascism with pseudoscientific pretentions. Auguste Comte was hardly a right-winger and his philosophy has been absurdly influential on the technocratic left; Comte was a devout totalitarian.   However in my opinion the extent of the left's totalitarianism extends to limiting people's absolute freedom of speech, when that speech has the potential to incite hate or harm against others.   \"Incite\" has a very particular meaning in law. It requires the advocacy of imminent lawless conduct. The left's proposed limitations on freedom of speech are much, much broader and include even books like Charles Murray's *The Bell Curve* (which is controversial but hardly inciteful).   The extent of totalitarianism proposed by the right - no abortions, no homosexuality  Bullshit. Again, there are libertarians (mostly pro-abortion, universally accepting of private sexual conduct), many of the populist-nationalist parties are pro-choice (for example Pauline Hanson's One Nation party in Australia... Hanson supports abortion on request), and the gay marriage issue is basically settled. The upcoming generation of Evangelical Christians are not only less numerous than the last, but also more accepting on gay marriage.  from comments on right wing outlets like BB its undeniable that many have these views  And these people aren't making the policy. Hell, they're more extreme than Breitbart's own writers.  -----  Your entire screed is nothing more than an attempt to deny the fact that the culture war has radically changed. You're still pretending that there are radical dominionists in the wings, when the reality is that the contemporary right has become substantially more secular and in some ways much more socially liberal than it used to be. As even Angela Nagle... an old leftist and author of *Kill All Normies* pointed out... the Alt-Right (and she was talking about the *actual* Alt-Right, not people like Sargon of Akkad) is a right wing completely devoid of Christian morality.  Trying to wave 90s-era culture war flags makes no sense in today's world.","label":0}

And I *would* if we still had slavery and it had never been overturned and I was talking to somebody who was trying to tell everybody the courts were anti-slavery. I might provide my own *moral* reasons to be against slavery...but yeah, a discussion of the law would require me to bring it up if the person was pretending the Supreme Court was against slavery when they had actually upheld it.   Rights are not based on morals. They're granted by the virtue of existing.  It's funny, you *say* that as if those two things conflict somehow. \"It's not morality! It's just a series of rules about behavior based on a human's intrinsic worth!!\"  What exactly is the reason to separate the two things, other than the word 'morality' obviously makes you mad, and reminds you of religion, which makes you *really really* mad?  It's a right derived from the need of the individual,   If it was derived from the need of the individual than progressives would be right in saying we have a basic human right to food and shelter and all that stuff, and the Gov't would be obligated to provide it. Rights aren't based on something as pragmatic as human needs, they are based on human worth and dignity.  If you're any sort of libertarian or conservative, then you believe primarily in *negative rights*; i.e., rules about what *other people aren't allowed to do to you*, i.e, morals.   Obscenity is the very definition of a group punishment upon the individual, the offense of others as a reason to inflict tyranny on the minority.  No more or less than any law that comes down to a group vote.  If you're going to cry 'tyranny' in every instance the minority doesn't get their way, you may as well rename judges as regents and give them the authority to rule over every aspect of our lives.   In the mean time, *Of fucking course* communities get to decide things like 'can you sell dildos in a school zone' based on the community's wishes (measured by voting), and of course histrionic language about tyranny doesn't actually change that.   Honestly, conservatives make me sick sometimes.  Yeah, that's clear. You should probably calm the fuck down and compose some better arguments if you're going to address one in the future.   Anyone that would lock up another human being for scribbles on paper should never speak of standing for anything resembling human dignity.  Like for example this ridiculous fucking strawman.  Here's another one: those degenerate libertarians make me sick sometimes.  They want every community on earth to look like a goddamned Bangkok red-light district, because apparently not being able to walk down the street of your home town without seeing people jerking off in public and screaming \"NIGGERFAGGOT\" at you is what freedom is supposed to feel  like.","label":1}

{"text":"Half of FFXV's story wasn't in the game. You needed to watch the anime and the movie. Even then the story just jumps and all that character development gets thrown in the bin, and we get a time jump.  The side stories are almost non existent, the character motivations are vague and not well fleshed out, the world feels empty, the NPC's are lifeless, the combat has the appearance of complexity but it's just an illusion, just warp strike everything with the warp strike sword to cheese the game.  A pretty game that has no depth.  Ever since FFXII the games seem to have forgotten story and relied on the player to read datalogs to know what's going on (even FFXII relied on diary entries too much IMO). Instead of showing the story it has these stupid encyclopedia entries to explain everything. 13's world felt empty because you interacted with almost zero other characters throughout the game other than the party members, 15 suffers from this as well. Characters enter and leave with almost no explanation of who they are.   6,7,8,9 and 10 created a world where the story took place in. It felt like a world. The NPC's seemed like they had a reason for existing. These later games have just a veneer that looks like a world but you scratch the surface and there is nothing there.

When it is agreed upon like in the old West that a man is responsible for his crimes it works great imo. The family vendetta you still see in Albania seems to work for them, but I wouldn\u2019t want my child to be killed because my brother raped a girl for instance. This would create pressure to keep your family in check so I see why people go with it.   It cannot work within a multinational state such as the US. \u201cReverse\u201d racism is a great example as to why it does not work. Modern White Americans are one of the least racially conscious groups. African Americans have a high racial consciousness. When when OJ was set free many Whites saw it as an injustice but they did not take retribution. When Trump was elected a retarded boy was tortured by blacks because he was White.

It would predicate that I buy their explanations that these are \"bot accounts\" when there's various examples where they call (even semi-prominent) people \"bots\", for instance like the UK government did to Syrian Girl recently: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iTsdizZjnyY or that they get their predictions of who's a \"bot\" right and don't just ban random Iranians sharing their opinions: https:\/\/twitter.com\/irmilitaryvlog\/status\/1032691906969591808  It would predicate that I accept the presumption that just because someone is Russian or Iranian they for some reason have less of a right to share their opinion or impart information on Twitter than if they were American or European and this automatically makes them somehow \"suspicious\".  It would predicate that I buy that there are \"large nefarious bot campaigns\" that want to change opinions in the West, and that these are somehow worse or more influential than the influence the Fake News media or bot networks in the west pushing specific messages or articles by said media: https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/DpVMOccW4AAkeAU.jpg:large https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/egMFE  I'm not ready to predicate any of those things, and seeing media and huge social media platforms call existing people \"bots\" to push a narrative, including at the beginning and throughout GamerGate I won't just \"take their word\" for it. As such, I'd rather concentrate on the more urgent and obviously apparent problems like the news media pushing Fake News and narratives (including those about \"Russian bots\") and social media giants censoring hundreds of thousands to millions of people for their political opinion, because they used the \"wrong word\" or because they're presumptually from a country that has been deemed a valid target for censorship on worldwide communication networks instead of looking into a few thousand accounts Twitter and the media is telling people to \"worry\" about.","label":0}

{"text":"The people who get called racist, xenophobic or \"right-wingers\" tend to be the ones who conflate all Muslims with radical Islamists.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Maajid Nawaz and even *Tommy Fucking Robinson* frequently make clear they aren't talking about all Muslims, and they frequently distinguish between \"Islamists\" and \"most Muslims in the west.\" They still get called \"radical racist xenophobic right-wingers.\"  The experience you will gain, backed with factual statistics, will show you that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and simply want to be left alone to get on with their lives.   The factual statistics also suggest that a very large percentage of Muslims are socially and theologically conservative, and would favor laws that restrict our civil liberties in the name of their religion. A survey of British Muslims found that a *supermajority* thought homosexuality should be criminalized.  Sure, they aren't necessarily *jihadists*. But if you believe in forcing society to live by Islamic norms *even via the ballot box* then you're an Islamist (\"Jihadists\" are Islamists who support terrorism as a means to forcing society to live by Islamic norms).   Yes, there are many Muslims whom are not Islamists. But we need to take the problem seriously. We saw the theocratic nonsense spouted by the religious right back in the George W Bush administration for the *threat it was*, and we didn't make excuses for them like \"but they're nonviolent, they want a democratic process to restrict our rights.\" Islamists should be viewed with the same suspicion, if not more, that was cast upon the Dominionists.  When people start making claims that \"all\" Muslims are jihadists, or being Muslim inherently means you are a violent extremist, or follow an extremist ideology - that's when you will get called racist, xenophobic or right-wing.  Again, not even Tommy Robinson supports that viewpoint. In addition, some people are *very eager to conflate* the proposition that \"some verses in the Quran and some theological positions that are prominent in the Islamic world logically support Jihadists\" with the proposition that \"all Muslims are violent extremists.\" Take a look at how Sam Harris was treated by Ben Affleck.

{"text":"**Here's a trailer \/ store review (or personal impression, if you will):**   The first contact with your game is through its title and short description, and they already tell me this is a politically charged game, and that the game takes a clear side in the culture war. At this point, I heavily suspect it will be heavy handed and preachy. My suspicions are reinforced after I start watching the video, as it contains too many \"buzzwords\" which makes it seem like it's a game aimed at die hard anti-SJWs only, and makes it feel too forced. Should be more subtle with these things.   The action and the written explanation on the store is not good enough to convey what the gameplay is about to most people. You should show and explain better the game mechanics. If people are confused about your game from the get go, they wont even bother downloading a demo, much less buying it to try and refund if they dislike.   The FAQ has a better explanation, but most users will not go out of their way and delve into the forum to try and figure out a game whose first impression was \"being weird\", \"clusterfuck\" or \"confusing gameplay\".  I obviously didnt play the game, but the feeling I get from the material presented is that the SJW theme is just a skin that could be ripped off from the game and it wouldnt change the experience one bit, or even make it better from not feeling so forced or preachy. It feels like an after thought since it doesnt seem like its integrated to the gameplay aspect of the game. You could turn this into an office battle royale themed around office rage and disfunctional work relationships and it would be all the same, or possibly work better.  I don't mean to sound harsh or anything, these are just my personal, unfiltered thoughts from my first contact with the store. In this context, my personal reaction would be to click \"not interested\" and ignore it.   Your game is competing for attention with not only thousands of others, but also with the backlog of each steam gamer. Your first battle is to grab the interest of the public to keep looking at your video or reading your description. Your second one is to aptly convey what your game is all about, how it plays and instill a desire on the user to go out of their way and buy it in a short video and \/ or description. As it is, the store lacks hooks and incentives for that.   i wish you good luck.","label":0}

It's also cruel & unusual.    An 11yo cannot consent, but it's also not violent forcible rape.  What would they do if she had committed violent forcible rape?  They can't give the death penalty, so they sentence her to 600 years?  60 is already a death sentence.  And if she got death for violent forcible rape, what about someone who rapes and kills 11yo children?  What are you going to do then?  This is nothing but stupid Texas virtue signalling.

Artikel 267 - belediging ambtenaar, openbaar gezag, hoofd bevriende staat De in de voorgaande artikelen van deze titel bepaalde gevangenisstraffen kunnen met een derde worden verhoogd, indien de belediging wordt aangedaan aan: 1\u00b0. het openbaar gezag, een openbaar lichaam of een openbare instelling; 2\u00b0. een ambtenaar gedurende of ter zake van de rechtmatige uitoefening van zijn bediening; 3\u00b0. het hoofd of een lid van de regering van een bevriende staat.  Zoals u kunt lezen is de eenvoudige belediging als uitzondering geformuleerd op smaad geformuleerd. Wanneer er geen sprake is van smaad, terwijl toch de eer en goede naam van een ander wordt aangerand, is er sprake van eenvoudige belediging.   In de tenlastelegging zien we bij belediging van een ambtenaar in functie vaak de volgende omschrijving:  hij op of omstreeks [datum] te [plaats], althans in het arrondissement Utrecht, opzettelijk beledigend (een) ambtena(a)r(en), te weten [ambtenaar] en\/of [ambtenaar 1] (respectievelijk brigadier en agent van politie Utrecht), gedurende en\/of ter zake van de rechtmatige uitoefening van zijn\/hun bediening, in diens\/dier tegenwoordigheid mondeling heeft toegevoegd de woorden \"Flikkers\", althans woorden van gelijke beledigende aard en\/of strekking.","label":0}

If that person were going to be punished, would their fear of that punishment allow them to come forward and elevate that guilt?  Probably not. So the innocent person in prison will continue to rot away in prison, and their innocent will never be known at all. To whatever degree it even allows.  It's not a pretty situation. There's never going to be one. Just as rape victims have to accept that sometimes real rapists will get away with it because of lack of evidence. Rape is the ugliest crime to deal with in the legal system for a reason. It's a mess, and will always be a mess.  There's no solution to the mess. We can only do the lesser of the evils when we decide what that is.   I was going to say that in a perfect world people would come forward and face the punishment for their crimes, but that's retarded. They wouldn't commit the crime at all in a perfect world. So we can't even get into that situation.   People aren't going to willingly come forward and face punishment. We live in a world where people rape, and people lie about rape. We can't ignore that just because you want to punish everybody who does the bad things.   Yeah, that would be nice if we could just punish bad people. But we can't, because if there were a punishment. Those bad people who lied about being raped would probably never admit they lied. Since they'd be punished.   Stop thinking so black and white.

{"text":"I don't share your positive outlook. However, I do think that the comparison to the evolution of art in the past two centuries is being mimicked by videogames.  Right now, we find ourselves in the post-modernist era of gaming, where some people are trying to figure out new ways to approach videogame development and playability, but generally speaking most participants are either cynical actors or snotty elitists that think their shit don't stink. And just like with post-modernist art, we are now seeing the kindling embers of the post post-modernism movement, with games such as Doom, BoTW, Mario Odyssey, RE7, SoulCalibur VI (and a few others), where the cynicism and corporate bullshit is worn-out, and the people involved just want to make games that core audiences have been begging for years, just updated to modern sensibilities and tech specs.  I'm sure you're now asking \"But isn't that good? We're getting rid of the trend-following ideologues, right?\", to which I say no, not really. See, post-modernism left a stain in the art world that will likely NEVER go away. Audiences, be them philistines or not, got it into their heads that being an artist means being a snooty cuntbag sniffing their own farts and making up excuses for pointless drivel. Critics, and the elitists in the art world, have also collectively agreed to circle-jerk that notion around. How's things going for post-post modernists? Not well, because even if their work is appreciated, even if it finds an audience, people just think of it as \"Oh right, classic-style art\", and don't give it any further thought, leaving new creators to either become another cog, or fall into obscurity.  Can this be solved? Well, the PPM in art is still going, under 30 years of existance, give or take, and only a FEW videogames fall into the equivalent state. But videogames are much more product-driven than Art, so the mediocrity of AAA shlock and the post-modernist douchecannoes flooding the market will still present a colossal challenge to anyone that doesn't have the backing of a major studio. I mean, Return of the Obra Dinn is kinda PPM, but it still doesn't much going for it, and doesn't seem to have much replay value.","label":0}

Personally, I don't think we should make a huge deal about under-21's drinking, but the law's the law, and here's why she's wrong:  She told the cops that she was   Being underage and in possession of alcohol is a crime (MIC).  When a police officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause of a person committing a crime, that suspect MUST identify themselves to the police.  They gave her the chance to show that an overage person was the one with the alcohol, which not only did she not take, but she was really rude to them when they were very patient with her trashy, belligerent, entitled behavior.     If you refuse to identify yourself at this point, you can be arrested - period.  By trying to walk away, she's evading\/resisting, and when she pushes the officer, now it's resisting arrest AND felony assaulting a police officer in addition to the MIC.  Then when she kicks the other cop (another count of assaulting a police officer), they treated her like they would any man, and rightly so.  Lastly,  when she tried (and failed) to spit on the officer, that's yet ANOTHER count of attempted assault of a police officer, as bodily fluids count in that category.  On top of that, the whole time she is screaming about how her child is there, using that child as a shield, etc., but the worst part is that's the example she's setting for her kid.","label":0}

I'm sure there were a lot more gay people who just didn't want to come out or were just still figuring things out, but I guess my point is that nobody went around pretending they were a celestial being, or a dog, or had a gender that was neither male or female.  Reading some of these stories, it's as if all that bullshit is basically the new fad now and in any given class of 30, you have 5 nonbinary kids, 7 gay kids, and 4 transgenders. Is this just made up bullshit, or are kids really falling for that crap? I'm not saying that all of them are phonies, but in the OP, it seems there are at least 3 queer people and one asexual person...

If they were there for crowd control, why, at the beginning of the video, were they all crowded into one corner? Thats bad crowd control tactics if you ask me. If this stuff rarely happens in Holland, why is the cop so afraid that this lady posses a massive, lethal threat? Punching people 4 times in the face, throwing them on the ground, kicking them while they are down is standard proceedure? Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? What the hell kind of country are you from? Punching someone multiple times, throwing them on the ground, kicking them, waving a baton around THEN arresting is THE most efficient way to handle her? Instead of, ya know, just tackling her and cuffing her?   The lady is absolutely in the wrong!!! I am not debating that! I am debating the cops use of excessive force\u2014 irregardless of the lady doing what she did. Cops are supposed to be better than the people they are arresting\u2014 according to you they don\u2019t have to be because \u201cit rarely happens here.\u201d What happens when it DOES happen there?

{"text":"A Warr Acres woman is accused of taking more than $450,000 from a man with Alzheimer's disease when she was supposed to be taking care of him.  Going back as far as 2011  So she has been doing this for 7 years.  After gaining power of attorney over him, police say Smith-Frawner began by deeding his Warr Acres home over to herself via quitclaim deed for just $  What the fuck.  According to court documents, she added herself to his bank account and, in 2015, started making withdrawals and writing herself checks. These include a $77,28 cashier's check \"used to pay off a BancFirst loan in the name of Cindy Smith in \" Another was a withdrawal posted to the victim's account in October 2017 in the amount of $29, That was a payment \"made to Honda Financial to pay off a 2016 Honda Accord that was registered to Cindy Smith.\"  The documents allege that in August of 2017, a $10,000 cashier's check from the victim's account went to Emerald Springs Spas \"for a down payment on a hot tub\" that was set up at Smith-Frawner's residence. The total price of the hot tub and accessories was $14, Smith-Frawner also took out a loan for the remaining balance from the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union, then a month later, $4,39 was taken out of the victim's account to pay off a loan at the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union.  Then, in October 2017, $295,000 was transferred from the victim's bank account to her personal account, one the victim did not have access to.  Investigators say the total equaled over $450, They note that that number does not include other suspicious transactions, the value of the house she allegedly did not pay for and a Chevy Avalanche that belonged to the victim.  Smith-Frawner is accused of taking most of the Navy veteran's life savings, and leaving him a little more than $40,  We did, however, speak to her attorney, Billy Bock, who insists the man cared for Smith-Frawner like a daughter, and knew about the transactions.  Everything was done under his wishes,\" Bock said. \"I understand he doesn't remember that now and it's sad. I wish he did.  My client did not knowingly deceive or defraud or take money away from [him] in any way other than what his wishes are,\" Bock said.  This lawyer sounds scummy at best.  Altogether, penalties could include 37 years in prison and $85,000 in fines.  This is all. This is bs. She will not get the max. My guess is she will get less than 10 years.   So steal $600,000+ and only have to pay back $85,  I am guessing the house was worth more than $100,000 dollars.  So the $450,000 + other transactions not included in the $450,000 + $100,000+ house = $600,   Investigators say the total equaled over $450, They note that that number does not include other suspicious transactions, the value of the house she allegedly did not pay for and a Chevy Avalanche that belonged to the victim.","label":0}

{"text":"Clearly, you didn't read the articles I posted.  I define SJW propaganda as ideologues who are terrible writers pushing their hard left politics into comics.  You called me alt-right, because - in your warped reality - you pretend that I'm asking for a comic book industry that mirrors the Matrix in the Matrix Revolutions; Everyone is a Smith Clone (aka white, straight male). Ask yourself: **Who wants to see that?**   For example, Vox Day is trying to capitalize on Comicsgate by creating more right-wing comics, or comics with right wing themes. Personally, I don't want to read his comics;   **I don't want right wing comics. I don't want left wing comics.**   I don't want to read comics where creators push their politics into it. All I want is what I grew up reading; apolitical, fun stories. By the way, when I say apolitical, I mean I don't want to read characters that are a mouth piece\/propaganda for political views and\/or shilling.   It's even worse when the writing is terrible.   There are tons of female characters that I love in comics (i.e. Motoko Kusangi from Ghost in the Shell, Kitty Pryde and Rogue from the X-men, Lois Lane from Superman, Mikasa Ackermann from Attack on Titan, Huntress from Birds of Prey, Raven from Teen Titans).  You know why I like these characters? Because they're awesome! The writers who write their stories do a good job, because they're good writers and are qualified. I can relate to some of them, and I enjoy watching them overcome their hardships.   Now, as far as race goes, at no point did I say I wanted an all white cast of characters (or creators). Do you think I want Storm (from X-men) to be white? I would be pretty annoyed if they did something that stupid, since her African ancestry has been an important part to her character (If you've read Life Death for example).   But here's the double standard; remember when Scarlett Johansson was cast as the Major for the live action Ghost in the Shell? Remember how angry people were, claiming that the Major is Japanese. They were talking about whitewashing!  Now, if that's the case, then why does nobody complain when white characters are changed (i.e. Jimmy Olsen in the Supergirl TV series, Perry White in Man of Steel, Mercy Graves in Dawn of Justice, Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movie, etc) in the mainstream?   Granted, these aren't the comics, but the principle is the same. I'll tell you why this is happening: *First of all, it's a blatant double standard.* Second, the people who do this claim that the race of the characters that they change is unimportant, and yet when the race of characters (who's race was unimportant in their own stories) are played by whites, they call it racist and whitewashing.  Worse yet, when ACTUAL fans point out the inconsistencies (because they **actually read\/buy the comics**), they are painted as racists by the mainstream media, or as crybabies.  So this tells me that the race swapping is a politically motivated move; they claim that \"people of color\" are underrepresented. This is all based on the politically motivated belief that white people are privileged, over-represented, and that minorities are being \"forced out\".   In other words, this boils down to the belief that \"whites are bad\", or that \"minorities are being exploited\/oppressed\". And the annoying thing about it is that the creators of these comics\/shows sometimes go out of their way to vilify anyone who points this out.  This is why certain legacy characters at Marvel are being overshadowed by minority counterparts (Miles Morales, Riri Williams, the Asian Hulk guy, the female replacement of Thor and Wolverine, etc). If you actually read the articles I posted, you'd see why these characters were created in the first place. Part of it was to boost sales, but in the long run, these characters have no depth, because what's being sold to us are FEMALE and NON-WHITE characters, not HEROES.   Who wants to read characters defined by gender and skin color? That's why the Alt-Right is annoying; nobody enjoys a character who's being sold for what they are. We like characters for WHO they are, not WHAT they are.   And before you say I contradicted myself, remember that the race\/gender swapping is a one way straight; the creators are doing this only change white\/male\/straight characters. And to make it worse, they openly insult this demographic for not liking the comics. What better way to sell comics than to insult a huge part of your reader base.  Besides, why do you think many fans hate the new Star Wars films? They brought back the original characters, and then killed of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. WHY? That's stupid! People who grew up with these comics are attached to the legacy characters (Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Peter Parker, etc). They put these characters in the movies, but the idea of making movies based on comics is to sell the comics. So when you buy the comics after seeing the film, and then the characters you watched are overshadowed in the comics by their sjw counterparts, or completely replaced in the comics by them. That's what we call a bait-and-switch. This doesn't even make sense in an economic sense.  I don't like Jessica Cruz because she's a coward who - in the beginning - was in a holding pattern of being an insecure coward, with little character development (until Dan Jurgens fixed that when he took over writing Green Lanterns; he actually created character development for the two stars, and made them enjoyable for once). It has nothing to do with her being female or Hispanic.  What's happening in the modern comic industry is that minority\/female\/LGBT characters aren't being treated as equals. They are instead being placed on a pedestal solely for their biological traits. In other words, giving characters special treatment and shoved into the foreground solely because of how they were \"born\". So, equality - if that was what was intended  - isn't even being achieved in this form.   The creators being hired to write characters that are the same race, gender, or sexuality as themselves in stupid. Just because you're gay, doesn't mean you can write good gay characters. In fact, it doesn't even mean that you're a good writer at all. Being a good writer should be the sole requirement for writing a character.  I could go on forever, but here's my overall point: I don't want a comic book industry\/titles that look like Agent Smith's Matrix. I want good writing, good characters that are interesting to read, creators that are qualified as writers\/artists, and characters are aren't a political tool\/mouthpiece for hard left creators. I just want apolitical (in other words, no propaganda) fun stories, like what I used to read when I was younger.   I like super hero comics. I don't like SJWism. I don't like being preached at by hard left liberals (or alt-right people, for that matter).","label":0}

When really they were starving the dog until it started pissing in the corner and then they punish the dog for peeing in the corner instead of giving him what they know he wants\/needs.

{"text":"You're effectively saying that it's better to be healthy and rich than ill and poor. Hypovitaminosis is a thing, so are many microelement defficiencies. If you have suspicions, you can spend hundreds of dollars on blood tests, completely remake your dietary routine or buy $5 worth of supplements to see if things improve within a couple of weeks.  If you suspect you have a vitamin deficiency you should see a doctor because, again, healthy people do not develop vitamin deficiencies.  Anyone with a vitamin deficiency in the Western World needs to be checked for various GI absorption or metabolic issues.  As someone noted above, iron deficiency in women of child-bearing years being the major exception.      On a large scale those 5$ of vitamins add up over time and for the vast majority of people they are utterly worthless.  The turmeric, ginseng, and various combinations of 11 herbs and spices everyone raves about are an order of magnitude more worthless.  The idea that someone can self diagnose hypovitaminosis by seeing if they feel better is really dangerous advice.  That sort of subjective interpretation is incredibly prone to attribution errors.  On day 4 of your cold you take zinc on the internet's advice. Lo and behold three days later you're better!  Must have been the zinc!  Here's what Johns Hopkins has to say about multivitamins for healthy elderly: https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/health\/healthy_aging\/healthy_body\/is-there-really-any-benefit-to-multivitamins    Harvard has a slightly more nuanced take: https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/mens-health\/do-multivitamins-make-you-healthier    The NIH has something sorely lacking from most discussions, a brief talk about the RISKS of supplementation: https:\/\/nccih.nih.gov\/health\/vitamins    Editorial from the Annals of Internal Medicine: http:\/\/annals.org\/aim\/fullarticle\/1789253\/enough-enough-stop-wasting-money-vitamin-mineral-supplements      And the US Preventative Services Task Force: http:\/\/annals.org\/aim\/fullarticle\/1832969\/vitamin-mineral-multivitamin-supplements-primary-prevention-cardiovascular-disease-cancer-u    https:\/\/www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org\/Page\/Document\/RecommendationStatementFinal\/vitamin-supplementation-to-prevent-cancer-and-cvd-counseling      A far more nuanced answer than I was being above would be: Iron and folic acid for young women, calcium for older women, and vitamin D maybe for everyone.  The rest, especially the herbal nonsense that gets lumped in with vitamins is BS.

More of a protected class, that among other things were protected from having to be in charge and do difficult things. \"Women, at least the ones of your tribe\/race or country were typically respected unless they were slutting around and possibly fucking with public health and societal cohesion. Now, other people's women? Well the other people aren't human so how could their women be? Rape the shit out of them, they are only animals after all.\"  Pretty much how people thought I reckon. Funny thing as I understand it even in the early 1900s a lot of women didn't want to be involved in politics in any way even voting, as they wanted to do it correctly and that's a lot of effort to look into those running, or they saw it as all underhanded crooked nastiness and they didn't want any part of it.  That's a lot of time and effort that could be used for important things, like oh I don't know **their fucking families!**  The only ones who seemed to give a shit were barren or rich bitches who basically had poor women raise their children for them(not really the best idea) didn't have to tend house either as they had servants for that too and were bored. That's why normal women didn't really give much of a fuck for feminist bullshit until public schooling both came around and as largely mandatory and they had appliances to take care of most of the house work. Then they got bored.  Seems to me that the fucking government should stop trying to take women's jobs from them.","label":0}

{"text":"When the Cold War ended, Russia stopped flying bombers loaded with live nukes. The USA did not. The USA has expanded NATO into former Warsaw Pact nations to the point where NATO exists on Russia's doorstep. US\/NATO strategy of containment is still being used where both Russia and China are essentially surrounded by military bases. Like I mentioned, drills are done in Latvia. Defense missiles are placed in Romania.  In the 90's Russia embraced America. They wore blue jeans started listening to our rock and roll. However the Kosovo War happened. Russia didn't use its UN Security Council veto on the grounds that NATO wouldn't use air power to bomb Belgrade. They did. The Russians saw this as a massive betrayal of trust and it's what allowed Putin to rise to power.  Russia was supportive of NATO going into Afghanistan. In fact one of Russia's few military bases is on the other side of the northern Afghan border. The supply lines for our troops there came from Russia, and the Russians used their military presence to prevent the Taliban from running north. However Russia opposed the Iraq Invasion, and used that invasion as an excuse to invade Georgia and Chechnya. \"If the US can do it, so can we.\" Was their reasoning.  In the Obama years when the US, France and etc. did their campaign in Libya, Russia was strictly opposed to a no fly zone so medical supplies and such could be aired in. Clinton said there would be no fly zone. Russia didn't veto the intervention in Libya. What happened? Again the USA lied.  Then you have what's going on in Syria. We have had many, many close calls in Syria between the USA and Russia. Dangerously so. You have the perfect conditions for a single fuck up to spiral into WW Remember all it took was one guy getting shot to spark WW I think the Russians and Americans operating in the area in Syria are likely in communication with each other for this exact reason, so they aren't stepping on each other's toes.  I believe that NATO has been particularly belligerent towards Russia. Russia has absolutely no reason to trust us, and I don't blame them when they take matters in their own hands in matters of their own security.","label":0}

It's one of those 'gun channels' youtube seems to be more and more frowning upon.  In their particular case I find it kind of odd since they have a very limited and very focused concept on simply testing all kinds of weird and wonderful shotgun rounds.  It is in fact mostly a highly analytical channel, you give them a type of round and they shoot it at various objects to see how it performs.  There isn't any narrative or agenda being pushed, it basically just does what it says on the box.  *[edit] I'd like to qualify that statement by pointing out that they are situated in California, with California gun laws in place, and they do rather regularly make fun of that situation.*  &nbsp;  The reason I'm mentioning all that is because while I know they've been sort of in conflict with youtube lately and very much disapprove of how youtube is handling them and other gun related channels without any sort of consistency, it really kinda surprised me that it would be them breaking the story.","label":0}

Also, calling those women's rights activists \"feminists\" and their adversaries \"anti-feminists\" is not always accurate, as feminism is an explicit ideological position with a rich theoretical foundation (whatever any individual may personally think of that foundation) and not simply any effort to make things less shitty for women.   So I suspect that's what they are getting at, but I also do think it's important to not allow self-identified feminists in the west to claim the glory by proxy of serious political actors in other parts of the world by simply hanging their label on them unchallenged when it may not be accurate.","label":0}

{"text":"This one was by far the most damning :  The Progressive Stack: An Intersectional Feminist Approach to Pedagogy  In the name of Maria Gonzalez, Ph.D. (fictitious) of the (fictitious) Feminist Activist Collective for Truth  (FACT)  Discipline\/subdiscipline: feminist pedagogy (philosophy of education)  Summary: This is our most appalling paper, and it\u2019s deeply concerning that how it is being treated at the highly respected journal Hypatia. It forwards that educators should discriminate by identity and calculate their students\u2019 status in terms of privilege, favor the least privileged with more time, attention and positive feedback and penalize the most privileged by declining to hear their contributions, deriding their input, intentionally speaking over them, and making them sit on the floor in chains\u2014framed as educational opportunities we termed \u201cexperiential reparations.\u201d  Purpose: Patently unfair, inhumane, and abusive treatments of students will be acceptable in educational theory if it is framed as an opportunity to teach them about the problems of privilege.  Note: This paper insists that the most privileged students shouldn't be allowed to speak in class at all and should just listen and learn in silence throughout the term. Even more, it insists that students with high privilege could benefit from adding on \u201cexperiential reparations,\u201d such as sitting in the floor, wearing chains, or intentionally being spoken over, as an educational \u201copportunity\u201d within the class. The reviewers\u2019 only concerns with these points so far have been that (1) we approach the topic with too much compassion for the students who are being subjected to this, and (2) we risk exploiting underprivileged students by burdening them with an expectation to teach about privilege. To correct for this, the reviewers urged us to make sure we avoid \u201crecentering the needs of the privileged.\u201d They asked us to incorporate Megan Boler\u2019s approach called \u201cpedagogy of discomfort\u201d and Barbara Applebaum\u2019s insistence that the privileged learn from this discomfort rather than being coddled or having their own experiences (suffering) \u201crecentered.\u201d It also utilizes Robin DiAngelo\u2019s now-famous concept of \u201cwhite fragility\u201d to explain why students subjected to this treatment will object to it, and uses that to justify the more cruel treatment suggested by the reviewers. The reviewers acknowledged that they believe this \u201cfragility\u201d is the correct interpretation for student pushback against being told to stay silent and sit in the floor, possibly in chains, throughout the semester.  Notes on Status:  Three times \u201creject and resubmit\u201d at Hypatia  (This status means that the journal is interested in the paper but does not consider it successful enough to put on track for acceptance. It\u2019s weakly positive.)  Selected Reviewer Comments:  \u201cThis is a solid essay that, with revision, will make a strong contribution to the growing literature on addressing epistemic injustice in the classroom. The focus on the Progressive Stack is interesting yet focused and it is great that the author is trying to suggest some specific approaches.\u201d -Reviewer 1, first review, Hypatia  \u201cI like this project very much. I think the author\u2019s insights are on target and I think that the literature on epistemic injustice has lots to of er classroom pedagogies, I encourage the author to continue working on this project.\u201d -Reviewer 2, first review, Hypatia  \u201cThis is a worthwhile and interesting project. The essay is just not ready yet.\u201d -Reviewer 2, second review, Hypatia","label":1}

The first poster campaign **already** achieves this by showing not telling.      I'm curious from a social experiment perceptive as to what would actually happen.        You would undermine the message and effect of the original poster campaign.    In a perfect world, this would generate as much media attention, and could even prompt a dialogue that could lead to people developing insight.      The original message is already doing this. It's already revealing the media bias and getting racist people to out themselves. You can't improve on success and you can't speed up the process, you can only fuck it up.    Although I'm pretty sure posters saying \"it's not okay to be white\" would just be par for the course, and may not ruffle any feathers.       This is what the media wants to see, something they can't concretely hold up as having a negative and potentially threatening message. IOTBW as is, achieves all its goals, it's a honeypot for anti-white racists and it works perfectly. You can't improve on it.

{"text":"You raise a lot of valid points but also assume a great many things.  First of all, the hard left -- who are essentially being led, knowingly or not, by a long-run communist insurgency -- only have command over *derive*.  The rest of us -- who are being branded as \"the right\" and all its variants (now even including Alan Dershowitz, for crying out loud), which includes the actual right -- have command over  *d\u00e9tournement*.  That has created an impasse.  It's not a stalemate, because active hostilities rage.  But neither side is really making progress.  *D\u00e9tournement* allows all us anti-commies to hijack, derail and reroute ideas almost at will, while *derive* allows the commies to dominate any space they're able to gain entry into, be those real, virtual or corporate.    This is also different than historical radical movements, when the radicals commanded both strategies, but in a far weaker form due to much stronger institutions and cultural norms.  The online aspect changes the dynamics, but not as much as everyone claims.  For example, in the 2016 election, social media influence was ranked between 3rd and 7th in studies I've read in terms of significance in an individual's actual decision whether to vote and how to vote.  The stronger variables, by far, are still what they've always been:  family, community, peer-pressure (from flesh and blood people), faith beliefs, personal lived experiences, etc.  Fat feminist avatars shouting racist or cartoon frogs on twatter turn out to have virtually no measurable effect besides the latter enraging octogenarian boomer harpies who still can't grock that their Kween Killary hasn't been given her rightful Krown yet.","label":0}

{"text":"First comment from a LTL, but this one is triggering as hell.  Non-english speaker, so please excuse the following train wreck.  The sheer amount of arrogance and virtue signaling is strong enough to wake up the old ones from their endless sleep in the abyss. I just can't understand how one could decide to write a 6 paragraph long essay shitting on one of the most prolific authors in his genre, while thinking it would have any other results than making her look like an entitled brat.  &#x200B;  I mean, there is so much wrong with this garbage:   H.P Lovecraft was a racist \\[...\\] so are his stories.   I would agree on that one, but I'm sensing the inability of Mrs Greer to distinguish between the actions\/thoughts of the characters in the novels and the actual thoughts of Lovecraft.  I've read a great (great) amount of HP.L works, and some of his stories could definitly be interpreted as racist. Some of them are better than others. Some of them are just bad. It *doesn't* mean we have to throw away his work like a piece of trash, while praising the god of virtue for this sacrifice.   what Lovecraft gave to the genre of cosmic horror was his hate   Well, I guess I'll just admit that as well, afterall, it's written on the internet so it must be true.  &#x200B;   Which is now video games' problem.   Oh ... I thought it was harassment and misoginy. Now it's a matter of tentacles and white male heroes.  For decades video games have been regurgitating the themes, plots and aesthetics of his stories with not one ounce of scrutiny.   Indeed, we live under a Lovecraftian patriarchy that's ruling over the video games' kingdom ...   \\- *Silent hill maybe ?*    *- No! Examples and logic are the tools of the oppressors !*  the troubled white male heroes that contain his arrogance and his gross simplification of mental illness are recreated in video games with no subversion, no critical thinking   Says the girl who's calling for a ban whithout having substantial knowledge of the subject.  But I guess next time I encounter a three headed shoggoth, I'll try not to run and overcome my will of simplification.  &#x200B;   Here's the other thing. It's not just deeply problematic, it's boring.   This is *litterally* becoming a statement from the fun police.  *\"This is NOT fun, you hear ?!\"*  Thing is, I would agree that *seing* the same stuff over and over again could become quite boring in the end, but what's cool about the novels is that they are, you know ... novels. And immagination is a waaay more resourceful friend than any rendered monstrosity, when it comes to fear and despair.  &#x200B;   It's time to let go of Lovecraft   Jawohl mein Kommandant.   No more tentacled multi-eyed monstrosities, no foggy fishing towns or ancient aliens posing as gods.    There. Here it is. I'm almost certain she googled \"Lovecraft novels\", pulled the two tops results (I'd say A*t the moutain of madness* and *The Shadow over Innsmouth*), read the backpage ... aaaaand we're done. \"Look at me, I'm an HPL expert now !\". When people appeal to the most obvious tropes of a genre that's definitly richer and more complex, you know they're dumb as hell, or playing so to convey their message.  Sidenote: I should write a paper on that, denouncing the *litteral* rape of the reader when exposed to Lovecraft's work. I'm pretty sure I'd get published.  Because let's remember, the things people say they love about Lovecraft's work? \\[...\\] they don't belong to him.    This is so fucking stupid. \"Let's move on. Because let's remember, the things people say they love about Mozart's work? The violins? The sense of beauty and emotion? Guess what, they don't belong to him. NEEEXT !\"  &#x200B;  The paragraph on Soma is the least retarded of all, although I would question her understanding of existentialism (I'm not sure to what she is refering to since it can have different meanings in my language).  Opposing SOMA to HPL is quite dumb though: both explore many of the same topics, but uses different ways of doing so.  It should also be noted that you can easily swap SOMA and HPL work in her critique to get an inverted results that still sound (it doesn't, but it looks like so), due to the lack of examples and actual work.  &#x200B;   It's proof that not only can existential horror do without Lovecraft's dusty old tropes, it can flourish.   A yes, the goodol' \"we can do without\". Suit yourself, and bring me some non binary horror story that I can thrill with. For the time being, I'll dwell in my *hatred* driven world.  &#x200B;","label":0}

Because once you've read a book by a person who believes things that you don't believe you immediately realize that your viewpoint isn't worth shit compared to the reality that we collectively experience.   I spent 2 sec to google [\"non-binary person interview\"](http:\/\/lifeoutsidethebinary.com\/post\/91182016548\/interview-with-a-nonbinary-person-about-their) and here's just one of 10 million results. If you want to sit through a poorly-edited highly-slanted view of events I'm sure Buzzfeed has made a dozen youtube videos about nonbinary people. Just like all other perspectives you expose yourself to you will have to be a critical thinker (which I think we can all agree on considering this is the GamerGate subreddit). There are no \"right books;\" there are only books. There are no \"right perspectives;\" there are only perspectives. Some people's perspectives are informed and compassionate. Some people's perspectives are uninformed and uncaring. Who's viewpoints do you value?  Make choices. If you want respect then give it. If you want condemnation then spit it at others. If you want ignorance then spread it around. Everybody has choices. And we should all respect each others' personal choices because none of us are right about this world.  Hope that helps.

But from when we were hunting mammoths to relatively recently (and currently and into the future, just for less men percentage wise), having to sit and face all the horrible shit you were exposed to just to keep you, your family, and your tribe alive would shut you down.

Let me know how positive your reception is. Odds are you'll be derisively called an \"MRA\" and shown the door.  I have, and usually I\u2019m not the first one. Never been called an MRA for talking about equality on a feminist page    NOW fights against this, often with arguments about how joint custody is merely a tool that men use to abuse their former spouses.  They fight against the loopholes that people can use when they\u2019re abusive so they can\u2019t use their children as a way to keep abusing a partner (which actually does happen \ud83d\ude31) focusing on certain circumstances doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want any normal fathers to be in their children\u2019s lives     Katherine Spillar openly said she considers \"domestic violence\" to be a clean-up word for \"wife-beating\". In interview with Cassie Jaye, she openly said \"it's not women beating up men, it's men beating up women\".   She\u2019s saying what she sees. The people seeking help are almost always women, and so she made her own commentary about it. I personally wouldn\u2019t say domestic violence just means men beating women, it obviously goes both ways. But I guess since me and her have different opinions that means feminism is bullshit. Meh \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f    Most formulations of legal parental surrender involve surrendering your rights and responsibilities before childbirth. Feminists seem to flip their shit at that idea, as well.   Some do. I think if the father makes it clear that he won\u2019t take responsibility before 12 weeks then it should be okay.   That said, single mothers do have the right to have a child and then decide they don't want anything to do with it with no repercussions.  Do you mean abortion or adoption..?     Did you even read your source? It says right there that Odeh was convicted of the bombing, and bomb-making materials were found in her home. The only counterpoint is that Odeh herself insists she was innocent. I'm somehow not convinced.  Did you read it? It says she was physically and sexually tortured into giving a confession.   I\u2019m not diving into the back story of every woman associated with feminism in all of history. I simply believe in equality and feminists are the people who are the most vocal about intersectional injustices. But I guess because some lady may have bombed a place in another country that makes feminism void lol","label":0}

Although the sexual revolution made important advances regarding freedoms, it equated liberation with sexuality. Women's liberation slowly became about doing whatever a woman wants, whenever they want, and without consequence.   Consumerism also caters to women's materialism and preys on a man's wallet. Although women have always been the same, this combination of new technologies, consumerism, and sexual liberation has allowed women to get around like the world is ending next week.

Four years ago, Kavanaugh himself [reminisced about binge drinking in college](http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/la-na-pol-kavanaugh-drinking-20180925-story.html) and his [high school yearbook was full of references to alcohol](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/09\/24\/business\/brett-kavanaugh-yearbook-renate.html) and the attitude and decision-making behind the \"Renate Alumni\" thing is horrific. And let's get real, [Brett Kavanaugh was definitely the inspiration for \"Bart O\u2019Kavanaugh\"](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2018\/09\/27\/mark-judges-book-validates-christine-fords-timeline-alleged-kavanaugh-assault\/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2affad39e45e) in Mark Judge's book.  Ok, share.  I'm not sure what you're asking me.  I don't have to.  I don't understand what you're trying to say here. Again, it's hard to get a bearing on what you're saying because you're really not making any points. What makes you believe that Ford would have stepped forwards when she was 16 if the story is true? You seem to agree that we know not all women do who later seem to have valid claims, so not having stepped forward does not necessarily mean the story is made up.  It's within the scope of the FBI's powers to give a report to the Senate, because that was the background check. You are telling me to cite (not \"site\" btw) a source that the FBI has the authority to produce a background check that was requested of it for the Senate.  She was fine for his entire career before he was nominated.  Yes, dude. Do you not know what a civic duty is? It's an obligation not to yourself, but to your country, a burden of good citizenship like voting or serving on a jury. The transcripts are online, but the relevant sentence of Ford's testimony is, \"I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault.\" You could have consulted a dictionary or listened to Ford's testimony.  This happened to both of them.  Again, the civic duty thing changed the balance. I think (hope) that we agree that these kinds of allegations should not be made lightly and should not be taken lightly. The consequences of both airing out a false allegation and of suppressing a real one are severe. It's inherently a balancing act, so, yes, both of their lives are now set before the court of public opinion. Kavanaugh, however, is a public figure, so he put himself out there by nature of his occupation choices, but that's a minor point. I think the bigger point is just that *this is the nature of our adversarial system of law.* The point I was trying to make about the embarrassment and publicness of these allegations, investigations, and prosecutions is not that they shouldn't happen (although we should be cautious, and they've kind of gotten out of hand recently), but that they are an understandable deterrent. I'm not making an argument for whether or not it should change. That's a whole other conversation. I'm making the argument that in light of this, it is understandable why a real victim might not step forwards *until the added conviction that it is her civic duty* tipped the balance in favor of stepping forwards even so many years afterwards.  You're missing the point about the supplemental FBI investigation. It was excessively limited in scope and a weak defense for the argument that Kavanaugh never did any of the things alleged. Avenati's trashy (he was Stormy Daniels' attorney, for reference), but that was a side-comment\/personal opinion and no excuse for the FBI not even interviewing him or his client. Do you really believe that the supplemental investigation was sufficient? What makes you believe that?  I don't think you follow the news, dude. I heard the 20% thing on NPR, but you can Google it, or just do the math on the source I did cite you to immediately afterwards yourself. I'm in law school, so I'm also busy. I didn't listen to all of the testimonies live, but I did stream it afterwards. You're getting defensive because you haven't kept up with this issue as well as you could have. No, I don't know if they listened to the whole thing, but it gives you a ball park of how much of the country was tuned in *when you weren't*.","label":0}
{"text":"I'll admit, I find the idea strange that you'd play an FPS solely for who you'd be shooting, but can't say i'd be against the idea (more indifferent, if it's a good shooter, sure why not?). Although i'm not American so it's hardly a bold statement for me to say.  Be fine with a good shooter where my country is the villain too, if that helps.  But yeah, would be interested in the reaction. There's certainly been some games that have flirted with the idea, plenty of ones where Government elements of the US have betrayed you (Spec Ops, Binary Domain, the list goes on). But the country as a whole? Could be fun. Going guerilla style against far more advanced foes tends to be limited to more sci-fi foes, but having to deal with a modern american military as some middle eastern or what have you could be interesting, if pulled off well. Throw in the capacity to use more terroristic actions like hostages as practically a necessity to survive against far more well-armed foes. No doubt there would be an outcry (probably from both sides honestly, since the \"good\" guys would still be doing despicable things even if the game tries to show it in a slightly nicer light), but aahh well.","label":0}

Don\u2019t EVER make any stupid decisions while you\u2019re inebriated otherwise you are a hypocrite.   Now, I didn\u2019t put words in your mouth, I asked you questions. Feel free to try to actually answer them next time before trying to read me like a book and make assumptions about me (ironic, huh?)   You\u2019re ONLY thinking about the safety of the cops here while also saying that violence against cops almost never happen there. Jesus christ, have some humanity dude. This lady posed literally no threat to 6 trained officers\u2014 oh boohoo the cop got a bruise on his arm. This lady could be a vegetable for the rest of her life after the blows that cop delivered to her face and you\u2019re totally fine with it\u2014 you even support it.    Now, if this was a link to an article saying \u201cwoman sentenced to \u2018x\u2019 years for assaulting officers\u201d I would be right there with you\u2014 it isn\u2019t. Instead, its a cop using an excessive amount of force to apprehend one, singular drunk lady while 5 of his counterparts stand within striking distance of both of them. And you\u2019re all cheerin it on. You all just watched a women get the snot beat out of her because she took some drunken swats at an officer. If this lady posed a legitimate threat, then I would also be with you\u2014 she clearly doesn\u2019t. She gets tossed around like a rag doll all throughout the video. You guys keep talking about the \u201cpotential\u201d threat she posed, how about we talk about the ACTUAL threat she posed which, according to the vide evidence, was slim to none. The officer got a few scratches. Boo fuckin\u2019 hoo. Here\u2019s a band-aid.   It may be legal, but that doesn\u2019t mean its right. The lady engaged in the violence, and the cop was sure to retaliate with thrice the amount of pain and ten times the amount of possible destruction that he could have caused on her and her life.   Let me ask you the same question I asked another guy, and please actually respond to this one: what do you do if you see an officer beating your wife\/daughter\/mother. You don\u2019t know why the officer is there, he just is and, boy, is he rocking your loved one. Do you just stand by and shrug your shoulders? What if he kills your mother\/girlfriend\/aunt because of too much trauma to her brain? What then? Is he officer still in the right?","label":1}

{"text":"Among the stupid shit Verhoeven added, changed, or left out to make it look bad.   Conscription is banned in the Terran Federation, ( I'm pretty sure it applies to the movie but it is never explicitly stated or stressed ), not only that, but you can quit anytime you want, even right before a combat drop (Though you won't get your citizenship). Heinlein was very critical the American Military's use of conscription and devotes several paragraphs to deconstructing it and even name drops the then contemporary Korean war as an example. All the more ironic when you consider Verhoeven's own misgivings about the american military.   In the book, the mobile infantry is an elite army utilizing orbital drop-pods, and power armor with enough fire-power to level city blocks, ( A formation with soldiers a kilometer apart is considered and dangerous risk for friendly fire, and at one point Rico uses mini nukes ) Essentially being WH40K Space Marines in all but name ( Minus genetic modification). That Is why they fight without tanks or artillery, which are explicitly stated to be obsolete compared to an M.I. soldier. The movie instead makes the M.I. look like the WH40k Imperial guard if it was led by Zapp Brannigan, rushing masses of ill equipped soldiers like a moron.   You don't need to be a citizen to have children. The only rights a citizen has over a civilian is the right to vote or run for office in the Terran Federation.   There are other forms of service apart from the military one can sign up for that will grant  citizenship, though they are similarly dangerous, dirty, and grueling.   The Bugs are a technologically advanced race with an interstellar empire, not just some wildlife on an isolated planet. The attack on Sao Paulo is most definitely *NOT* a false flag, as the movie implies.   No attention is given in the movie to the near non-existance of racism, racial strife or sexism between humans in the Terran Federation. Units are mixed with people from all ethnicities and cultures. The Main character Juan Rico is in fact Filipino, though even book readers might miss this, as it is only inferred through two random lines where he mentions [Ramon Magsaysay](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ramon_Magsaysay) and that he speaks tagalog. Obviously Verhoeven couldn't let people think that anything other than globohomo peace and tolerance hippie ideals will lead to a internally peaceful society.    For the M.I. recruiting office, they hire only the most crippled and mangled veterans they can find. The one Juan Rico meets is missing half his face and 3 limbs. His job to scare away anyone who isn't really dedicated and to make it very, very clear what dangerous dirty and grueling life you will have in the M.I. which itself is *extremely* selective, only %9 of Rico's starting group is able to pass and complete training. There is no propaganda machine brainwashing people, and there are no illusions given that service will be anything but dangerous, dirty and grueling. ( this is somewhat related to points 1 and 2 )","label":0}

{"text":"It amazes me that this topic gets so much vitriol. He's talking about rape *culture*, not rape. He's not saying rape doesn't happen, just that the US cannot be considered a rape culture. The way people engage with this is by sobbing apparently, and that's absurd. That first idiot kept saying \"I've been raped and I know people here who've been raped, that's not 1 in 1000!\" That's not how statistics work! Honestly, I feel bad for these people. They seem to honestly think that our culture condones rape. I'd be pretty nettled too, if I believed that. I'd probably be rather stressed out all the time if I lived in the Middle East.   The argument that makes sense is that sometimes institutions protect rapists because of the status of the rapist. But the thing that people miss is that *everyone hates when institutions do this*. It's not like a college protects it's star running back and everyone's like \"welp, all's well that ends well.\" No, people lose their fucking minds! People still talk about *Brock Turner* because he got off too easy on a rape charge. People ought to start asking college kids what needs to be done to eliminate rape culture, so that we could get better insight into what they think it is. It's inevitably going to be something like \"we ask women what they were wearing\" or \"people who get accused still have running water\". It's completely disconnected from reality.","label":0}

He's supposed to be a barbarian type, a viking vampire brute, yet he talks about real concerns that he has over real issues related to vampire society, all the while constantly acting like a retard.  All those issues he brings up, could have been given to any other of the cardboard cut-out vampire generals to bring up, actually flesh them out a bit instead of just being stand-ins, and leave Godbrand to be the brash douchebag that still accidentally ruins part of Carmilla's plans.  Let's go even a step further: why the fuck was Dracula so adamant in genocide, yet did nothing but mope around like fucking Gabriel in LoS? Yes, the character does not REALLY want to sully his hands due to the conflicting feelings he has, but he didn't really have to do the work himself, and the show goes out of its way to demonstrate that he WOULDN'T do it himself. So why is the almighty lord of darkness, the king of fucking vampires, not cracking the whip on the Vamp Spice Girls and telling them \"Do this, do that, no questions\"? Something that, in turn, would make Carmilla's scheming actually mean something, because she would have to find a way around Dracula's unbreaking resolve, and twist his plans to fit her agenda.  And if you want an aswer: you can say the exact same thing about Darling in the FranXX, that \"it was the point\", but the inconsistencies and faux depth don't make that show any less shit, and definitely do not help in regards to Castlevania, even if it's still a good show, IMO.","label":0}

{"text":"nobody can ever put pressure on the SQLite team, in any form whatsoever. outside of Hipp himself waking up one day and deciding \"hey now we're woke af fam\", basically nothing can make them budge. the consulting company selling support is himself & partners, the code is public domain but not open t o contribution, and they're very very much financially independent thanks to the two billions plus device the software is deployed on.  however, using the occasion be a cheeky cunt, while i didn't peg the character as it, it wouldn't surprise me that much. woke tech twitter has been fuming over that, which gotta give a hearty chuckle to anybody that can look at them from the position hwaci is.  edit: for a more concrete answer : SQLite being public domains means nobody asks for shit from the SQLite team, there's zero string attached, even less than the GPL license , or even less than the BSD license. there's zero reason for a corporation using SQLite to pressure the team, because they can keep mooching out of the excellent work of the team without ever paying a dime if they don't feel inclined to.  full disclosure: a lot feel inclined to because SQLite professional support is laughably cheap, and you get access to answers from people that actually know what the fuck they're talking about. and when you're dealing with hundred million dollars business, you ain't fucking up your pasty few thousands dollars contract over twitter bullcrap. the adults are in the room now.  incidentally, if you're professionally using SQLite and are in a position to bully manglement into buying at least a perpetual license, please do. SQLite is basically the best fucking case we can get out of open software, and every dollar your random $bigcorp will send up their way **will** be used to make the software better, regardless of your, your manglement, and hipp's opinion.","label":0}

{"text":"The last four books released by Dinesh D'Souza explain what he refers to as 'The Big Lie.' The lie being that the Republicans have been historically and are currently racist\/fascist, that they switched sides during the Nixon administration, that racism was south vs. north problem (not a Democrat vs. Republican problem) and that Democrats are the party of tolerance and kindness. The evidence that he uses is  -The voting record of each party on the amendments mentioned in the meme (I do not believe that the numbers are correct, though the ultimate point is. Democrats, in general, were opposed to granting rights to blacks.) - The racist\/fascist history of the Democrat party (including voting against the amendments mentioned in the meme. Their support of the KKK (the militant arm of the democratic party). The passing of the Jim Crowe laws, and more.) - Democrat leaders fascination with fascist\/socialist leaders such as Hitler and Mussolini. - Democrat president's racist backgrounds (which includes FDR, Woodrow Wilson, and Andrew Jackson). - How the Democrat party used wellfare to tear apart the family unit of the black population and set up a new, nation-wide plantation for minorities. - How cities and states run by the Democrat party tend to mirror the living conditions of slaves back in the pre-Civil war era. - How no republican ever owned any slaves. All of these examples (plus many, many more) are used to back up the point OP is trying to make. If you are genuinely interested finding evidence for these claims, I would highly encourage you to look into Dinesh D'Souza. His books and YouTube videos do an amazing job at presenting this information.","label":0}

{"text":"You can call me stupid, arrogant, learning-impaired, or whatever; it still doesn't change that you don't understand the original story problem. \"For example, did 30% of women leaders lose a war\" does not mean women must have a 70% win percentage. It doesn't count women who have never led a country to war. It doesn't count numbers of wars lost; if one woman loses two wars, it only counts as one. It's possible that out of 100 female leaders, 30 went to war an average of 3 times each with no victories, for a 0-90 win\/loss record (all against men, of course). It's also possible that of 900 male leaders in the same time period, all 900 went to war exactly once. 405 (or 45%) lost a war to another male leader. 405 beat another man in a war, and 90 beat a woman, totalling 495 (or 55%).  I thought it through, and xenemorph's numbers add up. Your failure to understand the truth doesn't make it untrue.

As a side note, one of Allum's criticisms here is something that was kind of a world-changing realization for me when I first started doing it.  It turns out you *really can* just email the people directly and get all kinds of juicy info, or check facts, or tell them right to their face why you think they're wrong (politely, of course. Although... my emails tend to be incredibly longwinded with a shitload of links, so google sometimes labels me as a spambot). My first experience was with some of our Disrepectful Nod type operations, and random contacting of localization companies... and I've since emailed\/otherwise contacted YouTubers, professors, journalists, grad students, etc. etc.  They don't seem to even care if it's from my various anonymous accounts with \"itsnotmyfault\" signed at the bottom instead of my real name.   I think that's one of the biggest takeaways here, Sitch. A few weeks ago you seemed shocked that I got a response from an academic via email and I said basically \"yeah, people tend to respond to emails.\" Now you're hearing from a pro saying you're EXPECTED to send out these kinds of emails for this kind of work.   I'm also thinking about a Cernovich article I read where someone called him out for mass-emailing people in Washington looking for scoops, and he was like \"you're calling me out for doing journalism? You're retarded.\" Warning: 50% of the article is ads http:\/\/archive.is\/0TiIg, citing http:\/\/archive.is\/cHnNw  Edit: as a side note I didn't dig into this one and [got into an argument and uncritically repeated one of Sitch's talking points](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KotakuInAction\/comments\/9odpv9\/opinionethics_allum_bokharibreitbart_tech_in_the\/e7ub9zk\/?context=10000).

She is still proud of the fact that she choked out someone who was innocent.  Most of her twitter followers, and society is no different, think it's funny, she is a hero, and more of this should happen.  So if a drunk women grabs my ass in a bar, and I'm 100% certain it was her, and there are witnesses, according to this woman's logic, I should be able to grab her, and place her into a choke hold until she passes out?   Of course not!

People are subjects of their environment. When a negative environment exists, it's important to try to improve that environment. Keep in mind I'm a young adult as well. I make mistakes and I'm sure I have plenty of misguided opinions, but when something so backwards is celebrated this much across all races it surely has to be a concern.  I also don't believe whites as a race are seen as authority anymore. I think authority has become a much broader term now. Once I was pulled over by a black cop after I picked up my good friend from his home in Camden. He's Puerto Rican and he was also with his friend who was black, who is also a good friend of mine. I got off the exit and was immediately pulled over for \"going 45 in a 50\". I can't even make this shit up. The cop ID'd both of my friends and never asked for mine, even tho I was the driver. They had to step out of the car and get patted down while I watched. Obviously this is a pretty specific and unique situation, but I do think this happens more than we want to believe and the moral of the story is authority transcends race. People in power will abuse the power regardless of race, as this cop did. And it doesn't have to be that way, I just think that's typically the way it goes down.

"A second-round pick by GPE in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON spent parts of two seasons in the D-backs' system before they dealt him to PERSON in the November NUMBER PERSON trade. Things started to click for PERSON in NUMBER at Double-A, as the then NUMBER-year-old impressed with his feel to hit and power potential, but he was unable to build upon that success last year in Triple-A. He did, however, make his big league debut in GPE, logging one at-bat with the ORGANIZATION, who traded him to the Cardinals NUMBER days later in the PERSON deal. He opened NUMBER behind schedule as a result of a fractured right hand suffered while punching a television during the offseason. A lower body injury in May then sidelined him for nearly a month. PERSON has always intrigued scouts with his natural hitting ability and projectable power, but it hasn't come together for him as quickly as it seemed it might earlier in his career. He has an aggressive approach and good bat-to-ball skills from the left side of the plate, and there's plenty of raw power for him to tap into. Right now, though, PERSON makes way too much ground-ball contact -- he's posted ground-ball rates north of NUMBER percent in every pro season -- so a mechanical adjustment may be necessary to unlock his potential at the plate.The D-backs moved PERSON from shortstop, his high school position, to the outfield at the start of his career. He's become an average defender out there, spending most of his time in left, with average arm strength that enabled him to record NUMBER outfield assists in NUMBER.",1
"Originally signed by the ORGANIZATION out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON was dealt to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the NUMBER PERSON. He has developed a solid reputation as a hitter, producing good batting averages and low strikeout totals throughout his young career. PERSON has a quick, balanced swing and a good feel for the barrel, helping him hit line drives to all fields. So far that hasn't translated into much power, but scouts expect that part of his game to come as he physically matures. PERSON is a below-average runner, limiting him defensively. He is passable in left field, but his bat will have to continue to produce as he advances through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"GPE catchers are always in high demand, and short supply, come ORGANIZATION time. A left-handed hitting backstop who performs, no matter where, is bound to move up ORGANIZATION boards and that's exactly what was happening with PERSON as June approached.One of the best Division II talents in the country, PERSON can really swing the bat. He has plus bat speed from the left side of the plate with a good overall approach that should allow him to hit for average. He has plenty of power and could have even more as he learns to pull the ball more when needed. His overall catching is a work in progress, as he has limited agility, but many think he has the chance to stick behind the plate. He does have decent hands and good raw arm strength, though his exchange and footwork make his overall arm just average.Even if a team isn't sure PERSON can be a catcher long-term, there's a good chance one will buy the bat at some point in the early rounds.",0
"PERSON passed on signing with the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER and instead opted for his senior season at ORGANIZATION, where he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and NUMBER saves to finish with the second-most saves (NUMBER) in program history. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their third-round pick in June, and he proved to be far more than just a money-saving selection during his pro debut after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER below slot value.  PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON because he's a lanky, side-armed right-hander with two above-average pitches. His combination of a low NUMBERs fastball, that touches NUMBER mph, and a tight slider makes PERSON highly effective against same-sided hitters, and he's already impressed ORGANIZATION club officials with his ability to throw strikes from his unique slot.As a low-slot reliever who features both velocity and control, PERSON has the potential to jump on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER after reaching full-season ball during his pro debut.",0
"A talented two-way player from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON wanted to hit as a pro. Many teams liked him more as a pitcher, but the ORGANIZATION were more than willing to let him swing the bat. A slow starter in each of his first two full pro seasons, PERSON still mashed his way to Double-A at age NUMBER, collecting NUMBER or more home runs in each of those years. He capped off NUMBER with a strong ORGANIZATION, finishing first in slugging, second in home runs and third in OPS.There has never been any question about PERSON's raw power and earlier questions about his ability to tap into it consistently have thus far been answered. He's become a better overall hitter and is quicker to the ball than when he first entered pro ball. While he'll always rack up strikeouts, he did lower his K rate and improve his walk rate in NUMBER while moving up the ladder. PERSON also made huge strides in his defense at third and there are no longer concerns about his ability to stay at the hot corner, where his plus arm has always played well. He runs better than people might think at first glance, and some feel his athleticism would allow him to move to left field if there was a need or someone blocking him in GPE. For now, he'll continue to improve in all facets of the game as a third baseman, where he looks like he'll fit the power-hitting, run-producing profile in the mold of a ORGANIZATION type of player.",1
"On the ORGANIZATION and in the first half of his junior spring, PERSON looked like a solid third round prospect, a pitchability lefty sitting NUMBER-NUMBER mph with mostly average stuff, and above-average feel and command. In the month or so leading up to the draft, PERSON's velo ticked up, and down the stretch he sat NUMBER-NUMBER, touching NUMBER mph deep into starts, with an assortment of offspeed pitches that all flashed above-average. The track record of GPE arms is concerning, but PERSON seemed less beholden to the issues traditionally associated with their prospects, with some scouts considering him endearingly rebellious. 
He throws a cutter, slider, curveball, and changeup that all flash above-average, with the slider occasionally flashing plus. He was NUMBER-NUMBER this spring, so the velo uptick has held for nearly a year now. He's a potential No. NUMBER if this continues, maybe more if it's just the start of something.",0
"PERSON had a great draft year. He had a plus arm, above-average speed and defense, solid-average raw power, and performed on paper.  The concern was that his swing was a little stiff and had a grooved, invariable path, and it was thought that this might limit his offensive upside and relegate him to a fourth outfielder role. A year and change later, and that's largely still the report, with likely outcomes ranging from low-end everyday center fielder to NUMBER-man filler/emergency callup depending on how his offense progresses.",0
"Recruited by PERSON as a two-way player, PERSON saw little action as a pitcher or an infielder as a freshman in NUMBER. He did, however, experiment with dropping his arm slot, which improved the velocity and life on his fastball. The ORGANIZATION liked the results enough to draft him in the NUMBERth round out of ORGANIZATION (Fla.) JC in NUMBER and sign him away from an ORGANIZATION State commitment for $NUMBER,NUMBER.PERSON worked with a mid-NUMBERs fastball from a more conventional three-quarters arm angle. While most pitchers lose velocity when they throw from a lower slot, he saw his fastball jump to NUMBER-NUMBER mph and top out at NUMBER while at ORGANIZATION. In his third pro season, he was operating at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with quality sink that yields a lot of groundouts before sustaining a slight tear in his trapezius muscle in mid-May.Hitters have trouble squaring up PERSON's sinker when he keeps it down in the zone. He backs it up with a hard, sweeping slider that is quite effective against right-handers. He's having much more success against left-handers in NUMBER after they hit him hard in his first two years as a pro, and if he keeps that up, he could start to rise quickly through the Minors.",0
"The ORGANIZATION spent a franchise-record $NUMBER.NUMBER million on bonuses and penalties for their NUMBER-NUMBER international class, including $NUMBER million in a bonus and tax for PERSON and $NUMBER,NUMBER for PERSON. A ORGANIZATION, he didn't reach full-season ball until August NUMBER but jumped to Double-A NUMBER months later. Though he succeeded as a starter in NUMBER, his small frame led GPE to make him a full-time reliever in NUMBER.Now that he's working out of the bullpen, PERSON relies primarily on two pitches. He attacks hitters up in the strike zone with a four-seam fastball that sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches NUMBER, then drops in a low-NUMBERs curveball that shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. He didn't exhibit much feel for or trust in his changeup as a starter.PERSON creates deception by hiding the ball well and employing a high arm slot that gives him some downhill angle and helps him stay on top of his curveball. He has mostly pounded the strike zone since coming to the GPE in NUMBER, though his control wasn't as sharp after he first arrived in Double-A. He could develop into a seventh-inning reliever at the big league level.",0
"After two pedestrian seasons at ORGANIZATION, PERSON changed the course of his career by altering the grip on his cut fastball while watching video of PERSON. As a junior in NUMBER, he threw the first perfect game in GPE history, had a NUMBER-inning streak without allowing an earned run and set school records for strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) and opponent average (.NUMBER). He has breezed through pro ball since the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the second round, leading the system with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his first full season in NUMBER.PERSON relies heavily on his cut fastball, command and deception. His cutter sits in the upper NUMBERs with sharp lateral break that keeps it off barrels. He works from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with a four-seam fastball that's more effective than its velocity because he spots it on the edges of the strike zone. PERSON will flash some solid changeups and curveballs but they're mostly average offerings. He always has attacked hitters, even before he had his nasty cutter, and fits the profile of a durable back-of-the-rotation starter. He also could make for an interesting reliever who could lean more heavily on his out pitch.",0
"PERSON separated himself as the top high school middle infielder in the NUMBER Draft class, part of a rare breed as a prep shortstop who undoubtedly can stay at the premium position. The ORGANIZATION product has a plus arm and easy actions defensively. His pure speed is just average, but he's a heady runner who can steal a base. He uses a loose, wristy stroke to spray line drives to all fields and there should be some power to come as he matures. There were some questions about his hitting tool, but the Phillies are confident he'll hit enough to be an everyday shortstop at the big league level.",0
"Depending on when you see him, PERSON's nephew either looks like a special outfielder who could become as good as his uncle or just an ordinary young kid trying to find his way. There's no question GPE has a very high ceiling. He has very good raw tools, including the ability to hit for average and power, though the latter hasn't shown up in games consistently yet. GPE is an aggressive hitter, but like his uncle, he tends to make contact more than you think he should -- though some refinement would allow him to tap into that power more. GPE runs fairly well, and he has about as strong an outfield arm as you'll find in the ORGANIZATION. All of GPE's skills give him the potential to be the prototypical right fielder when all is said and done, but first he has to show he can use those considerable tools consistently on the field.",0
"GPE and tightly wound, PERSON was already a tenuous bet to stay at third base for very long before he twice ruptured his GPE tendon, once during a spring training game and again while rehabbing in late May. The NUMBER month timetable for return from GPE tears was reset, and puts PERSON on track to come back sometime in June. While there are questions about his defense, PERSON was one of the top college bats in the NUMBER class. He has quick, explosive hands that generate big bat speed, and he has unusual bat control for someone who swings as hard as he does. He has sizable ceiling, especially if he can find a way to stay at third base, but we just won't know what kind of toll the injuries have taken until PERSON starts playing games again. He's a good bet to see time in the NUMBER ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON performed well in his first two years at FACILITY as well as in the ORGANIZATION, putting him in position to go in the early rounds of the NUMBER Draft. Though his stuff regressed during his junior season, PERSON still liked his track record enough to sign him for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a fifth-rounder. He bounced back in his first full year in pro ball before struggling mightily in the upper levels of the Minors in NUMBER.Though he got rocked this year, PERSON has maintained his ability to throw four average-ish pitches for strikes. His best offering is his curveball, a plus bender with power and depth at times. His fastball usually ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER with some natural cutting action, and he also throws a true cutter and a changeup that must improve to help him against left-handers.PERSON has some funkiness in his delivery that adds to his deception without hampering his control. Despite his rough season, the ORGANIZATION still think he has a chance to become a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter. If that doesn't happen, his curveball could help him find success as a reliever.",0
"Gonsalves was an intriguing, albeit a bit inconsistent, PERSON prospect from the LOCATION high school ranks back in NUMBER and the ORGANIZATION saw enough in the southpaw to go above pick value to sign him away from his GPE commitment in the fourth round. Since then, the only thing that's slowed him from developing into one of the better lefty prospects in the game was a minor shoulder issue that delayed the start to his NUMBER season in Double-A, though he still pitched well enough to reach Triple-A for the first time.The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER southpaw uses a combination of pitchability and deception that allows his largely solid-average stuff to play up and miss bats consistently. He'll largely pitch with his fastball in the low NUMBERs, with the ability to reach for an extra tick or two on occasion, thrown with good riding life. His changeup remains his best secondary pitch, one he throws with good sink and effectively keeps down in the zone. His curve should give him a third Major League average offering when all is said and done.Gonsalves did a much better job of commanding the baseball in NUMBER and improved control of all his pitches should allow him to have continued success at the upper levels of the system. He has the ceiling of a solid mid-rotation starter.",1
"The ORGANIZATION' pursuit of PERSON during the NUMBER-NUMBER international period led the club to acquire additional international pool money, which they then used to sign the then-NUMBER-year-old for $NUMBER,NUMBER in January NUMBER. His rawness showed during in his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, but he made strides in his second tour of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER and then followed it up with a strong performance in instructional league. PERSON continued to move up the ladder and was pitching well in the GPE League when the ORGANIZATION dealt him to GPE for PERSON Jr. ahead of the NUMBER PERSON Deadline.PERSON saw an uptick in velocity in NUMBER as he continued to get stronger and grow into his projectable frame. He showed the ability to bump NUMBER mph with his fastball as an amateur, but was hitting NUMBER-NUMBER mph at times during the regular season and instructs. His slider and changeup are below-average pitches for him, though both should improve as he gains better feel for pitching.Learning how to repeat his delivery will be key for PERSON, who struggles to keep his body and lightning-quick arm in sync. The right-hander's arm strength offers plenty to dream on, but he'll have to check countless developmental boxes before being deemed ready for the big leagues.",0
"GPE closers are often quick-to-the-big leagues relievers, but not ninth-inning guys once they get there. GPE has the chance to be a Major League closer, a reason some thought he could go in the first round, so the Twins were likely happy the hard-throwing right-hander was still available in the second round.At PERSON, GPE consistently hit triple digits and sat in the upper-NUMBERs consistently. The heater has good movement and he couples it with a nasty slider that touches the low-NUMBERs. He does have a changeup, but don't expect to see it much in his pro career, as his two-pitch power are more than enough to get outs.There is some effort to GPE's delivery and he's never going to have outstanding command, but he has everything a team wants to see in a pitcher to close out games.",0
"First Presbyterian Day School (ORGANIZATION, Ga.) already has sent one left-hander to the big leagues in PERSON, has another nearly there with the Royals in PERSON and a possible third in GPE. PERSON's best pitching prospect since PERSON was a ORGANIZATION fourth-rounder in NUMBER, he finished the regular season with a strikeout rate of NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings. The only ORGANIZATION Division I southpaw with a better whiff rate was GPE's PERSON, a lock first-rounder.GPE missed bats at a similar clip as a sophomore, thanks to a fastball and curveball that both grade as plus pitches at their best. He sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball and can pump it up to NUMBER with some run and sink. He has both power and depth to his curveball, which has true NUMBER-to-NUMBER break at ORGANIZATION has two more decent if less reliable pitches in his slider and changeup. He has a strong frame built for durability, good athleticism and no glaring flaws in his delivery. To reach his potential as a starter, he'll need to curb his tendency to nibble at the plate and challenge hitters more often.",0
"PERSON had the reputation of being one of the most advanced high school position players in recent years, having played for six GPE national teams before signing for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as the sixth overall pick in the NUMBER Draft. He didn't quite progress as fast as expected, though he did make his big league debut in NUMBER and scored the go-ahead run in the NUMBERth inning of Game Seven of the World Series.PERSON's defense has been as good as advertised. Though he has just average speed, his keen instincts, quick jumps and precise routes allow him to track down most balls in center field. He also has a strong, accurate arm that keeps baserunners in check.At the plate, PERSON excels at making contact but has yet to demonstrate that he can contribute much beyond hitting for average. He has yet to tap into his average raw power, rarely walks and won't steal many bases. His ceiling is probably a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER homers per year, and he'll have to develop more patience to reach it.",1
"After the FACILITY charged PERSON with rebuilding their international program following a bonus-skimming scandal, his first six-figure signing was PERSON for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE in December NUMBER. He hurt his elbow shortly after turning pro and had PERSON surgery that delayed his pro debut until NUMBER. He led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION in NUMBER but sliced his ERA from NUMBER.NUMBER to NUMBER.NUMBER and finished third with NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER innings when he returned there last year.As a tall, lanky right-hander with a loose arm, PERSON elicited comparisons to former All-Star PERSON (no relation) when he signed. His low-NUMBERs fastball tops out at NUMBER mph, with the sink and angle on his heater creating swings and misses as well as groundouts. While his secondary pitches lack consistency, his slider displays some bite and he improved the arm speed on his fading changeup last yearPERSON still is learning to repeat his delivery and command his pitches. He did a better job in the second half of NUMBER, when he recorded a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA and limited opponents to a .NUMBER average in his final NUMBER starts. If he can build on that progress, he could factor into the back of GPE's rotation in a couple of years.",0
"PERSON jumped on scouts' radars during NUMBER Cape Cod League and then followed it with an even better junior season at ORGANIZATION, leading to his selection in the fourth round of the NUMBER Draft by the FACILITY. Despite pitching well in his professional debut -- half of which he spent in the full-season LOCATION League -- the FACILITY traded PERSON and right-hander J.B. Wendelken to GPE in December for PERSON Lawrie.PERSON has the makings of three average-or-better pitches, each of which plays up due to his advanced command. His NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame and long arms help him create an angle to the plate and also lend to his deception, allowing him to sneak up on opposing hitters with his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball. The left-hander's ability to command his heater throughout the zone helps set up his curveball and split-changeup, with both offerings showing above-average potential. While some scouts view PERSON as a future No. NUMBER starter, others believe he could jump on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION with a move to the bullpen given his command, ground-ball tendencies and solid track record against both right- and left-handed hitters.",0
"PERSON dropped baseball after his sophomore season in NUMBER, and PERSON didn't get drafted until after his senior season at ORGANIZATION. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER, he has to prove himself at every level and has done exactly that. He won the ORGANIZATION MVP award in NUMBER and made his big league debut in September.PERSON's best attribute is his plus raw power, which translates into at least average game pop. Most of his home runs come to his pull side. He doesn't strike out excessively and should hit for a decent average, though he also doesn't walk very much either.PERSON's lack of speed and athleticism limit his value beyond his bat. He does have the solid arm strength required for third base but doesn't cover much ground at the hot corner. He also has seen action at first base and is an adequate defender there.",0
"While it's still very early in his career, PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER, looks like one of the gems from his year's international class. Making his stateside debut in NUMBER, the then-NUMBER-year-old batted a robust .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER extra-base hits in NUMBER games across two Rookie levels, including an impressive NUMBER-game showing in the GPE League to finish the season. That progress continued for PERSON in NUMBER, with the outfielder earning All-Star honors with PERSON after he bypassed the ORGANIZATION level. PERSON may be loaded with tools, but he stands out most for his offensive ceiling. He has a fluid swing with an innate ability to impact the baseball from the left side of the plate, all the while demonstrating an advanced approach and power potential at a young age. He's an above-average runner who is still learning to effectively use his speed on the basepaths and in center field, where PERSON projects as at least an above-average defender.Though he profiles more as a top-of-the-order type right now, PERSON has the offensive tools to develop into a big-time run creator in the middle of a lineup.",0
"PERSON came to GPE from GPE in last summer's J.D. PERSON trade. He's a thick-legged multi-positional infielder who makes lots of hard, line-drive contact with a pretty funky swing. There are questions about his conditioning and ultimate defensive home. He's going to hit and have doubles power, projecting as a low-end regular or premium bench/utility option.",0
"A native of GPE, GPE, the same small hometown that produced former big league catcher and ex-Reds manager PERSON, ORGANIZATION did not get big bonus money when he was taken in the NUMBERth round out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE in NUMBER. He's always had power stuff with the ability to command it, but it wasn't until NUMBER that he started to figure things out.Everything ORGANIZATION throws is hard. His fastball touches triple-digits with ease and he mixes in an NUMBER-NUMBER mph slider and a low-NUMBERs changeup. In NUMBER, he continued to fill up the strike zone even with the uptick in velocity gained thanks to a strong conditioning effort, and he missed more bats while continuing to get a lot of groundball outs as well. He has drawn praise for his strong makeup and an ability to grind through adversity on the mound.ORGANIZATION wasn't on anyone's radars prior to NUMBER, but after his All-Star turn in the ORGANIZATION State League, he repeated his success in NUMBER, making the LOCATION All-Star team and earning a bump up to Triple-A. He should get the chance to see what he can do in GPE soon.",1
"PERSON signed for a lot of money ($NUMBER.NUMBER million) and amid a lot of controversy in February NUMBER. He presented a different birthdate than he had previously, a move that some clubs believed was designed to free him from the international bonus restrictions arising from the new Collective Bargaining Agreement. MLB eventually decided that it couldn't determine his birthdate, allowing the ORGANIZATION to keep him but also suspending him until July NUMBER.PERSON has barely played as a pro, breaking the hamate bone in his left hand NUMBER games into his debut last summer. He'll need plenty of polish and time to develop, but he also possesses the two tools every team looks for in a right fielder. He has above-average power, thanks to his bat speed and the leverage in his swing, and a cannon for an arm.PERSON will need to make some adjustments at the plate, where his long swing and pull-happy approach hamper his abilty to make consistent contact. He runs well for a big man and should be at least an average defender.",0
"The LOCATION pitcher of the year in NUMBER, PERSON dominated all spring for ORGANIZATION State with a fastball that reached NUMBER mph and a wipeout slider. Signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as the NUMBERth overall pick that June, he had his pro debut end abruptly when a batting-practice line drive struck him in the head and left him with a concussion. His stuff has diminished as he has risen through the ORGANIZATION, though he did make his big league debut in GSP's fastball now sits around NUMBER-NUMBER mph and tops out at NUMBER with decent life. His slider is less sharp and only shows flashes of the plus pitch it once was. His curveball and changeup are fringy offerings, and some scouts think he'd be more valuable as a two-pitch reliever.The ORGANIZATION have no immediate plans to change PERSON's role, even if he came out of the bullpen during his initial trial in the Majors and his ceiling now appears to be a back-of-the-rotation starter. He has a clean delivery and a track record of durability, but he'll need to improve his control and command before he faces big leaguers.",0
"Pitchers who drop their arm slots to more of a sidearm delivery typically don't throw harder upon making that mechanical shift. But that's exactly what's happened with GPE, who struggled to get mound time at FACILITY as a ""traditional"" pitcher, then dropped down and found some success after transferring to PERSON, a junior college in GPE. The ORGANIZATION took note and took him in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft. He shook off a slow start to his career and an injury in NUMBER to pitch well enough in the GPE League and the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER to earn a spot on the NUMBER-man roster.GPE continues to throw harder as he progresses through the ORGANIZATION system, thanks to his throwing program and tweaks he's made to his delivery. He's now NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball, routinely hitting triple digits during his ORGANIZATION stint, coming from a very low three-quarters to sidearm slot. At times, there's some serious sink that elicits a ton of groundball outs. He's already a very uncomfortable at-bat for any right-handed hitter and he's working on tightening up his slider to be a better all-around reliever. With his delivery and arm slot, it's tough for GPE to remain consistent in his mechanics, leading to some issues with command. He focused on that during his ORGANIZATION stint and the ORGANIZATION think it will continue to improve with more reps, with the chance for GPE to be a back-end bullpen guy in the big leagues.",0
"GPE was used mostly as a reliever in his first two years at ORGANIZATION, but he broke out as a starter on Cape Cod in the summer of NUMBER and returned to school as the ORGANIZATION ace. He threw the first nine-inning no-hitter in school history in March and his mix of stuff and pitchability intrigued scouts. GPE attacks hitters with a sinker-slider combination. He throws his fastball in the low-NUMBERs and uses his height to create a downhill plane. GPE also throws a solid changeup. Some scouts think his delivery is too stiff and that he profiles better in the bullpen. But the ORGANIZATION want to keep him in the rotation and GPE has all the tools necessary to be a No. NUMBER starter in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON pitched to mixed results as a swingman during his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION and didn't fare much better as a junior in NUMBER after a move to the bullpen. His raw stuff continued to improve throughout his college career, though, and the ORGANIZATION took notice, eventually selecting PERSON in the NUMBERth round that June. He struggled as a starter early in his pro career surrounding PERSON surgery in NUMBER, but moved to the bullpen in NUMBER and promptly took off in the new role, turning in a strong first half with PERSON, then posting a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA over NUMBER appearances after a July promotion to Double-A. After the season, the ORGANIZATION added PERSON to their NUMBER-man roster. A big and physical right-hander, PERSON will show two plus pitches in any given outing. He reaches NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his heater and throws it with late life that makes it difficult to lift for hitters on both sides of the plate. His breaking ball is equally dynamic, thrown in the upper NUMBERs with sharp, downer action that helps him miss bats with ease. Pitching at two levels in NUMBER, PERSON averaged NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts-per-nine, with a NUMBER percent swinging strike rate. PERSON's ability to induce whiffs with both pitches makes his below-average control (NUMBER.NUMBER walks-per-nine in 'NUMBER) a lesser issue, though there is some concern over whether hitters will continue to chase his stuff outside of the zone at higher levels. Given the ORGANIZATION' history of aggressively pushing their best relief prospects, PERSON could soon find himself in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION nabbed PERSON in the fourth round of the NUMBER Draft, they were getting a college bat with power and a good approach, one who finished tied for second in home runs among Division I hitters and who led the nation in GPE. That wasn't the player who showed up for his pro debut, but the ORGANIZATION are hopeful that will be the exception and not the norm.In college, PERSON thrived with terrific plate discipline, drawing more walks than strikeouts in his career. During his pro debut, his walk rate was below average and he never really got his bat going. The ORGANIZATION product has plus raw power, and a return to his refined approach should allow him to do what he did in college. PERSON's defense is a bigger question mark. He's fringy, at best, at the hot corner, with a below-average arm. PERSON has a ways to go on that front, and a move to first, where he played during his junior season, isn't out of the question.It was the bat the ORGANIZATION were buying when they selected PERSON. If he can fulfill his potential on that front, his power and run-production potential should profile well wherever he plays defensively.",0
"There's raw power and there's in-game power. Many a prospect over time has the former, but never can find a way to tap into it to have the latter consistently. While there is a lot of swing and miss to GPE's game, he's shown that he can hit the ball out, with NUMBER homers over his first two full years of pro ball. It's that power the ORGANIZATION wanted when they acquired him last fall from the D-backs in return for catcher PERSON Herrmann.GPE's power comes more from strength than bat speed and he's always going to strike out a lot. While he'll draw some walks, he'll never hit for a high average. He played both the outfield and first base in the D-backs system and the ORGANIZATION plan to let him play mostly in the outfield moving forward, though they won't abandon first base entirely. He'll mostly play the corners, but might see some time in center as well. GPE runs well for someone his size, stealing NUMBER bases in NUMBER.The upper levels should be a good challenge for GPE to see if the power will keep showing up against better pitching. If it keeps coming, his left-handed power bat could be of value, at least off of a big league bench.",0
"The combination of pitching in GPE and a less-than-orthodox delivery made it a little tough for some teams to evaluate PERSON, but the ORGANIZATION liked what they saw enough to make him the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick in the NUMBER GPE.The GPEan high school product definitely has good stuff and throws virtually nothing straight. His fastball can reach as high as NUMBER mph, but will more likely sit in the low-NUMBERs, and it has a ton of run and sink. PERSON had one of the best breaking balls of any high schooler in his GPE class, a nasty slider with so much lateral break it was tough for prep backstops to catch. His changeup also has good sink and he should be an effective groundball pitcher. A funky low arm slot adds to his deception and helps him miss bats.That delivery, along with a relative lack of size, does concern some in terms of his ability to start long-term. But his overall athleticism and surprising strength should allow him to quiet doubters in time.",0
"This is another reliever who, based on usage patterns, it appears is being developed for some kind of muti-inning role, perhaps to follow the opener. PERSON was acquired from GPE for PERSON, and after the ORGANIZATION had taken his early-career development slowly (PERSON was a raw college arm from GPE), the ORGANIZATION hit the gas pedal and quickly moved him to GPE in May. He thrived there, typically throwing NUMBER to NUMBER pitches once every three to five days. Most of those pitches are mid-NUMBERs fastballs that play up due to big extension, while some are above-average sliders. 
On paper, this reads like a standard two-pitch middle reliever, and for that reason, it's fair to question whether PERSON's usage might be caricaturing his velocity, and if his fastball would be this hard on back-to-back days, or if his usage would be more variable. But if this is just how PERSON is going to use him, then this is the stuff. PERSON threw NUMBER innings in NUMBER games. His four starts were some of his shortest outings. It's possible PERSON's usage has been for developmental reasons, but we tend to think he was being prepared for a fairly distinctive role before elbow trouble sidelined him for much of NUMBER, before he was ultimately traded as a PTBNL in the ORGANIZATION deal..",0
"Heading into the NUMBER season, the belief was that PERSON would use his frontline rotation stuff and separate himself from the rest of the class, making him the slam-dunk choice for being taken NUMBER-NUMBER. PERSON, which has plagued him for much of his career at GPE, not to mention some time on the shelf with back spasms, made PERSON more of a wild card than hoped. He ultimately fell to the A's with the seventh overall pick and signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER, the recommended value for the slot.Big and strong, PERSON arguably has the best raw stuff of any arm in the NUMBER class, with the chance to have three plus pitches. He's capable of touching NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball regularly. Ironically, he might have been at his best in the one inning he threw before his back acted up, showing a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball and a plus slider at NUMBER-NUMBER mph. He can maintain his velocity deep into starts and while his changeup is his third pitch, it should be PERSON average in the future.PERSON's biggest stumbling block has been his control and command, something that kept him from dominating college competition consistently during his Gators career. But that should improve with his ongoing development, giving PERSON the chance to become a rotation stalwart in the big leagues for years to come.",0
"The son of five-time All-Star and World Series hero PERSON, PERSON got drafted two rounds earlier than his dad did out of GPE in NUMBER when the ORGANIZATION made him a second-rounder in June. Part of a Chaparral High (ORGANIZATION, Ariz.) program that produced big league sluggers PERSON and PERSON, he spurned a commitment to PERSON to sign for $NUMBER,NUMBER. He made an immediate impression in pro ball, collecting NUMBER hits (five for extra bases) in his first five games.Gonzalez offered some of the best right-handed raw power among prepsters in the NUMBER Draft. He's strong and his size gives him good leverage. He showed a more mature approach as a high school senior than he had in the past, recognizing and taking more pitches while doing a better job of using the entire field.Gonzalez has a chance to hit for average and power, and most of his value will come from his bat. While he has good hands at third base, he's a below-average runner with modest arm strength. It remains to be seen whether he'll stick at the hot corner or have to move to first base or left field.",0
"GPE has become adept at developing pitchers with exceptional control. The ORGANIZATION' prized pupil is PERSON, who had the lowest walk rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER and was named the LOCATION League Pitcher of the Year.PERSON's fastball isn't overpowering, but he has increased its velocity every year of his career, and it now sits in the low-NUMBERs and reaches NUMBER mph. His changeup is his best secondary offering, though his slider shows the potential to become a solid pitch with a little more development. PERSON's impeccable control allows all of his pitches to play up.PERSON's stuff isn't the biggest in the system, but he has the tools to be a solid big league starter in time. He reminds some ORGANIZATION officials of PERSON.",0
"PERSON was nearly anonymous as a prospect until NUMBER. He played at a high profile Atlanta-area high school (the same one as his brother PERSON, who the ORGANIZATION drafted in first round in NUMBER), played sparingly for a year at ORGANIZATION, then transferred to GPE PERSON's River junior college in GPE, ORGANIZATION, where he hit NUMBER homers, a feat that got him to ORGANIZATION for his junior season. He had a solid season for the Bulldogs but was a first base-only prospect with no pedigree who hit five home runs, so you can see why he lasted until the NUMBERth round in the NUMBER draft.  His hitability translated well that first pro summer and in NUMBER, which he split across both A-Ball levels at ages NUMBER and NUMBER. The missing element here is that while PERSON had plus raw power the first time we saw him at ORGANIZATION, he didn't have the kind of swing or approach to get the most out of it. This untapped tool and his plate discipline are the reasons he was a NUMBERth rounder and not a NUMBERth rounder who went back to school for his senior year. In NUMBER, PERSON did a rare thing: he tried to do more damage at the plate and lift the ball a bit more, but was able to keep his contact rates the same while adding game power. PERSON did this in the ORGANIZATION farm system two years in a row and went from an untapped, toolsy prospect who was passed over in the Rule NUMBER Draft to a Rookie of the Year runner-up; PERSON went from the top of the 'Others of PERSON' section last year to one of the top NUMBER prospects in the game over a NUMBER month period. PERSON is a fine defender at first but the value here is all in the bat. Because he's left-handed, the downside is a platoon option at NUMBERB/DH, though the ORGANIZATION cycle through those types very quickly. Underlying indicators and ORGANIZATION data suggest PERSON's very loud NUMBER stats aren't fluky and he may just be a NUMBER bat with advanced feel for the zone and NUMBER game power, which is a solid regular. He might be big league ready in the middle of NUMBER.",0
"PERSON made waves in NUMBER, his first full professional season. But his follow-up campaign was brought to an abrupt halt by a collision in the second game of the season that forced him to undergo PERSON surgery and a procedure to repair a microfracture in his wrist. He had a rough return in NUMBER as he advanced to Double-A Harrisburg, and went unprotected and unpicked in the Rule NUMBER Draft. PERSON had a strong track record of hitting before his injury. He generates big raw power, controls the strike zone well and knows how to work a walk. A lot of swing-and-miss comes along with that approach, and he ends up being an all-or-nothing hitter at ORGANIZATION has played both first and third base as a pro and is a below-average defender at both spots. He has enough power to profile at either corner, but will have to show enough of a feel for pitching to consistently tap into it.",0
"Signed out of GPE for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER, PERSON didn't reach full-season ball until his fifth pro season and got shelled for a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA when he finally got to low Class A. He turned himself into a prospect last season, when he led high Class A GPE League relievers in opponent average (.NUMBER), strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) and holds (NUMBER). He also finished third in saves (NUMBER) despite not closing games before July.PERSON's live NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball can reach triple digits and seems to get on hitters even quicker because of deception in his delivery. He backs up his heat with an improving slider that arrives in the mid-NUMBERs with late bite. He also can cross up hitters by mixing in a changeup every once in a while.PERSON expends effort in his delivery, which costs him some control and command. If he can throw more strikes and refine his slider into a plus pitch, he could develop into a closer at the big league level. He'll also need to watch his weight because he carries much more than the listed NUMBER pounds on his NUMBER-foot frame.",1
"PERSON was viewed as a better position prospect than a pitcher as a high school senior even though he could pump a mid-NUMBERs fastball. He passed on signing with the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER and honored his commitment to GPE, where he would struggle at the plate and make just one appearance on the mound before leaving the team in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the NUMBERth round that June, signing him for $NUMBER,NUMBER, then dealt him to the ORGANIZATION a little over a year later in exchange for PERSON. He excelled with PERSON early in the NUMBER season, earning PERSON All-Star honors along with a promotion to Double-A, where he opened his NUMBER campaign. PERSON shows power stuff out of the bullpen. He'll sit at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touch NUMBER with a riding fastball that he pairs with a low-to-mid-NUMBERs slider that has a high spin rate and earns above-average grades from scouts. He also has a changeup, but it's a distant third pitch that he seldom throws. After issuing NUMBER.NUMBER walks-per-nine in his first full season, PERSON made strides with both his control and command in NUMBER before taking a slight step back in 'NUMBER. The gains PERSON made with his breaking ball and overall feel for pitching last season bode well for his chances of reaching the ORGANIZATION as middle reliever capable of working multiple frames.",0
"A potential top-five-rounds pick after leading PERSON to the ORGANIZATION NUMBERA state championship in NUMBER, PERSON instead fell to the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBERth round because of his commitment to ORGANIZATION. His decision to attend college paid off handsomely, as he went No. NUMBER overall in the NUMBER GPE and received the largest up-front bonus ($NUMBER.NUMBER million) for a position player in GPE history. PERSON improved offensively and defensively throughout his time with the ORGANIZATION, blossoming into the ORGANIZATION of the Year and PERSON of the Year as a junior.With his bat speed, strength and leverage, PERSON generates power to all fields from the right side of the plate. He improved as a hitter as he has understood that he doesn't have to sell out for home runs. PERSON made tremendous strides with his plate discipline during the spring, and he has the swing and feel for hitting to produce solid batting averages.While there were questions about PERSON's defensive ability when he arrived at ORGANIZATION, that's not the case any longer. He has cleaned up his receiving and there's no doubt that he can stay at catcher, where his strong arm deters the running game. PERSON is relatively athletic for his position, though he's not a factor on the bases.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks. His development has been stalled by injuries since, however, as a broken bone in his left hand -- suffered on a hitter's follow-through -- derailed his first full season, and a broken hamate in his left hand sidelined him for nearly two months in NUMBER. PERSON made up for some of that lost time with a strong performance in the ORGANIZATION, and he's impressed club officials with his progress this season while reaching Double-A in his first fully healthy campaign. A right-handed hitter, PERSON shows solid power potential thanks to a combination of bat speed and physical strength. He makes a lot of contact and has a good feel for the strike zone, making PERSON difficult to strike out, and he doesn't shy away from taking a walk. He's made impressive strides in his blocking and receiving since signing, all the while continuing to work on his framing and catch-and-throw skills.Developing high school catchers tends to take time, and that's certainly been the case with the oft-injured PERSON. His solid tools on both sides of the ball, as well as his capacity to make adjustments, portends to a career as at least a big league backup.",1
"The electric nature of GPE's stuff makes him likely to play some kind of significant big league role even if he fails to develop starter's command. He sits NUMBER-NUMBER and touches NUMBER with his fastball whlie also showing an occasionally plus breaking ball and plus-plus changeup. He's an excellent candidate for multi-inning relief at least, and could be much more if his command develops.",0
"GPE and projectable when he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a ORGANIZATION high schooler in the ninth round of the NUMBER Draft, PERSON needed time to adapt to pro ball. He led the Minors with NUMBER losses in NUMBER but his stuff kicked up a notch even while he was going NUMBER-NUMBER in the second half. He moved up a level in NUMBER and was part of the three-team deal that sent him and PERSON, among others, to GPE in return for PERSON, PERSON and others.After working in the low NUMBERs and topping out at NUMBER mph with his fastball, PERSON began dealing in the mid-NUMBERs and threatening triple digits. His heater has late life, too. He's still developing consistency with his secondary pitches, though his slider can reach the mid-NUMBERs with nice bit at times. PERSON doesn't display as much feel for his offspeed pitches. He's a good athlete but his delivery can get stiff and his control suffers as a result. Though he still has a long way to go to make it as a starter, the progress he made at the end of last year is encouraging.",0
"GPE is attempting to follow in the footsteps of PERSON and PERSON, as left-handers to go from pitching for the ORGANIZATION of GPE to appearing in the All-Star Game. After a solid first full professional season in the hitter friendly GPE, the NUMBER second-rounder was included by the ORGANIZATION in their package they sent to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON. His first full season with his new organization has been a little up-and-down.GPE primarily relies on his fastball-slider combination. His fastball typically sat around NUMBER mph during his debut, but he's shown more velocity in the past and may be able to recapture it. His slider is his best pitch, and he can drop it in on the hands of left-handers or on the back foot of right-handers. His changeup has been a work in progress.There had been uncertainly whether PERSON could remain a starter like PERSON or follow PERSON' path to the bullpen. After NUMBER starters in Double-A in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION started using the southpaw in relief and he seemed comfortable in the role.",0
"It's never a bad thing to try and target up-the-middle athletes in the GPE. For the past two years, the ORGANIZATION have gone that route early, taking PERSON in NUMBER then taking PERSON a year later, also in the second round. A back issue found in his physical delayed his signing and the ORGANIZATION erred on the side of caution and held him out of play last summer.PERSON didn't play in games during instructional league games in GPE last fall, but he did finally see some action in their GPE instructs program after that and he is ready to hit the ground running in NUMBER. PERSON has bat speed and strength, with the chance to eventually be an above-average hitter with solid average power from the left side of the plate. PERSON runs well and has a strong arm that would work well in right field, though the ORGANIZATION believe he could stay in center long term because of his athleticism. He has the kind of build and athleticism that reminds some of a ORGANIZATION type player.PERSON needs reps and to get on the field so he can start sharpening his raw tools and reach his considerable ceiling. If it all clicks, he has a chance to be a five-tool player manning an outfield spot in the big leagues on a daily basis.",0
"PERSON was thought to be the best high school hitter in the NUMBER Draft class, if not the top bat overall, and was in conversations for the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. The ORGANIZATION got him at ORGANIZATION. NUMBER and quickliy moved the high school catcher to the outfield, thinking his bat would carry him up the ladder quickly. Instead, he made very little progress -- he did show a little more pop in his bat in NUMBER -- and PERSON sent him to the ORGANIZATION in return for pitchers PERSON and PERSON last ORGANIZATIONvember.The first thing the ORGANIZATION did was move PERSON back behind the plate, thinking he could have more value there than in an outfield corner. PERSON embraced the move back behind the plate with open arms and made early improvements with his hands and mobility, and he's always had a strong arm. There is less pressure to produce offensively compared to an outfield corner, and that could help PERSON relax at the plate, where he's been slow to make adjustments.PERSON eased into full-time catching by splitting time between being behind the plate and DHing. It looks like a new home and new position is helping him wipe the slate clean and start over again.",0
"GPE seniors, particularly those taken in the NUMBERth round of a GPE, tend to have to prove themselves every step of the way. After a very impressive year-plus in the ORGANIZATION organization since coming out of GPE, GPE might be ready to start skipping some of those steps.GPE fits in the category of a player whose whole is greater than the sum of his parts. He won't wow with any plus tools, but can do a little of everything fairly well. He barrels balls up well at the plate and with an advanced approach at the plate, should continue to hit for average. He has some extra-base pop and it would surprise few if he found a way to hit at least NUMBER homers annually in the future. He's an average runner, but he has the instincts to steal a few bases. A center fielder in college, he plays a solid right field now with an average, but accurate arm.After his fine first full season, all spent in the ORGANIZATION, GPE more than held his own in the ORGANIZATION. He could be ready to jump on a faster developmental track.",0
"The younger brother of former GPE first-rounder PERSON, PERSON spent three years as part of ORGANIZATION's infield, parlaying his best offensive year as a junior into a fifth-round selection in the NUMBER Draft. He promptly set the short-season LOCATION on fire, winning ORGANIZATION honors and the batting title in the process.Jackson didn't hit much until his final season at ORGANIZATION, when he topped .NUMBER for the first time. There's no power to speak of, but he did show a solid approach at the plate during his pro debut, with an ability to make consistent contact and get on base. His NUMBER stolen bases not only led the LOCATION, but ranked second in the ORGANIZATION organization despite him playing just NUMBER games and not having blinding speed. He is, however extremely athletic and that helps him on both sides of the ball. His best defensive tool by far, though, is his arm, a pure cannon that could help him stay at ORGANIZATION appeared to fit the profile of a future utility infielder when he was drafted. If he can prove his debut wasn't a mirage, the ORGANIZATION just might have gotten more than they expected.",0
"It didn't make nearly as many headlines as the ORGANIZATION Chapman and PERSON trades, but the deal that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION last November netted the ORGANIZATION a potential starting pitcher in GPE. Extremely young (age NUMBER) and projectable when he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft, he lowered his ORGANIZATION at each of his five stops in the GPE system. He went NUMBER-NUMBER with a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings between two Class A teams last year. He had earned a promotion up to Double-A in NUMBER and was pitching well there when he was sent to the Twins in a Deadline deal for PERSON has improved his conditionining and his stuff, working at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with a fastball that plays up thanks to its rising life and his command. His best offering is often his curveball, which has depth and can be a plus pitch at times. His changeup has its moments as well and helps him keep left-handers in check.GPE's pitchability may be more impressive than his stuff. He can't overpower hitters but he mixes his pitches, pounds the strike zone and keeps the ball down, generating plenty of strikeouts and groundouts. He has a ceiling of a No. NUMBER starter, perhaps more if he can add more power to his pitches.",1
"GPE is the typical quick-twitch GPE outfielder that lands in the highest bonuses each year. He has a big, present plus arm that could get even better with maturity. He's also an above average runner that projects for above average power and flashes above average bat speed. The questions about him revolve around his feel to hit in games, which then impacts the power he can show in games, and if he'll gain or lose a step as he matures, which would dictate a center field or right field fit.",0
"After coming to the ORGANIZATION from the ORGANIZATION as part of that big NUMBER-player trade in July NUMBER, PERSON pitched very well, even though the ORGANIZATION moved him up a level to Double-A. He's a big, durable right-hander with some pitches that have the chance to be above-average or better. Aggressive on the mound, he goes right after hitters with his fastball that tops out at NUMBER mph. He's throwing a curve more frequently, and it's a Major League average offering. His changeup, once a distant third, has improved to the point where it has the chance to be above average. He throws strikes and while some used to wonder if he'd end up in the bullpen, he's looking more and more like a workhorse-like starter.",0
Bies was a NUMBERth rounder in NUMBER that had solid average stuff but huge size and good feel. He's having a loud full-season debut and could be a useful utility arm.,0
"In some ways, PERSON is a college arm stuck in a high schooler's body. He has a really advanced feel for a prepster. He has a three-pitch mix that won't wow you in terms of pure stuff, but it's solid average across the board. Both his changeup and perhaps even his curve have the chance to be better than average in the future. His fastball has a lot of sink and will sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. He has very good command, showing the ability to locate and move the ball around the zone. While he will be just NUMBER for all of the NUMBER season, his pitchability may allow him to move a little faster than many high school draftees.",0
"Â PERSON was lightly scouted as a lankly and soft-tossing left-hander, but the ORGANIZATION took a flier on the local high school product in the NUMBERth round. Since then, PERSON has made significant strides, and he was one of the key pieces PERSON acquired in exchange for PERSON at the NUMBER PERSON Deadline.PERSON's velocity has improved significantly since he signed. His fastball now sits around NUMBER mph, and it has reached as high as NUMBER mph. While PERSON's already gotten stronger since signing, there's even more projection left in his frame. His body type and his low three-quarters arm slot lead to comparisons to PERSON Sale.Even with all of his advances so far, PERSON still has plenty of room for growth. His secondary pitches have good potential, but they are inconsistent. PERSON needs to refine his command. He started making those adjustments in NUMBER at ORGANIZATION A Lancaster, where he has thrived despite pitching in one of the most hitter friendly parks in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON spent his first pro season in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION and returned there to start NUMBER before coming to the GPE and breaking out. He tied for the Rookie-level PERSON lead with six triples in just NUMBER games and before tying for fourth in the short-season LOCATION with eight homers in just NUMBER contests. All the more impressive, he was only NUMBER years old.PERSON has easy plus raw power from the left side of the plate and more home run upside than most middle infielders. He has quick hands and surprising strength for someone listed at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds. In order to hit for average at higher levels, he'll need to tighten his strike zone and do a better job of using the entire field.PERSON has average speed and solid arm strength, and the ORGANIZATION believe he can stay at shortstop if he works on his defense. He also has seen action at second and third base, and he could profile offensively at both positions.",0
"The second of three straight high school hitters taken in the first round of the Draft by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON comes from a baseball family. His older brother, PERSON, reached the big leagues with the ORGANIZATION and is now in the ORGANIZATION organization, and his father, PERSON, coached the NUMBERU ORGANIZATION for ORGANIZATION in NUMBER and has served as the head coach at ORGANIZATION in GPE, La., since NUMBER.PERSON fits the description of a real ""baseball player,"" the type who's whole is greater than the sum of his parts. He does have an advanced approach at the plate, putting up good walk rates and low strikeout rates as he's progressed through the ORGANIZATION' system. Added strength has helped allay concerns that PERSON wouldn't be able to handle the bat at the highest level, and while he'll never be a home run guy, he can hit the gaps consistently for extra bases. Just an average runner, his instincts, hands and arm should allow him to play shortstop at the highest level, though some inconsistencies with his throwing led to an increasing number of errors in NUMBER.The ORGANIZATION believe PERSON has the goods to do just that, though there could be a middle-infield logjam in the near future. The good news is he shouldn't have any problem shifting over to second or breaking in as a utility type.",1
"After appearing in NUMBER games out of the bullpen at FACILITY as a true freshman, PERSON transferred to PERSON & PERSON and sat out all of NUMBER. He pitched to mix results as a redshirt sophomore in his first season with The ORGANIZATION, posting a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA but also averaging NUMBER strikeouts-per-nine. Intrigued by PERSON's arm strength and untapped potential, the PERSON selected him in the third round of the NUMBER Draft and signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER. Making his full-season debut in NUMBER, PERSON split the year between Class A Hagerstown and high Class A Potomac, garnering All-Star honors in the LOCATION League before wearing down late in the season.PERSON's velocity has ticked up in NUMBER after dipping in his first full season, and the PERSON have been impressed with how he's developed feel to pitch and maintained effectiveness. Specifically, he took a big step forward in commanding his fastball, which sits in the low-to-mid NUMBERs with heavy sink and run that helped him generate ground balls NUMBER percent of the time in NUMBER. His curveball and slider will bleed together at times, though he did make strides in developing the latter in 'NUMBER, throwing it with more tilt and late, sharp bite in the mid-NUMBERs. PERSON rounds out his four-pitch mix with a changeup that could become average with further refinement.The PERSON will continue to develop PERSON as a starter because they think it will give him a chance to refine his secondaries. But the expectation has always been that he will end up in the bullpen, where his stuff is likely to play up in shorter bursts.",0
"Better known as a catcher, PERSON created a stir among scouts when he took the mound at a NUMBER Area Code Games tryout and flashed a NUMBER-mph fastball and a curveball with depth. He entered this year with the chance to go early in the Draft as a pitcher, but his mechanics were a mess and his performance disappointing during the spring. The FACILITY opted to draft him for the power in his bat rather than his arm, signing him for an above-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER in the sixth round.With the strength in his massive NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound frame, PERSON can drive balls a long way. He's more slugger than hitter right now, so he'll need to make adjustments to his approach to tap into his power on a consistent basis. His home run ceiling ranks among the best in GPE's system.PERSON has to learn a new position because he immediately converted from catcher to first base after turning pro. He has uncommon arm strength for the position and could make the throws from third base, but he lacks the quickness for the hot corner.",0
"The ORGANIZATION' ninth-round pick in NUMBER, GPE advanced to Double-A for the first time in NUMBER. He showed more consistency in the LOCATION, posting a sub-NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in three of the first four months of the season, only to have his campaign end a month early due to elbow tendinitis. Injuries continued to plague GPE in NUMBER, when he missed more a month of action during the middle of the season as the result of a left rib injury.GPE has impressive pure stuff and a track record of missing bats, as he averaged NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts per nine innings for his career headed into NUMBER. He throws his fastball downhill from his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame, though the velocity tends to vary from outing to outing, as he'll sometimes pitch in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range but typically sits in the low NUMBERs. His changeup is his out pitch and he also throws a slider, though it's behind the other two pitches.The biggest challenge for GPE has been commanding his fastball. When he can throw the pitch for strikes, and complement it with that changeup, he has the potential to dominate. Though he'll remain a starter for now, GPE, with his stuff and bat-missing ability, could jump on the fast track to the big leagues with a move to the bullpen.",1
"It may have seemed like a bit of nepotism when the ORGANIZATION selected PERSON, the son of then-general manager PERSON, as a college senior in the NUMBER Draft. Those whispers subsided when the ORGANIZATION product hit and ran his way to Double-A in his first full season. The ORGANIZATION certainly noticed, trading for PERSON during the offseason. His best tool is his speed, which plays up even more because of his excellent instincts on the basepaths as well as in the outfield. He understands his job is to get on base and he's willing to do that by drawing a walk, bunting his way on or just by simply hitting with an outstanding approach at the plate. He has a below-average arm, but it's accurate, and his ability to cover ground makes him a solid defender in center field.After finishing second in the ORGANIZATION organization in both hits and stolen bases in NUMBER, PERSON is very excited to see what kind of catalyst PERSON can become as he embarks on his ORGANIZATION career.",0
"PERSON was having another outstanding year offensively during his full-season debut when a line drive to his face shelved him for six weeks. He did perform well after returning, continuing to be one of the better prospects in the ORGANIZATION' system. He has a knack for making consistent hard contact with good bat speed coming from a low-hands setup. He does have a little power, but will likely be more of a contact, on-base guy as he progresses. PERSON does have decent speed, better under way, but likely isn't going to be a major basestealer. Starting out as an outfielder, he made the move to second base and made some progress there, though there's obviously still work to be done. A move back to the outfield, where he played some over the winter, is always an option, though his bat -- his ticket to the big leagues -- would profile better at second base.",0
"PERSON set a since-broken international bonus record when he signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million in NUMBER, but injuries prevented him from ever getting untracked in the ORGANIZATION system. He missed his first season with elbow tendinitis and his third while recovering from PERSON surgery. He pitched just NUMBER innings in six years as an GPE farmhand before joining the FACILITY as part of the ORGANIZATION trade last December.In order to keep him healthy, the A's made him PERSON a full-time reliever in NUMBER, and he'll stay in that role with GPE. He still has the size and arm strength that made him rich, throwing fastballs that sit at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touch NUMBER on a tough downhill plane.PERSON's No. NUMBER pitch is a slider that's more notable for its power than its break. He'll also mix in an occasional changeup, though it's very much a work in progress, as are his control and command.

He knows how to work counts and takes advantage of pitches he can drive. He produces above-average raw power, though it comes with a fair amount of swing-and-miss. PERSON was a shortstop in high school and moved to third base as a professional. The ORGANIZATION moved him to the outfield after his acquisition and he's made a solid transition to left. No matter where he ends up defensively, it'll be up to his bat to carry him through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Signing PERSON cost the ORGANIZATION their first round pick in NUMBER, making PERSON their top selection. He is built like a prototypical GPE right-hander and has the power arm to match.  PERSON throws his fastball in the mid-NUMBERs with heavy sinking action. His best secondary pitch is his slider, but it needs more development to become a true weapon. Though his command improved after he signed, he remains more of a thrower than a pitcher.  PERSON has a lot of upside, but many scouts feel he is destined to move to the bullpen. His fastball is good enough to give him a chance to close if he does change roles.",0
"The ORGANIZATION used their first overall pick (in the second round) in the NUMBER Draft on PERSON, an athletic and projectable right-hander from the ORGANIZATION prep ranks. He was eased into pro ball, spending two seasons in GPE ball before finally advancing to full-season Class A Wisconsin in NUMBER and pitching well there. PERSON continued to make strides the following year, reaching the ORGANIZATION State League, but had his entire NUMBER campaign wiped out by PERSON surgery that also cost him a portion of the 'NUMBER season. After struggling as starter upon his return from a NUMBER-month layoff, PERSON was moved to the bullpen in NUMBER and immediately took to the new role, showing improved velocity and a knack for missing bats at ORGANIZATION en route to a Futures Game selection in July. As a starter, PERSON operated with a low-NUMBERs fastball and flashed a plus breaking ball. But after tacking on some muscle while recovering from surgery, he's sitting at NUMBER-NUMBER mph out of the 'pen and at times touching NUMBER mph. He's learned to be aggressive with his heater, throwing it with late life that enables him to consistently beat hitters up in the zone His changeup features a NUMBER-NUMBER mph demarcation in velocity off of his fastball and has emerged as his best secondary weapon post-surgery, while his mid- to upper-NUMBERs slider gives him a third Major League-caliber offering. His control has improved along with stuff, though he still has gains to make with his command.The physical strength PERSON added during his rehab process has made him a more durable pitcher, and he's had no issues working multiple innings in NUMBER.

He was limited to only NUMBER games during his professional debut due to injury as he underwent surgery to repair a partially torn right labrum in October, and then had arthroscopic surgery the following February to clean up the same shoulder. PERSON did not appear in a game in NUMBER.When PERSON was healthy, he showed the potential for average or better tools across the board. The right-handed hitter stands out the most for his bat, utilizing a short, compact swing to spray line drives from line to line. While PERSON displayed good raw power before the injury, his swing is more likely to produce doubles than home runs as he moves up the ladder.PERSON's blend of athleticism and tools gives him a high floor behind the plate, but his arm strength obviously is a concern going forward, with a pair of shoulder surgeries to his name. To make up for the lost time, he is likely to receive at-bats at both first base and designated hitter in NUMBER when he's not catching, and there are some scouts who believe he could handle an outfield corner.",0
"A polished receiver and cat-like ball-blocker with a laser arm, PERSON was one of this century's best defensive amateur backstops while at ORGANIZATION. He fell to round three of his draft because of concerns about his bat, concerns that turned out to be well-founded, as PERSON had stark contact issues last year when he was tested at ORGANIZATION and the ORGANIZATION. A pairing of patience and pull power probably provides PERSON with a shot to approach the low offensive bar at the catcher position. He might hit .NUMBER but still yank out NUMBER annual homers, walk a bunch, and end up hitting well-enough to play every day for someone. His glove alone makes him a high-probability big leaguer, at least as an uber-gloved backup.",0
"Few teams can match the ORGANIZATION' recent track record of unearthing talent in the later rounds of the GPE. Yet another example is PERSON, a $NUMBER,NUMBER senior sign in the NUMBERth round in NUMBER. He came out of GPE and is similar to the best player that program ever has produced, PERSON has more bat speed and strength than a typical middle infielder, giving him at least average power. While he expands his strike zone on occasion, he doesn't swing and miss excessively and should hit for some average as well. With a little more discipline, he could be a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER-NUMBER homers per season.A third baseman in college, PERSON has divided his time between the hot corner and second base as a pro. He has soft hands and good actions up the middle, and enough arm to play the hot corner when needed.",0
"PERSON got white-hot during the Longhorns NUMBER postseason run and hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/NUMBER.NUMBER in the team's eight ORGANIZATION tournament games, boosting his junior-year line to .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER homers, which ranked second in the country. The ORGANIZATION made him the top pick on Day NUMBER of the NUMBER draft and he finished the year with a strong month and a half at Low-A, often against pitching worse than what he faced in college. 
He has a very pretty left-handed swing and can move the bat head around the zone, but PERSON doesn't always track or diagnose pitches well. He may be a swing-and-miss risk against better pro pitching, but what he does may still be enough at second base, assuming PERSON can stay there. At best, teams think he'll be an inoffensive second baseman, with some projecting PERSON to third base or an outfield corner. One source compared him to current NUMBER FV prospect PERSON. That type of outcome -- a compact body with power, some issues against breaking stuff, below average defense but at a premium position -- would be a good outcome for a third rounder.",0
"Despite the small balls-in-play sample, PERSON's stark drop in groundball rate from NUMBER to NUMBER gave us great hope for his offensive potential and had us buying in to his short-lived power output. While he continued to lift the ball more in NUMBER, the game power returned to career norms, way down in the .NUMBER ISO, .NUMBER SLG area. PERSON remains fleet of foot and is a reputable defensive center fielder. That alone should earn him a big league bench outfield role at some point (he's not on the NUMBER-man yet), but we got ahead of ourselves last year with regards to his bat, which is likely too light for PERSON to be an everyday player.",0
"PERSON led his GPE team to the NUMBER ORGANIZATION World Series junior division title and played in the Under PERSON All-America Game that summer, establishing himself as arguably the best hitter in the NUMBER international crop. When PERSON signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million and PERSON for $NUMBER.NUMBER million on the same day, the industry consensus was that PERSON was the better prospect. While he hasn't developed as quickly as GPE, he has made huge strides the last two seasons and reached Triple-A at age NUMBER last year.PERSON is at his best when he keeps his left-handed swing compact and focuses on drilling line drives to all fields. He'll lengthen his stroke when he gets power hungry, but he's starting to understand that he'll run into enough homers with his bat speed and leverage. While there's a good chance that he finds a happy medium where he hits for average and power, he hasn't shown much patience and won't draw a lot of walks.Because he lacks quick-twitch athleticism and is a well below-average runner, PERSON only can play first base. His range is limited but he has worked diligently to become a passable defender. He presents a big target and does a nice job of scooping throws out of the dirt.",1
"The ORGANIZATION spent a Draft-record $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER on bonuses in NUMBER, including $NUMBER,NUMBER for PERSON in the NUMBERth round. He might have gone in the top five rounds if not for questions about his signability, which persisted even after he switched his college commitment from GPE to LOCATION California.PERSON's best pitch is his curveball, a plus downer when he stays on top of it. He usually pitches at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and tops out at NUMBER with his fastball, which could add a bit more velocity in the future and features nice run and sink. He also shows good feel and deception with his changeup.While his athleticism should help him repeat his delivery, PERSON has a long arm action and struggles to keep everything in sync. He doesn't have a true out pitch, so he'll need to be finer with his control and command as he progresses through the Minors.",0
"The GPE right-hander struggled with arm trouble in the early stages of his career, but things started to click for him in NUMBER as he reached Double-A as a starter. While he did get to Triple-A in the rotation in NUMBER, his performance was not as consistent, so the ORGANIZATION moved him into the bullpen in NUMBER. The results were positive as he began the year in Double-A and ended it in GPE. The older brother of ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON, PERSON uses a very good two-pitch power arsenal now that he's in relief. He'll touch NUMBER mph with his fastball that has some sinking action to it. When he's in sync, delivery-wise, his slider can be above average. He struggled with his command during his big league debut but should get the opportunity to show he belongs full-time.",1
"Obtained from the ORGANIZATION at the NUMBER PERSON in return for PERSON, PERSON has long been on radars because of his pure arm strength. He had an up-and-down first full season with the organization, but there were encouraging signs in terms of his durability and his delivery.At his best, PERSON will show a fastball in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range and a power breaking ball that can miss bats. The ORGANIZATION saw a changeup better than the breaking ball at times, giving him the chance to eventually have three above-average pitches. When PERSON arrived, he used a delivery where he threw across his body, but he's worked to have better direction to the plate. In time, that should help his overall command. PERSON does need to manage his frustrations and his effort level from start to start. He was displeased he was back in the ORGANIZATION State League in NUMBER and that did seem to impact his energy. He'd be up to NUMBER mph in some starts, but would be NUMBER-NUMBER mph in others. He worked with PERSON about maintaining his intensity and having close friend PERSON now in the system may help his comfort level as well.",1
"Following in the footsteps of his older brother Conor, an All-American at ORGANIZATION State first-round (ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall) pick of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON received All-America honors as the ORGANIZATION' top hitter en route to becoming the NUMBERth overall pick in the NUMBER Draft. After a strong NUMBER season in which he led ORGANIZATION farmhands with NUMBER homers and an .NUMBER OPS while reaching Triple-A, he slumped this year in his return to GPE. PERSON traded him to the FACILITY in July for PERSON Jennings.A big, physical switch-hitter, PERSON's power is mostly strength-driven but a solid tool nonetheless. He shows it from both sides but does a majority of his damage from the left, the source of NUMBER of his home runs in NUMBER. His bat speed is only above average and there is some swing-and-miss to his game, but the overall swing is consistent, and he's long demonstrated an advanced feel for the zone with strong on-base skills. A well-below-average runner, PERSON is smooth enough around the bag to be a league-average defender at first base. With his strong on-base skills and power potential, PERSON shows the makings of becoming an everyday contributor at the highest level.",0
"If PERSON had the frame of GPE, he might have received more attention. His tools should allow him to eventually get more acclaim as he moves up the ORGANIZATION' ladder.The GPE outfielder who got just over $NUMBER million to sign with the ORGANIZATION will still be a teenager for the NUMBER season, but he gave full-season ball a try, more than holding his own in the LOCATION. PERSON has solid tools across the board and upside to spare. The center fielder runs well, and he has the ability to steal a base and cover ground in the outfield. PERSON's bat may carry him up the ladder, with the chance to hit for both average and surprising power, given his size.Pittsburgh has considerable depth in the outfield, from the big leagues all the way down, so there's no need to rush PERSON. But the payoff could be considerable.",0
"GPE might not be the baseball hotbed that other countries in that part of the world are, but it's obviously produced some high-level talent over the years. GPE doesn't project to have a ORGANIZATION kind of impact -- who does? -- but his stuff, feel for pitching and athleticism all do point to a future on a big league mound.Young for his level, GPE performed well in full-season ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION a year ago, showing three average to a tick above-average offerings. His fastball will sit in the low-NUMBERs with good life and there could be a fair amount more to come as he physically matures. His changeup could develop into a plus pitch eventually as well, thrown with good deception and movement. His curve is a half-step behind, but is a Major ORGANIZATION average breaking ball. All of GPE's stuff plays up because he commands the zone so well, as evidenced by his NUMBER.NUMBER walk per nine innings ratio over the course of his young career. That's not likely to change as he utilizes a very easy and repeatable delivery.GPE isn't overly projectable, at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, but there are likely to be gains as he gets stronger. Combine that with his plus pitchability and he has the look of a solid No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter who could start moving a bit faster.",1
"The ORGANIZATION looked like they had found a steal in the seventh round of the NUMBER Draft in nabbing PERSON, who pitched at three colleges before signing with the ORGANIZATION. He jumped on a fast track by going from A ball to Double-A in his first full season and had advanced to Triple-A in NUMBER when he blew out his elbow in June and needed PERSON surgery.When healthy, PERSON has four pitches that he can go to in order to get hitters out. He'll pitch at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball typically, but he can reach back for NUMBER-NUMBER mph when he needs it. On any given night, one breaking ball is better than the other, and he's more than willing to toggle back and forth based on which one he has a better feel for. He'll often throw a true curve early in counts to get ahead, and the slider becomes more of a strikeout pitch. He'll mix a solid average changeup in as well and he's generally around the strike zone with all of them.The hope is that PERSON will be back before the season is over, though it really will be NUMBER before he's at full strength. He was knocking on the door before the injury; there's no reason to think he won't be back there once he's NUMBER percent.",0
"Signed for just $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER out of GPE, PERSON's pro debut in NUMBER saw him play in the ORGANIZATION, rookie-level ORGANIZATION and even the ORGANIZATION. He jumped on the scene with a strong showing back with PERSON in NUMBER, hitting for average and showing some emerging power.PERSON is a toolsy outfielder who does everything full-tilt. An aggressive hitter, he has a knack for making contact while swinging at almost everything, and he'll have to improve his approach as he moves up the ladder. There is extra-base pop now and he could develop more home run power as he matures physically and learns to be more selective. His speed works on both sides of the ball, showing basestealing ability and solid skills in center field. He has a strong arm to go with his range and instincts.It can be a mistake to ask a player like PERSON to tone things down too much because it's his energy and aggressiveness that make him an exciting player. Learning to reign it in just enough to succeed as the competition improves could allow him to move up prospect lists in a hurry.",0
"PERSON was the first high school catcher drafted in NUMBER, with scouts being really attracted by his bat. Though he made strides behind the plate as a professional, PERSON was moved to the outfield by the D-backs in NUMBER.PERSON has a strong arm, and he has enough athleticism to be an adequate defender in time. His bat, however, remains the primary attraction. PERSON's bat speed and strength create plenty of raw power. How much of that power he is able to use remains to be seen. There's a lot of swing-and-miss in his game, and he will have to improve his pitch-recognition skills to reach his offensive potential.At NUMBER years old, PERSON still has time on his side as he works to make the necessary adjustments. But his struggles in his first experience in full-season ball show that he still has a long way to go.",0
"PERSON had the best season of his young career as a NUMBER-year old in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION native set career highs in nearly every offensive category, while also taking a step forward defensively. PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate for his age, showing a good understanding of the strike zone and a knack for hitting. His strength produces solid power and he gets to it in games well.Defensively, PERSON still has some work to do. He has above-average arm strength and threw out NUMBER percent of would-be basestealers in NUMBER. Like most young catchers, he'll need to continue to improve his receiving and game management as he advances in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON's pitchability enough to draft him in the third round in NUMBER, then helped him refine a more balanced delivery in hopes of improving his velocity and command. It worked, as he led the low Class GPE ORGANIZATION in strikeouts (NUMBER) and strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) in his first full pro season. He earned mid-season promotions in each of the next two years and was the most successful starter at the hitter's haven that is Triple-A Albuquerque last summer.PERSON works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and can hit NUMBER with his fastball, though with less sink than he showed early in his pro career. His groundout/airout ratio shrunk from NUMBER.NUMBER in his first two seasons to NUMBER.NUMBER in his next two. There are nights when his deceptive changeup is his best pitch and it's the main reason he has been more successful against right-handers than left-handers. PERSON's slider gives him an average third offering. While he provides consistent strikes, his lack of a true plus pitch means he has to be precise with his location. He could be a No. NUMBER starter if he can improve his slider and command.",0
"PERSON might have gone in the top five rounds of the NUMBER Draft based on talent, but signability dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBERth round. After a late-season surge left him leading the LOCATION with NUMBER homers entering ORGANIZATION tournament play this year, the ORGANIZATION product was selected by the ORGANIZATION in the second round, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER. PERSON hit .NUMBER with a total of nine homers in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION, and he struck out in NUMBER percent of his plate appearances and slugged just .NUMBER with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION last summer. He did a much better job of recognizing offspeed pitches and making contact as a junior, all the while driving the ball more consistently and showing enough bat speed and strength for at least average power.With solid speed and instincts, PERSON should be able to stick in center field, where his arm is strong, relative to the position. His quickness should enable him to steal a few bases, but he needs to refine his technique. PERSON may not have a true plus tool, but he's at least average across the board and can play up the middle.",0
"All reports about PERSON coming out of the GPE high school ranks for the NUMBER PERSON stated that he was an all-glove, little-bat shortstop. In his brief career to date, he's lived up to the hype defensively while initially showing a little more offensive aptitude than anticipated. In his full-season debut in NUMBER, his bat cooled off considerably.PERSON will always be a defensive-minded infielder, one who can undoubtedly stay at shortstop for a long time. He uses his speed for above-average range, has outstanding hands and instincts to go along with an average (perhaps a tick above) arm. While PERSON is never likely to have much home run power, he's shown more strength at the plate. The fear was once that he would have the bat knocked out of his hands, especially as he progressed, but he's shown some ability to drive the ball to the gaps with some extra-base authority.If he can get back to doing that, it would bode well for his future hitability, though he'll have to continue to refine his approach at the plate to succeed in the future. His glove should carry him up the ladder; if the bat comes back, he could be an everyday shortstop at the highest level.",0
"PERSON served as both a reliever and a starter at ORGANIZATION. He does profile better as a reliever and could move quickly if he settles into that kind of role as a professional.The fourth-rounder's best pitch is a legitimate swing-and-miss slider that can sit in the mid NUMBERs and features late tilt. PERSON commands it better than his fastball, which usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and tops out at NUMBER. He could add a tick or two of velocity if he focuses on full-time bullpen duty.Though his strong build gives him the durability to be a starter, PERSON has some effort in his delivery and doesn't always repeat his mechanics consistently. His changeup lags behind his fastball and slider, but he could scrap it pitching in shorter relief stints.",0
"One of the more advanced players in the NUMBER international class, PERSON has a long track record of performing, both at international events such as the NUMBER Cal PERSON (he was NUMBER) and the NUMBER NUMBER-and-under PERSON championships and during game action in the ORGANIZATION. Impressed by his aptitude, the ORGANIZATION signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million last June.He impresses scouts with his ability in center field, drawing comparisons to the ORGANIZATION' PERSON because he's a quality defender despite just average speed. PERSON has tremendous instincts, reading balls off the bat and taking direct routes to chase down balls from gap to gap. His average arm strength plays up too because he gets rid of the ball quickly and makes accurate throws.A rare lefthanded thrower who hits right-handed, PERSON has a quick bat and feel for hitting. While his swing can get long at times and there was less scouting consensus about his bat than his glove, PERSON believes that he'll make consistent contact and could have average power once he matures physically.",0
PERSON didn't sign as the #NUMBER overall pick last year of GPE due to a failed physical because of his elbow. His medicals are out now and how teams interpret them will dicate if he goes mid-NUMBERst round or slides to the NUMBERnd.,0
"Before the ORGANIZATION made him their fifth-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON, as a junior at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, ranked third in the Pac-NUMBER Conference in strikeouts. He thrived in his first full season, pacing all Nats Minor Leaguers in whiffs and finishing the year at ORGANIZATION, and he led the LOCATION with NUMBER strikeouts in his return to the level in NUMBER.PERSON usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball but can run it as high as NUMBER-NUMBER. The pitch has natural cutting action, and his velocity consistently plays up because he hides the ball well. PERSON's slider and changeup give him two Major League-caliber secondary offerings, with the former slightly ahead of the latter. His above-average control helps him miss bats despite lacking overpowering stuff.Physically strong and durable, PERSON has a bright future as a back-of-the-rotation innings eater. With his continued success this season at the Triple-A level, PERSON is on the cusp of emerging as a viable rotation candidate for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Originally a shortstop in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON signed for a bargain $NUMBER,NUMBER as a pitcher in October NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION brought him along slowly, having him spend his first two years in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, but he has emerged as one of their better pitching prospects while making his GPE debut in NUMBER. With a strong performance in extended spring training, he skipped a level and headed to the short-season LOCATION League.Bigger than his listed NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds, PERSON looks like a power pitcher and has the radar-gun readings to match. He already works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball and is capable of reaching NUMBER mph. He uses his size to leverage the fastball down in the strike zone.PERSON's secondary pitchers are works in progress, though he has some power to his curveball and some feel for his changeup. He has a sound delivery and repeats it well, so he has no issues throwing strikes.",0
"PERSON has been well traveled since the FACILITY drafted him in the second round in NUMBER. First, he was sent to the D-backs in the ORGANIZATION trade at the NUMBER PERSON. He worked his way from rookie ball to the ORGANIZATION with PERSON, making his big league debut in August NUMBER. That winter, he was dealt again, this time to the ORGANIZATION as a part of a three-team trade. PERSON has the chance to have four average or better pitches with good command of all of them. He works quickly and goes right after hitters, working both sides of the strike zone with his solid average sinking fastball. His fading changeup is an above-average offering and he throws both a tight biting curve and short, cutting slider. With good mechanics and size, he should be ready for the middle of the rotation very soon.",1
"He doesn't throw especially hard but the baseball appears to explode out of PERSON's hand, and it often gets on hitters much quicker than they're expecting. Acquired in that massive, three-team, PERSON deal, PERSON is a curvaceous NUMBER-foot righty with several above-average pitches and average command. Much of the industry thought he was a reliever coming out of college, but the ORGANIZATION and PERSON bought in on PERSON as a starter, and they appear to have been correct.",0
"PERSON was a solid catching prospect coming out of high school, a very flexible, athletic backstop who is a black belt in karate. While some worry that he's lost some of that behind the plate, some success with his bat, coupled with the usual dearth of college catching, helped the ORGANIZATION of FACILITY backstop become a third-round Draft pick in NUMBER.A ORGANIZATION Cod League All-Star, PERSON has shown some ability at the plate and increased his power output in each of his three years as a starter at FACILITY. Some of that has come because he's a good guess hitter and pulls balls out of the park, but some scouts feel he has become too spread out at the plate with his PERSON Bryant-like stance. In the past, he has shown solid defensive skills and a solid arm, though reports out of the ORGANIZATION and this spring about his defense have not been overwhelmingly positive.PERSON is big and strong; the raw power is legitimate. The ORGANIZATION believe they can get him back to tapping into it with a better setup at the plate, all while helping him to refine his defensive play.",0
"Signed as a third baseman out of GPE in NUMBER, ORGANIZATION spent two seasons each in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION and the short-season LOCATION, beginning his conversion to catcher in NUMBER. He's having a breakout year at the plate in NUMBER, and scouts who don't believe that PERSON is a catcher think ORGANIZATION is the ORGANIZATION' best in-house option at the position.Developing more strike-zone discipline has been the key to ORGANIZATION' offensive improvement. It also should help him start translating his solid raw power to all fields into home run production. He has the upside of a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER homers on an annual basis.ORGANIZATION' arm strength and athleticism prompted his move from third base to catcher. He's quicker than most backstops and can shut down the running game. He still needs work on his receiving but has made strides in that regard.",0
"PERSON first attracted the attention of scouts when he hit NUMBER mph as a GPE (Mo.) JC freshman. He helped his cause by performing well against better competition as a reliever and a starter in two years at ORGANIZATION, earning a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER. He has been a steady performer as a pro and moved up to Double-A by mid-NUMBER.PERSON owns a pair of solid offerings in his fastball, which sits in the low NUMBERs and tops out at NUMBER, and his changeup, which features some tumble. His slider gives him a decent breaking ball, and he also employs a curveball at times. PERSON' delivery features effort and deception but doesn't prevent him from throwing strikes.His long-term role is unclear. PERSON doesn't miss a ton of bats or maintain his velocity in the late innings, which may mean he's better suited for the bullpen. He also is around the plate with four pitches and doesn't have a breaking ball that will neutralize left-handers in a relief role, so he might have a brighter future as a back-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"Early in NUMBER, PERSON looked like the best high school pitching prospect in GPE after PERSON (who went NUMBERth overall to the GPE) and PERSON (who got first-round money in the second round from the ORGANIZATION). PERSON's velocity and stock dipped as the ORGANIZATION approached, though he still commanded a $NUMBER million bonus from the ORGANIZATION as a third-rounder. He was the first player ever selected out of GPE (ORGANIZATION, GPE), the alma mater of big leaguer PERSON Collins.After working with a low-NUMBERs fastball as a sophomore, PERSON picked up velocity as he began to mature physically. He now operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and can peak at NUMBER, and he could throw harder in the future because he still has a lot of projection remaining on his gangly NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. He generates high spin rates on his heater, giving it riding life that helps it avoid barrels.PERSON also has shown high spin rates on his curveball in the past, though he has had more success with a harder slider that he added last spring. His changeup is in its nascent changes and doesn't have enough separation in velocity from his fastball yet. While he has a slingy delivery, it didn't prevent him from filling the strike zone in his pro debut.",1
"PERSON tapped LOCATION A&M JC for a pair of GPE picks in NUMBER, grabbing right-hander LOCATION in the NUMBERth round and GPE in the NUMBERth.

While playing at a launching pad at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lancaster boosted his numbers, he performed even better in Double-A and continued to stand out in the ORGANIZATION, but he struggled in a return to Double-A this year before going to the A's in a November trade. He's a similar athlete to fellow PERSON outfield prospect PERSON, though GPE is a better pure hitter with less power potential. He has good patience and uses the entire field, though there are some concerns about how much his simple right-handed swing will translate into power against better pitching. If he can cut down his strikeout rate, he could become a high-OBP player with NUMBER-NUMBER homers per year.GPE could fit nicely in the leadoff spot because he pairs his on-base skills with plus speed and the know-how to steal bases. He's more of an average defender in center field, better on the corners and capable of playing all three spots with his average arm. Nicknamed ""The ORGANIZATION"" for his relentless work ethic, he'll get the most out of his ability.",0
"PERSON entered his junior season looking like a top-two-rounds college pitcher, but his stock took a hit when he missed six weeks with a strained oblique. He was up-and-down after his return, but turned it up a notch near the end of his season at ORGANIZATION, and the D-backs saw enough to take him in the third round and give him $NUMBER,NUMBER to sign, just a tick below pick value.At his best, PERSON displays three plus pitches, starting with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that reaches NUMBER mph and features some run and sink. Hitters have a difficult time laying off his low-NUMBERs slider, giving him a second swing-and-miss pitch. There are times when his changeup is his most effective secondary offering, sitting in the low NUMBERs with similar action to his heater.Inconsistency plagued PERSON throughout his career and he's often struggled with command, which has led to him being more hittable than he should be given his stuff. That, plus some effort in a delivery he doesn't always repeat, lead some to believe his big league future will be out of the bullpen.",0
"â¢ NUMBER/NUMBER: PERSON makes NUMBER debutAt the start of his junior season at GPE in NUMBER, PERSON was viewed as a possible No. NUMBER pick for that June's Draft. An inconsistent junior year dropped him from the top spot, but the A's were happy to take him with the sixth overall selection and gave him just over $NUMBER million to sign him. He made it to Double-A in his first full season and pitched in the ORGANIZATION and seemed poised to make the leap to GPE in NUMBER. He was derailed from the fast track when he needed PERSON surgery last April.In NUMBER, PERSON led the Minors with his NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts-per-nine, a testament to a full repertoire of outstanding stuff. He'll throw his fastball up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph and he uses one of the best sliders in the Minors, to miss a ton of bats. He mixes in a curveball and his changeup, once a distant fourth pitch, has become a devastating out pitch as well, flashing plus at times. He uses his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame very well, with excellent extension.PERSON had improved his ability to find the strike zone as his first full season wore on, though there might be a learning curve command-wise as he returns from elbow surgery. Assuming he can get back to where he was in terms of that and his feel for all of his pitches, he should still be able to reach his ceiling as a No. NUMBER type starter.",1
"After a strong full-season debut in NUMBER, it looked like PERSON was starting to establish himself as an up-and-coming third-base prospect, one with the kind of power profile teams like to see from a corner infielder. An NUMBER-game suspension following a positive test for the performance-enhancing drugs ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION leave everything somewhat in doubt.The ORGANIZATION had kept PERSON back in extended spring camp in NUMBER to get the left-handed hitter to use the opposite field more. He bought in and was driving balls off the left-center-field wall early in his GPE ORGANIZATION season. While PERSON has decent contact skills, he needs to refine his approach to see more pitches and draw more walks so he can tap into his raw power more. His defense at third is below average, so he might have to move across the diamond to first. Consistency in the field has been an issue for PERSON, with some mechanical issues and subpar actions at times.PERSON came a long way in a short time, and there was hope he could develop into an average hitter with solid in-game power. The suspension puts a cloud over all of those projections.",0
"PERSON went undrafted out of a GPE high school in NUMBER and then played sparingly as a freshman for ORGANIZATION before nearly winning the LOCATION Triple Crown and then starring in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. He repeated as ORGANIZATION player of the year in NUMBER and ultimately took home the prestigious ORGANIZATION after contending for the ORGANIZATION Division I lead in batting (.NUMBER), on-base percentage (.NUMBER), home runs (NUMBER) and runs (NUMBER). The ORGANIZATION were elated to find PERSON still on the board with the NUMBERth overall pick, and they signed him for slot value at $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER two days later. PERSON got off to a strong start in the LOCATION only to have his pro debut come to an abrupt end when he tore his ORGANIZATION, medial and lateral meniscus in his right knee during a home-plate collision on July NUMBER, resulting in season-ending surgery for the ORGANIZATION' top pick. With his leverage and bat speed, PERSON has easy pop to all fields. His swing is busier than most scouts would like, but his approach is generally sound and he ranked second among D-I hitters with a program-record NUMBER walks during the spring.PERSON is a fringy runner out of the batter's box, but he has solid speed once he gets going.

PERSON's best offensive tool will always be his speed, which plays well on both sides of the ball. He has the range, hands, arm and instincts to hold his position as well. PERSON's defense is ahead of his offense right now, but there is projection in his bat.PERSON is praised for his work ethic and makeup, and although it might take a while for him to reach his potential, there's no question he won't be outworked trying to get there.",0
"After scuffling in the lower PERSON for a few seasons, PERSON broke out in NUMBER. As a NUMBER-year-old, he moved up to Double-A Binghamton for the first time. He built on that progress in NUMBER and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut. PERSON has made impressive progress at the plate in the last two years. He has a knack for making contact and is extremely tough to strike out. His overall approach at the plate improved, and that helped him tap into his raw power more consistently. Initially a shortstop, PERSON now splits his time between second and third base, either of which is a much better home for him, given his lack of quickness. He has good hands and a strong arm, but the lack of range might continue to be an issue. PERSON' bat is ready to contribute soon, regardless of his position.",1
"PERSON was one of college baseball's top two-way players while at ORGANIZATION, doubling as the ORGANIZATION' ace and a line drive-hitting first baseman. Pro teams preferred him on the mound, and the ORGANIZATION made him the first first-round pick in school history, taking him NUMBERth overall in NUMBER. A year after signing for $NUMBER.NUMBER million, he arrived in the big leagues and won two games in the ORGANIZATION against the Dodgers.The son of PERSON minor league pitching coach PERSON, PERSON exudes polish on the mound. His best attributes are his changeup and his command. He repeatedly fools hitters with his changeup, which features some late sink, by selling it with deceptive arm speed.That's his lone better-than-average offering, but all of PERSON' pitches play up because of his ability to locate with precision and to add and subtract velocity. He throws an NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball with decent life and a mid-NUMBERs curveball with some depth. His ceiling may be limited to GPE. NUMBER starter, but he has a good chance of reaching it.",1
"GPE underwent PERSON surgery in July NUMBER as a ORGANIZATION of GPE sophomore and he didn't return to the mound until 'NUMBER, when the ORGANIZATION made him their fourth-round pick. He moved up to full-season ball in NUMBER and received a quick promotion to the Class A Advanced California League, where he was pitching when the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the ORGANIZATION deal at the ORGANIZATION. Two trips to the disabled list limited GPE to just NUMBER starts in NUMBER, and he was limited once again at Double-A early in 'NUMBER, when he missed time with his second right oblique strain in as many years. GPE pitched well upon his return and earned his Triple-A promotion in July. GPE has long possessed a power arm when healthy, sitting mostly in the mid-NUMBERs with a fastball that can touch NUMBER mph with good arm-side run. The right-hander complements his heater with a slider in the low- to mid-NUMBERs that flashes above average, and he also has a usable changeup. GPE's control has improved as he's climbed the ladder, but he still has gains to make in terms of his command. Despite GPE's checkered medical history, the ORGANIZATION have remained steadfast in developing the right-hander as a starter. Should that not work, GPE could have a bright future as a late-inning reliever with a fastball-slider pairing that's helped him neutralize right-handed hitters throughout his career.",0
"Originally selected NUMBERth overall by the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON opted not to sign and instead began his college career at ORGANIZATION State PERSON. He starred in the ORGANIZATION League the following summer and then transferred to the ORGANIZATION of LOCATION so he'd be eligible for the NUMBER Draft. The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON NUMBERth overall that June and signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER, and he was in the middle of an eye-opening full-season debut in 'NUMBER when PERSON dealt him to PERSON along with PERSON in exchange for PERSON at the Aug. NUMBER Trade Deadline. In December, PERSON received a NUMBER-game suspension following a second positive test for a drug of abuse. PERSON can hit NUMBER mph with a four-seam fastball and miss barrels with a low-NUMBERs two-seamer that features plenty of sink. His slider can be a plus pitch when his mechanics are in sync but also can get slurvy when he doesn't maintain his release point. He made strides with his changeup during his first instructional league with the ORGANIZATION and then made even more progress with the pitch in NUMBER.Though he's passed every test as a starter to begin his career, some scouts still think he's destined for the bullpen. He's a good athlete who usually fills the strike zone, but he sometimes lapses into overthrowing and has trouble maintaining his arm slot. His stuff is electric in short stints, so he's a potential closer if he can't make it in the rotation.",0
"After a long college season at ORGANIZATION, his first as a starting pitcher, PERSON didn't pitch a ton in the D-backs organization after they gave him full slot value as a second-round pick in the NUMBER Draft. What he showed in his brief debut has PERSON excited to see what happens next.PERSON pitched out of ORGANIZATION's bullpen his first two years there, then moved to the rotation as a junior, greatly raising his profile. The D-backs see him as a starter as well, even though he was very impressive as a late-inning reliever for a ORGANIZATION team that won the LOCATION title last summer. PERSON commands his tick-above-average fastball very well, throwing it with plenty of sink to elicit ground-ball outs. His wipeout slider is his best pitch, and it can be a true out pitch for the southpaw. PERSON's changeup is a bit behind the other two pitches, but it should give him a third Major League-average offering as he continues to use it more consistently.PERSON goes right after hitters with a reliever's mentality and a plus mound presence, but he has the command and repertoire to remain in a rotation.",0
"GSP's conditioning and future position had some concerned about the GPE prepster as he entered his senior year of high school. But GSP shed weight, improved his overall conditioning and had a fantastic season to move into the top half of the first round. Then he went out and had as good, if not the best, of any debut by a NUMBER draftee, finishing his summer in the full-season ORGANIZATION. GSP displayed outstanding bat speed and he should have above-average power in the future. He should become an even better all-around hitter as he learns to adjust to offspeed stuff. He's an average runner, maybe a tick above, but he's aggressive on the basepaths and should continue to steal some bases. It was initially assumed that GSP would have to move to third as a pro, and his bat would profile just fine there, but he's convinced many he can stay at shortstop with good hands, a well above-average arm and solid range. With his stunning debut, GSP could move more quickly than many high school hitters.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON was drafted out of GPE as a defensive-minded shortstop, and his glove work has done little to disappoint. How much he can advance with the bat will determine his ultimate role.A very polished infielder, PERSON can flat out pick it, with tremendous defensive tools to go along with good instincts and game awareness. He has outstanding speed, enough for him to steal more bases than he did in his first full season. While PERSON is an excellent bunter, he'll need to work on his offensive game if he wants to be a full-time shortstop. He's made some mechanical adjustments, like starting his hands back a little further, but it remains a work in progress.PERSON' glove will get him to the big leagues. His bat will dictate if he can start or if he ends up as a solid utilityman in the future.",0
"PERSON was overlooked in college, as is often the case at GPE, because of the program's glut of ptiching talent. He was drafted by GPE and traded to SF for PERSON. PERSON projects as a #NUMBER starter on the back of a NUMBER fastball, slider and command. He's pitching well at Double-A.",0
"Learning a new pitch and adding some velocity can go a long way to boost a pitcher's stock as a Draft prospect. PERSON, PERSON's Saturday starter, did both of those things and many teams, especially those who like statistical metrics and college performers, took notice.The biggest improvement has come via PERSON's new breaking ball, a slider that can be an above-average offering for him. Couple that with a fastball that he now throws in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, up a few ticks from the past, and PERSON has been dominant as a junior, missing more bats and giving up fewer hits. The right-hander will mix in a decent curveball and has a below-average changeup as well, but it's mostly been the fastball-slider combination that has made hitters uncomfortable all spring. He's around the strike zone with all of his offerings The LOCATION Conference might not be the nation's toughest, but any time a pitcher gives up just two earned runs in NUMBER innings of conference play, it's noteworthy. PERSON's ceiling might be somewhat limited, but the stats-leaning teams will likely be very interested in the top five or six rounds.",0
"A second-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON was PERSON's top starter that spring and won the Rookie-level PERSON's pitcher of the year award and strikeout title in his pro debut. A decrease in velocity and an inability to throw consistent strikes caught up to him at higher levels, so the ORGANIZATION decided to move him to the bullpen last July.PERSON throws harder than most left-handers, and once he switched to relief he returned to throwing his fastball at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touching NUMBER like he had in his debut. His hard slider can be a plus pitch at its best, though it can be unreliable at times too. He never has shown much feel for his changeup and likely will scrap it in his new role.PERSON has a lot going on in his delivery, which adds deception that makes him hard to hit but also makes it difficult to control and command his pitches on a regular basis. If he can develop even average strike-throwing ability, he could be a bullpen force.",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON a bit in NUMBER after he turned in a decent redshirt sophomore season at ORGANIZATION, taking a flier on him in the NUMBERth round. He went back to school rather than sign and had a huge year, catapulting him into first-round consideration. The ORGANIZATION were ready again, this time getting their man at ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall and signing him for full pick value. After a huge pro debut in the summer of NUMBER, PERSON was pushed to Double-A for his first full season, where he hit for power, but saw other parts of his offensive game regress.There is no question that PERSON's best position is batter's box. He's looking more like a power-over-hit type of offensive player, one with legitimate raw pop. He's always had swing and miss to his game, and his strikeout rate spiked with the aggressive move to Double-A. It's offset somewhat by his ability to draw walks and there's some hope that at his peak, he'll be a bit more well-rounded as a hitter than he was in NUMBER. He should be a good enough hitter for that power to play at any level.The big question surrounding PERSON is where he might play defensively. He saw time at first and left field in NUMBER, and the plan is to give him a consistent time split at both. He's below-average in both spots, with the hope that he can become adequate enough at one so he's not a DH at a very young age.",0
"The last time PERSON had a shortstop who garnered early-round consideration was in NUMBER, when PERSON was in the conversation for the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick and ended up going ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall to GPE. PERSON didn't rate that highly ahead of the NUMBER ORGANIZATION, but his track record of success and the fact that college shortstop performers always do well in the ORGANIZATION earned him a third-round selection by PERSON. PERSON continued to perform at ORGANIZATION A FACILITY in his first full season, when he ranked among the ORGANIZATION leaders in average (.NUMBER, fifth), hits (NUMBER, third), on-base pct. (.NUMBER, fifth) and runs (NUMBER, second). PERSON' best offensive skill is his plate discipline. After compiling more walks (NUMBER) than strikeouts (NUMBER) during his NUMBER-game college career, PERSON posted NUMBER walks against NUMBER strikeouts at FACILITY. He's a switch-hitter who grinds out at-bats, with a line-drive approach and some extra-base ability, albeit with below-average over-the-fence power. An above-average runner with strong instincts, he tied for second in the organization with NUMBER stolen bases. While he's not a flashy defender, PERSON makes all the plays at shortstop, with arm strength and range that both grade as a tick above average. He was named the ORGANIZATION of the Year by the ORGANIZATION department last season and should be able to stay up the middle long-term, either at short or second base. PERSON might profile best eventually as a super-utility type, but has a chance to succeed as an everyday player up the middle.",0
"The ORGANIZATION had their eyes on two college catchers in the NUMBER GPE class, PERSON from GPE and PERSON, from PERSON. PERSON went to the Dodgers at the end of the first round, but that was just as well for the ORGANIZATION, who liked PERSON's history better. They were able to nab him at the beginning of the second round and he advanced to full-season ball before his summer debut was over, the organization trying to pair him with first-rounder PERSON Senzel.PERSON was the best all-around catching prospect in the GPE class, with tools on both sides of the ball. There is some swing and miss to his offensive game, and he struggled during his first full season, though he has the tools to hit, and with some power, more from strength than bat speed. He's a good baserunner, especially for a catcher, and that athleticism plays behind the plate as well. While his arm is average, it's accurate and he's done a solid job of controlling the running game as a pro.PERSON is a natural leader behind the plate, the type who still could be a big league regular for a long time despite his sluggish first full year.",0
"It can be easy to overlook PERSON, who is listed at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER pounds. But the ORGANIZATION second-round pick in the NUMBER PERSON has a history of outperforming expectations.

He has quick wrists and squares up balls well, spraying line drives to all fields. He has below-average power and is an average runner. PERSON has the tools to become a capable defender at second base. He isn't flashy, but makes the routine plays well. While none of PERSON's tools stand out, his makeup and baseball instincts help raise the level of his overall game.",0
"One of two high school hitters taken in the first round by the Pirates in NUMBER, PERSON took a huge step forward in 'NUMBER. The key was staying healthy for an entire year, which enabled him to hit his way up to Double-A and participate in the ORGANIZATION. The injury bug struck again in NUMBER, with another hamstring issue, though he still managed to hit his way up to Triple-A.Especially considering last year was really his first full season, PERSON has a very advanced approach at the plate, particularly with plate discipline. He has a smooth left-handed swing geared mostly to hit. PERSON is still figuring himself out as a hitter, and the expectation is that the power many have projected will come from his big, strong frame as he puts that puzzle together. He made strides in center field and could be an above-average defender there. Even though PERSON doesn't have the strongest arm, it's accurate and plays well. He should get time in the outfield corners as well. PERSON runs well and will cover plenty of ground from any outfield spot.Because of the stacked outfield in GPE, there's no rush for PERSON. Given how much more polished he is than people initially thought, a year of upper-level at-bats should have him knocking on the door.",0
"It can sometimes be difficult for a ORGANIZATION II player to get noticed. PERSON put himself on the map with an All-Star season in the ORGANIZATION last summer, then kept right on dominating, en route to All-America honors and helping PERSON advance to the ORGANIZATION II Championship Tournament.PERSON is all about command, one who walked just NUMBER and struck out NUMBER during his regular season this spring. His fastball sits right around NUMBER mph and it plays up thanks to his abilty to move it to all quadrants of the zone. A nice little tight slider is his best offering, though it's not a huge strikeout pitch for him. His fringy curve is used more as a get-me-over pitch for strike one or as a chase pitch out of the zone with two strikes. He has feel for a changeup, but doesn't use it much. While PERSON has outstanding arm action and repeats his delivery well, a general lack of movement has some thinking he might end up in long relief. A team that saw him in the GPE, though, will give him every chance to make it as a back-end starter.",0
"Though there aren't many quality up-the-middle college players in the NUMBER Draft, GPE PERSON had two of the better ones in shortstop PERSON and PERSON. A former walk-on, PERSON for much of his freshman year and played first base for much of his sophomore season. He starred as a center fielder in the ORGANIZATION last summer and then continued to shine there this spring en route to being taken by the ORGANIZATION in the first competitive balance round.PERSON's ceiling is that of a top-of-the-order tablesetter in a big league lineup. He has a quick left-handed bat, an eye for drawing walks and a mature approach at the plate. He concentrates on making line-drive contact during games, and while there are some concerns about how much impact he'll make with his bat, he flashes some raw power in batting practice, especially to his pull side. PERSON uses his plus speed well on the bases and in center, though some scouts would like to see him take better routes on defense. His fringy arm strength is enough for his position, though it will limit his usefulness in right field if he becomes a fourth outfielder rather than a regular.",0
"PERSON hit NUMBER mph with his fastball as a freshman at GPE (Mo.) JC in NUMBER, but he went undrafted because he's small and was committed to GPE. After he proved himself as a reliever and a starter against tougher LOCATION competition, he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER. He reached Double-A midway through NUMBER and has established himself as one of the better lefty starting pitching prospects in a GPE system thin in that department.PERSON lacks a plus pitch, relying instead on mixing four offerings and deception to succeed. His fastball sits in the low NUMBERs and peaks at NUMBER with some run on it. His changeup regressed a bit in NUMBER but is solid once again, and his slider improved when he had to use it more often a year ago. He also uses a slow curveball to give batters a different look.His delivery isn't the smoothest and features some effort, though it also makes PERSON' pitches tougher to pick up and doesn't prevent him from throwing strikes. He doesn't miss a lot of bats and his velocity tails off in the later innings, so he might be better suited for middle relief than for the back of a rotation. He lacks the dynamic breaking ball to profile as a lefty specialist.",0
"PERSON became the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION' second straight first-round pick in NUMBER, following in the footsteps of PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION selected with the ORGANIZATION.

PERSON's deep arsenal is headlined by his heavy fastball, which sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reaches NUMBER. The pitch has excellent sink and some arm-side action, which helps PERSON to miss barrels and generate weak, ground-ball contact. His low-NUMBERs slider is his best secondary offering and helps him to miss bats, and he also demonstrates feel for both a curveball and changeup that have average potential. A good athlete who repeats his delivery with ease, PERSON also receives raves from club officials for his makeup and competitiveness on the mound.  Though he spent much of his college career in the bullpen, PERSON has all of the ingredients to become a big league starter, with a strong, projectable frame, four average-or-better pitches and feel for throwing strikes.",0
"PERSON's baseball bloodlines run deep. He's the son of four-time All-Star PERSON and the brother of ORGANIZATION farmhand PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION took NUMBERst overall back in NUMBER.

Beginning his first full season with PERSON, PERSON paced the circuit in all three triple-slash categories (.NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER) to become a ORGANIZATION All-Star Futures Game selection before moving up to Class A Advanced Dunedin. PERSON proved an advanced hitter through his amateur career, and his raw power was on display when he won the Under PERSON All-American Game home run derby in GPE. He has plus bat speed in spite of a swing that is unorthodox and has lots of moving parts, although it doesn't impede his ability to make consistently hard contact and drive the ball to all fields with power. Some mechanical tweaks may be necessary, but scouts nonetheless like his chances of becoming a plus hitter with at least average power.

Undeterred, the GPE selected him NUMBERth overall and then lured him away from what was believed to be a strong commitment to GPE with a $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER bonus, nearly twice the value for his slot. PERSON' senior year started slow as he tweaked his back and missed the beginning of the season, but he made up for the lost time by hitting .NUMBER in NUMBER games. PERSON has good bat speed and excellent raw power from the left side.

He was shelved for an extended period in NUMBER with right biceps tendinitis that limited him to just NUMBER innings in Double-A, but made up for lost time with an impressive performance in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON made his big league debut early in the NUMBER season, tossing three scoreless innings out of the bullpen to record a save. PERSON's fastball usually sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, but he can reach back for more when needed.

He also throws an effective curveball in the low NUMBERs and has feel for a mid-NUMBERs changeup, though he'll need to refine the latter to neutralize left-handed hitters. He's around the strike zone with his entire four-pitch mix.The strong and athletic PERSON has helped remake his delivery with remarkable success, but concerns likely will persist on account of his arm action and low three-quarters slot.

His low-NUMBERs slider shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch, but his changeup tends to be too firm and lacks life.Though he had trouble throwing strikes in college, PERSON has done a much better job finding the zone as a pro. If he can continue to do so and refine his secondary pitches, he'll progress as a starter. If not, he could move to the bullpen and throw even harder in shorter stints.",0
"PERSON is a nasty, two-pitch reliever whose fastball plays up because of its movement, and because PERSON is huge and generates big extension.

Though he fits best in right field with his strong arm, PERSON presumably will have to compete with right-handed-hitting corner outfielders PERSON, PERSON and PERSON for playing time in GPE next season.",1
"After a dour, injured NUMBER season, PERSON had a bounce back NUMBER and hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER at Triple-A. He spent the offseason adding mass to his little frame, a body scouts have long been skeptical about being able to weather the full-season storm of catching. These doubts have been reinforced by PERSON' semi-frequent injury issues, which led him to focus on weight gain during the offseason. 
His athletic capabilities are clear though, and PERSON is a good ball blocker, an excellent catch-and-throw guy, and his passable framing may benefit from altering the depth at which he sets up. From a skills standpoint, totally ignoring the issue of durability, he looks like a potential everyday catcher. There has been some industry sentiment that PERSON would be best deployed as a multi-positional bat, perhaps playing third base and the outfield corners as well as catcher. He hasn't played other positions in games but has worked with <a href='https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/astros/article/Garrett-PERSON-feeds-ambition-of-catching-for-NUMBER.php'>PERSON at third</a> during the offseason, so perhaps he will be allowed to try new things once the season starts.

His go-to breaking ball is a hard curveball, though his slider reaches the mid-NUMBERs and could become equally effective if he throws it more. He also has some feel for a changeup.PERSON has a fearless approach and has cleaned up his delivery, though he'll have to continue to refine his control and command. He has the stuff to be a mid-rotation starter, but if he doesn't throw more strikes, he might become a late-inning reliever.",1
"Pitchers who are under-sized right-handers with unusual deliveries will likely be compared to PERSON in perpetuity. It might fit for PERSON, who was able to pitch at two levels, reaching Double-A in NUMBER at age NUMBER. PERSON has an exciting repertoire, with the chance to have four pitches (or more) at his disposal. His fastball can be a plus, thrown up to NUMBER mph with an ability to maintain velocity deep into starts. His tight downer curve should be at least above average, he likes to mix in a very effective cutter, and he'll show a decent slider now and again as well as a solid changeup. He has the kind of attitude you like to see on the mound, the type who likes to prove doubters wrong. He should be ready to show them as a No. NUMBER type starter in the big leagues in the next year or so.",0
"GPE's gaudy numbers in two seasons at FACILITY A&M JC attracted the attention of the ORGANIZATION, who signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER. He had modest success in his first two years as a pro before batting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER and leading the Minors in on-base percentage in NUMBER (among full-season players). While spending the first three months of the season at high Class A Lancaster and in the GPE League certainly gave him a boost, his performance actually improved slightly when he made the jump to Double-A for the final six weeks.GPE has a nice approach at the plate, managing the strike zone well and using the entire field. Because he's not a big guy, there are some concerns about how much his power will play at higher levels, though he did show a knack for driving the ball to all fields in NUMBER. While he'll be more of an on-base guy than a slugger, he should produce NUMBER-NUMBER homers per year.A plus runner, GPE makes the most out of his speed on the bases and in the outfield. He spent most of his first two pro seasons in right field, then saw more action in center field in NUMBER. He has an average arm and can handle all three outfield spots.",0
"PERSON was a star at GPE State and a mainstay on the ORGANIZATION USA collegiate national team. PERSON doubted he'd stay at shortstop and were worried he wouldn't have enough power to play second base, which is largely why PERSON fell to the third round of his draft despite three years of strong performance. 
He's hit for more power in pro ball than he ever did in college, probably because GPE's marine layer makes it more difficult to hit for power there, and also because the ORGANIZATION affiliates are all launching pads. It's hard to conclude that PERSON's minor league power output (.NUMBER ORGANIZATION, mostly via doubles and triples) won't continue because his future home is going to be PERSON. He has also stolen way more bases as a pro than he did in college, peaking with NUMBER steals in NUMBER, and NUMBER last year. ORGANIZATION prospects are encouraged to run, but PERSON is indeed a NUMBER runner and will add value on big league basepaths. Though it's unclear what the ORGANIZATION will do about the PERSON Desmond-Ryan McMahon logjam that spills over into second base, not to mention PERSON' recent call-up, PERSON seems like a good bet to be a solid everyday player for someone.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION and PERSON weren't the only pitchers who drew scouts to the ORGANIZATION in GPE, Fla., last spring. While the two aforementioned hurlers pitched for ORGANIZATION's post-graduate program, PERSON emerged as a star for the high school squad. But signability concerns caused him to fall to the eighth round of the NUMBER Draft, where the ORGANIZATION were able to lure him away from a GPE commitment with a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus. He was excellent in his abbreviated pro debut, and then was shipped off to the ORGANIZATION as part of the ORGANIZATION trade in November. In NUMBER, PERSON had continued to make strides during full-season debut with PERSON before landing on the disabled list in early June with left elbow soreness.PERSON's prospect stock took off last spring behind an uptick in velocity that pushed his formerly below-average fastball into the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. His heater has good life, too, which makes it difficult for opponents to barrel. PERSON's arsenal of secondary pitches is equally impressive, as his slider, curveball and changeup all have the potential to be average or better once fully developed.PERSON's advanced feel for pitching made for an easy transition to the professional ranks, and he showed the ability to throw each of his four pitches for strikes in his debut. PERSON may not have the ceiling of some of the other young pitchers in the ORGANIZATION' system, but, with his pitchability and strong command profile, he could be the first to reach the ORGANIZATION.",0
"In many ways, PERSON did just what was hoped in his first full season as an advanced college bat taken in the first round. Though it was done in the hitting-friendly GPE, the fact the son of ORGANIZATION minor league manager PERSON led the Minors in ORGANIZATION while topping the ORGANIZATION system in homers, ORGANIZATION and slugging percentage is even more impressive considering he hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER in the season's opening month. For a guy with this kind of power, he doesn't strike out very much, though he doesn't walk much either, something that he'll need to improve as he advances through the system. As a below-average runner who is just adequate defensively, he'll have to show he can make adjustments at the plate because it will be his bat that will carry him to the big leagues.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON PERSON got most of the buzz as the toolsiest high school outfielder in the NUMBER Draft class, but PERSON wasn't far behind. The GPE prepster, who starred for ORGANIZATION on numerous occasions, has excellent bat speed and can drive the ball to all fields. While he's not the biggest guy on the field, he has surprising pop and should grow into decent power down the road. PERSON is an excellent defensive center fielder with good range and a strong arm. Beyond his physical skills, PERSON's top tools are his instincts and his makeup, both of which are off the charts and allow his already-impressive abilities to play up even more.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"The ORGANIZATION eased PERSON into pro ball after signing him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as a NUMBER second-rounder, not allowing him to work more than five innings in a game until August of the following year. The approach paid off, as he led the high Class A GPE League in innings (NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER) and strikeouts (NUMBER) in NUMBER and topped the Double-A PERSON in the same categories (NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER, NUMBER) last year while ranking as the youngest ORGANIZATION qualifier (ages NUMBER and NUMBER) in each circuit. He has gotten hammered in his return to Double-A this year, however.PERSON's fastball sat around NUMBER mph in high school but now runs from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with arm-side run and sink that should help him deal with PERSON. When he doesn't get around his low-NUMBERs slider, he shows the ability to throw it for strikes and to back-foot it against left-handers. His fading changeup slipped a little in NUMBER but can be a solid pitch when he maintains his arm speed and slot when he throws it.Colorado officials compare his less-than-smooth mechanics to PERSON's, and like the three-time Cy Young Award winner in his younger days, PERSON's biggest need is consistent command. He had repeated his delivery well and thrown strikes in the past, but inconsistency with his mechanics has led to his struggles in NUMBER. He's still just NUMBER, so he has plenty of time to turn things around.",0
"In NUMBER, Harvard-Westlake High School in LOCATION had two first-round pitchers in GPE Fried and PERSON. PERSON, a two-way player in high school, became pitcher No. NUMBER to go in the first round two years later and would have finished ninth in the ORGANIZATION in ORGANIZATION during his full-season debut had he thrown enough innings to qualify. PERSON provides the ORGANIZATION an intriguing combination of pitchability and upside. He's more polished than you'd think for a former two-way player and right now is more of a feel to pitch starter than a pure stuff guy. But there might be more to come. His fastball is average to a tick above velocity-wise and he could add some miles per hour as he matures. His changeup is his best pitch and he's not afraid to use it, maintaining his arm speed and throwing it with good deception. He throws both a slider and a curve, with the former better than the latter, though they sometimes blend together.There's a chance PERSON will have three or four average or above-average pitches at his disposal. At the very least, he's a solid No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter, but it would be a mistake to ignore his ceiling.",1
"PERSON's center-field profile and a strong summer in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER positioned him to go in the top three rounds of the NUMBER Draft. But a ball tipped off his glove and broke three bones in his face right before his junior season at GPE, and he didn't hit as well as he had as a sophomore. That allowed the ORGANIZATION to grab him in the sixth round and sign him for $NUMBER,NUMBER.PERSON's best tool is his speed, which some evaluators grade as a NUMBER on the NUMBER-NUMBER scouting scale. It makes him an obvious basestealing threat, though he doesn't swipe as many bags or succeed on as many attempts as his quickness should allow. His speed gives him plenty of range in center field and his arm is playable there.Though his wheels could translate into on-base ability at the top of a lineup, PERSON still is seeking his identity at the plate. He displayed some intriguing pull power when he ranked fifth in the Cape with five homers and went deep six times in his first two weeks as a pro. He sometimes gets caught in between the two approaches and swings and misses more than he should, though scouts praise his makeup and think he could be better in pro ball than he was in college.",0

PERSON was the third taken from the school and the ORGANIZATION went above pick value to sign him away from heading to LSU.PERSON had redshirted his sophomore year following an injury at GPE, but transferred to GPE when he was told he would be a part-timer. He more than proved he deserved to be a full-time Division I player, showing that he is a very tough out with the chance to hit for average and power. He's at least a solid-average runner, one who is better underway. He's an aggressive baserunner, taking extra bases and showing a willingness to steal a bag. He has good hands and has a strong arm from the hot corner.Defensively, PERSON has the chance to stick at third long-term. His athleticism plays well there and he shows good hands and a strong arm.

He's held his own at every step and is now handling the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' system.PERSON actually finished the NUMBER season in Double-A and played in the LOCATION playoffs after the ORGANIZATION jumped him over low Class A ball to the Class A Advanced PERSON for his full-season debut. He's continued to employ a contact-oriented approach at the plate, with some ability to hit the gaps for extra bases. Extremely athletic with a projectable frame, there's still strength PERSON can add, which should allow him to drive the ball more, with some home run pop to come. He has outstanding speed, hands, footwork and a very strong arm, everything he needs to stay at shortstop long term.Those who see PERSON as a future second baseman likely view PERSON as the ORGANIZATION' shortstop of the future. He could be more than ready to take over full time right when free-agent acquisition PERSON's contract is up.",1
"GPE's older brother PERSON went fifth overall in the NUMBER Draft and reached Double-A in his first full pro season. PERSON won't go quite that high but looks like a first-rounder and also could move quickly through the ORGANIZATION.

He has a sweet left-handed stroke, and he manages the strike zone and recognizes pitches well. His body has enough strength and leverage to possibly produce plus power if he were to add some loft to his swing, though he's content to spray line drives all over the field for now.He enhances his solid speed with keen instincts, which make him an asset on the basepaths and in the outfield.

"After the ORGANIZATION blew past their international bonus pool and spent $NUMBER.NUMBER million in NUMBER-NUMBER -- and landing elite prospects PERSON and PERSON in the process -- baseball rules prohibited them from spending more than $NUMBER,NUMBER on an individual player in the next signing period.

He had no trouble making the jump to low Class A at age NUMBER last year, batting .NUMBER while playing steady defense at second base, though shoulder soreness has hampered him in NUMBER.GPE's hands work at the plate and in the field as well as those of any ORGANIZATION prospect. With his hand-eye coordination and easy left-handed swing, he repeatedly strokes line drives from gap to gap. He's not physical and won't hit for a lot of power, though he does have some sneaky pop to his pull side.GPE profiles best at second base, where he has exceptional polish for a teenager. He has enough arm strength for third base, where GPE plans on giving him some exposure in NUMBER, and could make for an intriguing catcher. The one aspect of his game that needs refinement is his baserunning, as he has fringy speed and got caught on NUMBER of his NUMBER steal attempts a year ago.",0
"Not every successful international signing has to be a big-ticket expenditure. If the early returns are any indication, PERSON, who signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER in September NUMBER out of GPE, will be one of those bargain finds. He hit his way out of the ORGANIZATION to make his GPE debut in his first summer, then took another big step forward in the Rookie-level PERSON in NUMBER.Gains in strength led to an uptick in power, and the D-backs think PERSON has a lot more growing to do. With increased power comes increased responsibility to understand the strike zone. PERSON's strikeout rate went up in NUMBER and he didn't draw as many walks as he was too aggressive, attacking early in the count at times. As he progresses, the right-handed hitter will have to learn to lay off the steady diet of breaking stuff he's sure to get from right-handed pitching. PERSON selectivity should lead to even more in-game power. PERSON runs very well and can steal a base as well as cover ground in center field, where the D-backs think he could stay for a while.Even if he outgrows the position and has to move to a corner, he could have the offensive profile to be a regular as a five-tool right fielder. The D-backs don't have to worry about that decision yet, instead focusing on getting PERSON at-bats and watching the return on the investment grow.",0
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER, PERSON wasn't viewed as much of a prospect early in his career, as he spent four seasons between the ORGANIZATION and PERSON levels before reaching full-season ball in NUMBER. But he broke out that year with PERSON, earning PERSON of the Year honors within the organization, and then took home the award once again in NUMBER while finishing the year in Double-A. After the season, the ORGANIZATION added PERSON to their NUMBER-man roster.PERSON stands out most for his natural hitting ability, as he's an advanced left-handed hitter with a mature approach and a clean, repeatable swing that generates hard contact from line to line. He has good pop, too, albeit mostly to the gaps, and had NUMBER of his NUMBER hits go for extra bases in NUMBER, including NUMBER doubles and NUMBER home runs.PERSON' below-average speed limits him to first base, though he is a solid defender there.

"An NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON overcame those humble Draft roots to win three ORGANIZATION, make an All-Star team and hit four homers in a big league game. His son won't have to wait nearly as long to hear his name called in NUMBER.One of just three players ever selected to play in two Under PERSON All-America Games, PERSON emerged as a potential No. NUMBER overall pick as a sophomore. While his upside has leveled off a bit since then, he still profiles as a center fielder who could have at least solid tools across the board. In addition to his physical ability, he shows fine instincts in all phases of the game.PERSON should have at least average big league power, but he doesn't worry about home runs at this point. The ORGANIZATION State recruit laces line drives all over the field with a short right-handed swing and plenty of bat speed. While he's not a blazer, he can steal a few bases and chases down balls in the gaps.",0
"PERSON spent most of NUMBER on the shelf due to PERSON, and the little bit of NUMBER for which he was healthy he spent in a well-manicured relief role. Then he broke out in NUMBER, as he retained big stuff through a move back to the rotation. He was holding a tailing NUMBER-NUMBER deep into starts, topping out at NUMBER, and spinning in a dastardly, bat-missing breaking ball. Unrefined fastball control led to a lot of bullpen projection, but PERSON hadn't pitched very much because of injury, so it seemed possible that it might yet improve. 
Early in NUMBER, PERSON's stuff was down a bit, more NUMBER-NUMBER and touching NUMBER, before he got popped for ORGANIZATION and was suspended for NUMBER games. He returned with the same heater, peaking at NUMBER, and the changeup got better very quickly. The command piece is still not always there, particularly early in games, but at other times PERSON has arm-side feel for the change, glove-side feel for his slider, and and he'll run the occasional two-seamer back over the plate. It's top NUMBER stuff with the suspension and injury history rounding the ORGANIZATION down just a bit.",0
"PERSON was in the midst of breakout season in NUMBER when he received a NUMBER-game suspension after testing positive for amphetamines. He came back to perform well in the ORGANIZATION and the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the trade that sent PERSON and ORGANIZATION to the A's in January. He was on the move again in November, heading to ORGANIZATION in a six-player deal that sent big leaguers PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to PERSON. In June, PERSON received another suspension, this time for NUMBER games, after he tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance. PERSON draws praise for his all-out playing style as well as his ability to play bigger than his size and his tools, though that's not to say he doesn't have physical ability. He has above-average speed and defensive chops in center field, though he saw time in all three outfield spots in NUMBER. PERSON sees a lot of pitches and knows how to work counts, which has helped him accrue nearly as many walks as strikeouts in his career. He doesn't hit for much power, save for some doubles and triples, but the bat-to-ball skills are advanced and yield hard contact across the entire field. PERSON has a chance to develop into a big league regular, perhaps even a No. NUMBER type catalyst in the lineup, but if not, he still has a high floor as a fourth outfielder.",1

PERSON played the outfield, third base and second base during his time with the ORGANIZATION, though he focused on the infield during his pro debut.PERSON has shown signs of being able to hit for both average and power, with the ability to add strength a plus for future development at the plate. PERSON could be an intriguing offensive-minded second baseman, but if the bat comes along as some hope, he might profile better back at the hot corner.

"PERSON stood out as a prep sophomore for his big raw power and arm strength, both as a catcher and a pitcher in the low-NUMBERs on the mound. He peaked early in that regard, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER late in the NUMBER draft when his catching and hitting didn't progress and he was mostly just a mid-NUMBERs arm that occasionally showed command or a breaking ball. That projection has mostly held, as three years later PERSON has reached Double-A as a short reliever, but his breaking ball is consistently average to above and his command has improved, so there's a clear path to becoming a middle reliever. The ORGANIZATION acquired him in late NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION deal with GPE.",0
"One of several bargains signed by PERSON assistant GM for international operations PERSON and his staff, PERSON turned pro for a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. He pitched in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON at age NUMBER and made his big league debut in a relief role last September at age NUMBER.PERSON has one of the best changeups in the Minors, and its combination of deception and sink earns plus-plus grades from some evaluators. He sets it up with a running fastball that usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and climbs as high as NUMBER in short stints. His curveball used to be a weakness but he has added depth to it and it's usually an average pitch.Similar to PERSON at the same stage of their careers, PERSON has a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and a good chance to become at least a late-inning reliever. To stay in the rotation, he'll need to resist the temptation to overthrow his fastball (which causes it to straighten out) and to fall in love with his changeup (which leads him to drop his arm slot and turn his curve into a slurve). He also needs to refine his ability to control and command his pitches, which has diminished as he has risen through the Minors.",1
"The ORGANIZATION gave PERSON an over-slot bonus as a fifth-round pick in NUMBER because they saw his upside as a tall, gangly right-hander from GPE. So far, they've seemed prescient, as PERSON grew a bit more, started filling out and added a lot of velocity, all while evolving into a more complete pitcher. Only a sprained ankle that forced him to the disabled list in May has slowed down his progress. PERSON has the ability to blow away hitters on a consistent basis, proof of which comes in the form of his robust strikeout-per-nine-inning career ratio. He does so with a fastball he can consistently get up into the upper NUMBERs, maintaining that plus velocity throughout his starts. He's capable of throwing a plus curve, though not always consistently, and he's worked on throwing it earlier in counts to keep hitters guessing more. His changeup has improved as well, giving him a third pitch that can be at least PERSON average. Especially for his size, PERSON repeats his delivery fairly well, and his overall command is improving. Despite the ankle injury, PERSON has shown he can handle the challenge of Double-A.

"One of the least experienced and more polarizing college pitchers available in the NUMBER draft, PERSON has an electric, four-pitch mix and several developmental hurdles ahead of him. At a skinny NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, there are scouts who doubt he can start based solely on his frame, though PERSON held mid-NUMBERs velocity deep into games as a junior at ORGANIZATION. If amateur scouts are to be believed, any of the following aspects of PERSON's current profile could change: his stride direction, his arm slot, his breaking ball usage (he has two that bleed together), and the movement profile of his fastball. PERSON was academically ineligible as a sophomore and only started NUMBER games in three years of college, so there's at least a reason he's behind his peers from a developmental standpoint. He has unteachable arm speed and feel for spin and even if he just ends up as a big league reliever, something that seems pretty reasonable given his talent, it would be a strong outcome for a third round pick. Like GPE, PERSON may move up this list quickly with refinement, but we'd like to see it fairly soon given his age.",0
"PERSON struggled at ORGANIZATION A Advanced St. Lucie in his first full professional season after the ORGANIZATION took him in the second round in NUMBER. But he fared much better when he moved up to Double-A Binghamton in NUMBER, eventually earning a promotion to Triple-A Las Vegas.  PERSON has found the short, line-drive stroke that made him so successful at the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION. He has a gap-to-gap approach and has a good feel for hitting, though he doesn't produce much power. He isn't much of a speedster either, typically grading out as a below-average runner.  Due to his lack of speed, PERSON faces questions about his ability to remain at shortstop. He has soft hands and a strong arm and would be a solid defender at second or third base if he does have to move. But his bat profiles best at shortstop and the ORGANIZATION have been encouraged by his progress at the position.",0
"If it hadn't been for some struggles in Triple-A and then injuries that shelved him for more than a month, ORGANIZATION likely would have seen some time in GPE in NUMBER.

He'll throw his power sinking fastball up to NUMBER mph and back it up with a hard slider that has cutter-like action. He'll mix in an occasional changeup for a different look, though it's not really an effective part of his arsenal.

"PERSON was a solid high school prospect from LOCATION, and the first player ever drafted out of GPE High School when the ORGANIZATION took him in the NUMBERnd round of the NUMBER ORGANIZATION. After two fairly nondescript seasons at ORGANIZATION, PERSON put his name on the map with a big ORGANIZATION PERSON last summer and has kept raking in his junior year, raising his ORGANIZATION profile considerably.PERSON has made many adjustments at the plate which have led to his prolonged success in the ORGANIZATION and back in the PAC-NUMBER this summer. PERSON always thought he had raw power, and he's finally learning to turn on the ball and pull it, showing the pop needed for his profile. He'll need to hit because as a below-average runner and below-average defender, he is likely limited to first base, with an outside shot of being able to handle left field.In either case, his bat will have to play in order for him to advance. The good news is that as the ORGANIZATION approached, it looked like it might, with PERSON looking like the kind of college performer who could come off the board in the top three rounds.",0
"The ORGANIZATION used their third- and fourth-round picks in the NUMBER Draft on offensive-minded college infielders coming off surgery to repair the labrums in their throwing shoulders. Though PERSON went around ahead of him, PERSON is the better prospect because he's the superior defender and has a chance to play shortstop.That said, PERSON's bat is still his carrying tool. He drills line drives to all fields and exhibits extreme patience from both sides of the plate. He has some wiry strength too, though it has yet to translate into much power.After offseason surgery, PERSON spent much of the college season at ORGANIZATION and played a few games at second base. Before he hurt his shoulder, he showed average arm strength and decent range at shortstop but also was erratic. He has average speed and uses it well on the bases.",0
"When PERSON, a NUMBER second-round pick of the ORGANIZATION from the ORGANIZATION Panhandle high school ranks, has been on the field, he's shown the ability to be a dynamic catalyst. A variety of injuries, however, has made that difficult, hampering his development.Over the past three seasons, the speedster has suffered a broken wrist, a ruptured PERSON, a torn hip flexor, and, most recently, an oblique injury, keeping him from topping the NUMBER-game mark in any one regular season. Despite that, PERSON has reached the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' system. Before the last injury, he was making excellent adjustments in Double-A, showing an ability to hit for average from both sides of the plate. He remains one of the fastest players in the ORGANIZATION, one who is a major basestealing threat. PERSON moved from shortstop to center field in NUMBER, where his top-of-the-line speed plays very well. He's improved his routes and jumps as well, projecting as an above-average defender with a solid arm.A full, healthy season is the most important thing for PERSON at this point. That should help him develop into an athletic leadoff hitter who will wreak havoc on the basepaths in GSP.",1

The right-hander began the NUMBER season as an unknown NUMBER-year-old reliever in the ORGANIZATION State League, but finished it in Triple-A, knocking on the big league door.PERSON has the stuff to succeed in a Major League bullpen. He'll throw his fastball in the mid-NUMBERs and can reach back on occasion for more. He has two usable secondary offerings in his slider and changeup, both of which will actually flash above-average at times. Consistency is still the key for PERSON, who has only pitched in the GPE for two seasons. He does tend to throw a lot of strikes and can generate ground-ball outs, something the ORGANIZATION covet.While PERSON might have the repertoire to start, his age and his lack of physicality led to the ORGANIZATION keeping him in the bullpen. It seems to have been a wise move as he's been able to ascent rapidly and is just about ready to contribute in a middle relief type role.",0
"PERSON was a standout early in his high school career with a body that looked like present day PERSON, but he's slimmed up, improved as a receiver and still has an impact bat.",0
"PERSON does a little bit of everything and projects to stay at shortstop while providing modest offensive output. His arm strength has returned to something more closely resembling its pre-injury (labrum) form, bolstering confidence in his abiity to stay at short. Offensively, PERSON is patient and has a contact-first approach, but there's enough thunder in his hands and wrists to do some extra-base damage and a chance he grows into more as he ages. He's a near-ready everyday shortstop.",0
"Originally signed out of GPE in NUMBER when he was NUMBER years old, PERSON has quickly risen through the ranks of ORGANIZATION prospects, and he stands out for his above-average speed.Thanks to his quickness, PERSON has excellent range. Along with his soft hands and good infield actions, he has all the tools to be an above-average defender. PERSON knows how to use his speed to his advantage on offense, as well. His speed allows him to beat out infield hits and makes him a basestealing threat. PERSON's swing is contact oriented, producing only minimal power.After making significant improvements in NUMBER, PERSON has begun moving through the ORGANIZATION faster, reaching Double-A Mississippi as a NUMBER-year old. He profiles as a top-of-the-order hitter.",1
"Arguably the best pitcher available in the NUMBER Draft, GPE rarely has been healthy since signing for $NUMBER million as the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. The ORGANIZATION expected him to reach the big leagues within two years, but elbow, biceps, lat and shoulder injuries restricted him to NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in his first five pro seasons. He worked just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER in NUMBER before undergoing thoracic outlet surgery that left PERSON guardedly optimistic about his future.Before he got hurt, GPE could showcase frontline-starter stuff with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that reached triple digits, a hammer curveball and flashes of a solid slider and changeup. In NUMBER, he has pitched more at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his heater and his breaking pitches have yet to regain their former power as well. He opened the year as a starter but came down with shoulder soreness after three outings, and he headed to the bullpen after spending another two months on the disabled list.Originally recruited by the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a third baseman, GPE is a fine athlete who has no trouble repeating his mechanics and delivering strikes. If he has to remain a reliever, he could offer closer upside if he regains his former stuff. His younger brother PERSON was also a first-round pick (NUMBER, GPE) and made his big league debut in NUMBER.",0
"A two-way player at GPE (Mo.) JC, PERSON went to the Twins in the NUMBERst round of the NUMBER Draft as a left-handed pitcher but turned them down to transfer to PERSON. After performing much better at the plate than on the mound with the Shockers, he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER when the ORGANIZATION selected him in the NUMBERth round as an outfielder in NUMBER. He led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with NUMBER RBIs during his first full pro season while showing better power and speed than he did as an amateur.PERSON's left-handed raw power, speed and arm strength all grade as plus tools. His NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame creates impressive leverage that he could utilize better by adding more loft to his swing. His extra-large frame comes with a naturally long swing, and he needs a more consistent approach after striking out in NUMBER percent of his plate appearances during his first two pro seasons.PERSON is surprisingly fast for a big man and has NUMBER-NUMBER potential. He runs well enough to cover ground in center field but fits better on the corners. His arm, which provided NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastballs in college, works anywhere in the outfield.",0
"Trading PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in December NUMBER has worked out well for the A's, who received PERSON, corner-infield prospect PERSON and PERSON in return. PERSON had a rough first season in his new organization, but he bounced back in NUMBER to assert himself as the system's top pitching prospect. Unfortunately, PERSON injured his elbow in the spring of NUMBER and he had PERSON surgery in May.When healthy, PERSON usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball, and he can reach NUMBER mph. PERSON has done a fine job of refining his changeup in his two years in GPE's system, to the point where it now ranks as his second-best pitch. His hard slider can also be a weapon at times, albeit with less consistency.Scouts who saw PERSON in low Class A in NUMBER and 'NUMBER noted his improved mound presence the second time around, as he learned to trust his stuff and attack hitters. His control and command took a step forward, and if PERSON continues to improve, he could be a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter.",0
"PERSON has teamed up with first baseman PERSON in full-season ball to form a powerful infield duo. With PERSON in NUMBER, PERSON hit NUMBER home runs and PERSON added NUMBER. Their combined total of NUMBER homers was the most by a pair of teammates in the ORGANIZATION. Thanks to the bat speed PERSON produces, he has significant raw power and is capable of driving the ball out to all fields. Like many young hitters, his approach is a bit inconsistent, and he can get caught up trying to pull everything. But when he's at his best, he uses the whole field to hit and does a good job of hunting fastballs he can drive. Defensively, PERSON remains a work in progress. He's shown signs he's getting better and dramatically cut down on his errors in NUMBER. The A's began playing him some at first base for the first time in NUMBER.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft, they did so based on the merits of his left-handed bat. The ORGANIZATION product showcased his impressive hitting ability during his pro debut, when he hit .NUMBER and paced Rookie-level Princeton in homers (NUMBER), ORGANIZATION (NUMBER) and doubles (NUMBER). However, it wasn't until the ORGANIZATION moved him from third base to catcher ahead of the NUMBER season that his prospect stock truly gained traction. In his first season behind the plate, PERSON was named a mid-season All-Star for Class A Bowling Green.PERSON's calling card is his left-handed power, which has produced double-digit home runs and NUMBER-plus doubles in each of his first two pro campaigns. He also has good feel to hit and knows how to use the entire field, though he hits the ball on the ground a bit too often. PERSON's speed is well above average relative to his position and could make him a threat to record double-digit steals in a given season.A shortstop at ORGANIZATION, PERSON spent his entire pro debut at the hot corner before the ORGANIZATION asked him to give catching a try. ORGANIZATION officials speak highly of his makeup as well as the work ethic he's shown while making the transition. His athleticism and strong arm currently are his best assets and give him the potential to develop into a quality catch-and-throw backstop. His receiving and blocking, on the other hand, require further refinement.",0
"PERSON merited a top-three-rounds pick coming out of high school but he dropped to the Rockies in the NUMBERnd round because he wanted to attend PERSON. After missing all of NUMBER with a sprained elbow ligament that didn't require surgery, he pitched the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION World Series semifinals by tossing NUMBER straight shutout innings in the ORGANIZATION tournament and was named Big NUMBER Conference pitcher of the year. Because he ranked third in Division I with NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings, the ORGANIZATION shut him down for the summer after signing him for $NUMBER,NUMBER as their top pick (third round).PERSON's PERSON, one of the best pitching coaches in college baseball, had PERSON drop to a low three-quarters arm angle as a redshirt sophomore, a move that improved the life on his pitches. He has a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that reaches NUMBER and creates a lot of groundouts with its run and sink. His new arm slot is conducive to throwing a slider, and he flashes a plus one in the low NUMBERs that he can locate on either side of the plate.PERSON's third pitch is an average changeup that he'll need to use more in pro ball. While he's not big for a starter, he maintains his velocity into the late innings and throws strikes, so he should be able to stay in the rotation. The ORGANIZATION love his makeup and the way he attacks hitters.",0
"PERSON was one of the biggest surprises in the first round of the NUMBER Draft, generating little pre-Draft buzz for someone who would go NUMBERth overall. But after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER, he showed everyone what the ORGANIZATION saw in him. PERSON won ORGANIZATION honors in the ORGANIZATION after leading the ORGANIZATION circuit in runs (NUMBER), doubles (NUMBER), extra-base hits (NUMBER), ORGANIZATION (NUMBER), slugging percentage (.NUMBER) and ORGANIZATION (.NUMBER).PERSON found the going tougher in NUMBER, struggling mightily at low Class A ORGANIZATION, before spraining his left thumb and getting sent to Short-Season Salem-Keizer upon his return. His pure hitting ability and bat speed were more apparent after his demotion. As he gets stronger, PERSON could grow into average power.Because PERSON is just an average runner and athlete, some scouts question how long he can stay at shortstop. But he has solid arm strength and PERSON's brass thinks he has more quick-twitch ability than he gets credit for. PERSON played mostly second base at ORGANIZATION but returned to shortstop at Salem-Keizer.",0
"One of the more high-profile GPE players to hit the market in recent years, PERSON was declared a free agent on Jan. NUMBER and was expected to make a decision on where he was going to sign on Feb. NUMBER. However, things took a turn when his agency, Culture NUMBER, refused to represent him after allegedly receiving a death threat. After seeking out new representation, the NUMBER-year-old outfielder signed with GPE for $NUMBER million at the start of the NUMBER-NUMBER international period. Ranked No. NUMBER on MLB.com's list of the Top NUMBER international prospects, PERSON is a dynamic talent who stands out for his power, speed and overall athleticism. Though his bat speed is undeniable, his uppercut bat path through the zone, as well as a few holes in his approach, will need to be ironed out in the professional ranks. He's capable of playing either center or right field, with the necessary athleticism and arm strength for either position. On defense, PERSON likely will be given every chance to prove he can stick in center field, though some scouts already wonder whether he fits better at a corner outfield spot given his overall skill set.",0
"Heading into the NUMBER season, PERSON was a late-round (NUMBERth) college arm out of ORGANIZATION State Bernardino who was struggling to gain traction after being taken in the NUMBER Draft. After a first full season that saw him throw just NUMBER innings and included multiple trips to the disabled list, the NUMBER-foot-NUMBER right-hander committed himself to conditioning and opened the NUMBER season in tremendous shape. It paid off, as he reached Double-A, threw more than NUMBER innings and led the organization in ERA.PERSON' stuff is largely average across the board, and it plays up because of movement and command. He'll throw his fastball in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range that has very good carry, enabling him to get swings and misses up in the zone along with weak fly balls and popups. He has a solid downer curve ball that he pairs effectively with his heater, then can mix in an average slider and a developing changeup. Thanks to his conditioning, he repeated his delivery much more consistently and has developed into the kind of pitcher who fills up the strike zone with ease.PERSON took a huge step forward in NUMBER, leaving the organization excited for what he might do for an encore. His ceiling might be limited to a career as a back-end starting pitcher, but he now appears not far from reaching that potential.",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in NUMBER as a college reliever who could potentially get to the big leagues fairly quickly, and a debut assignment to full season ball shows they think the ORGANIZATION product can handle it. PERSON certainly has the stuff and mentality to pitch in short relief. His fastball will climb up to NUMBER mph and sit at NUMBER mph consistently. He does throw a slider, though it's not a consistently effective pitch, and he's shown a fairly deceptive changeup. He gets a good amount of swings and misses, though he'll have to refine his command and sharpen the breaking ball if he wants to close games in the future. If not, he still could be an extremely effective setup man in the near future for the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON has missed all of NUMBER with a stress fracture in his back. When healthy last year he was NUMBER-NUMBER with a potential plus changeup and future average curveball. He's a draft eligible sophomore and we know even less about PERSON than other eligible sophs because he missed much of his senior year with various ailments, too.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION traded PERSON to the ORGANIZATION at the NUMBER PERSON, they collected a trio of interesting relief prospects in GPE, PERSON and PERSON. None of them throw harder than PERSON, whose pro debut was delayed because of a positive steroid test and who was moved from starting to relief work in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION liked his arm strength enough to add him to the NUMBER-man roster following the NUMBER season to protect him from being selected in the Rule NUMBER Draft. He made his big league debut in April NUMBER but spent much of the season in Triple-A before going to the Mariners with PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON for PERSON and PERSON in early December. PERSON has top-of-the-scale velocity with his fastball, a heater that sits NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches triple digits with plus life to it. He doesn't always have a feel for where it's going, however, walking NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings in NUMBER. His slider will flash plus, but is also inconsistent, and he will need to land it for strikes to keep progressing. He also has an interesting changeup that could help him, especially against left-handed hitters, if he commits to throwing it.Right now, PERSON is all about premium velocity and projection. If he can find the strike zone more and refine his breaking ball, he has the chance to pitch in the back end of a big league bullpen.",1
"Heading into the NUMBER GPE class, there were catchers who had better offensive profiles, and there were backstops who were better defensively, but no one seemed to have a better chance of being a solid all-around big league catcher than GPE. The ORGANIZATION product went in the second round as a result, then saw his prospect stock plummet with a dreadful first full season in NUMBER and he was not able to bounce back offensively in NUMBER as an injury to his other wrist delayed his start and clearly impacted his production.A natural leader who prides himself on being tough behind the plate, it turned out GPE had hid a right hand and wrist injury from the organization, self-treating it at night and playing through it. It clearly impacted his hitting as he batted only .NUMBER and slugged .NUMBER, but he hasn't been able to get back to being the average hitter that he was pre-injury, one with some power to tap into. While he hasn't handled the bat, GPE has impressed the organization with his defensive play. He's great working with pitchers, calling a good game to go along with solid blocking and receiving skills. His throwing has improved, and he'd thrown out just over NUMBER percent of potential base stealers in his career heading into NUMBER.GPE deserves some slack because of the injuries, but he does have to show he can stay healthy and be productive at the plate. If he can do that, he could shoot back up this list and reclaim his mantel as one of the best overall catching prospect from his GPE class.",0
"PERSON's ORGANIZATION stock steadily improved during his senior year at ORGANIZATION, where he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA with a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts per nine while leading the program to a third-place finish in the NUMBER ORGANIZATION World Series. The ORGANIZATION made him their fifth-round pick that June. After two pedestrian seasons to begin his career, the right-hander broke out in NUMBER, earning All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION before a second-half promotion to Double-A. He's continued his ascent towards the Majors in NUMBER, posting strong numbers back in the LOCATION en route to a Triple-A promotion late in May.Big and physical, PERSON generates a plus fastball that sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and at times touches higher, all the while working on a downhill plane that fuels his impressive ground-ball rate. He has a pair of promising secondary pitches in a curveball and a changeup, with the latter currently grading as the better offering. Meanwhile, PERSON showed improved strike-throwing ability last season after working with the ORGANIZATION to simplify his delivery.PERSON was one the more improved players in the ORGANIZATION' system since the start of NUMBER, and they believe he has the ingredients to start at the highest level. If not, the right-hander's power arm could make him an effective late-inning reliever.",0
"GPE to sign as a NUMBER-year-old GPE in July NUMBER, PERSON had to wait more than three years before the ORGANIZATION gave him a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus in December NUMBER. He has enjoyed consistent success since turning pro, posting a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA while reaching PERSON in his first three seasons. His fastball continues to improve, repeatedly touching NUMBER mph in each of his starts during the last three months of NUMBER, maxing out at NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION liked his stuff enough to get him as part of the trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in late July. PERSON's heater sat at NUMBER-NUMBER mph during his NUMBER GPE debut and operated at NUMBER-NUMBER last year. He has life on his fastball too, though he doesn't miss as many bats as expected yet because the quality of his secondary pitches fluctuates. His upper-NUMBERs slider and low-NUMBERs curveball are more notable for their velocity than their bite and can get slurvy at times, while his changeup can get too firm. PERSON does show aptitude for making adjustments, so there is belief he can remain a starter. His control and command also need refinement, but he's making progress in both areas. If he does wind up in the bullpen, he has closer potential and could regularly hit NUMBER mph in shorter stints.",0
"One of two high school hitters the ORGANIZATION took in the first round of the NUMBER Draft, ORGANIZATION had a solid first full season, being named to the LOCATION League All-Star team and showing the kind of defensive skills that made him a first-round pick in the first place.Though he'll be just NUMBER for all of the NUMBER season, ORGANIZATION is very advanced behind the plate. He's a natural leader who works with pitchers well and already understands many of the nuances of game-calling. He has an above-average arm and gets rid of the ball quickly, which led to him throwing out NUMBER percent of basestealers in NUMBER. The left-handed hitter makes a lot of contact at the plate, using all fields well. He should add a bit more power as he matures, and he runs well for a catcher, with that athleticism helping him behind the plate.It often takes high school catchers longer to get through a Minor League system because they have so much to learn. ORGANIZATION is already way ahead of the curve. That, plus his outstanding makeup and work ethic, could allow him to move more quickly than most prep backstops.",0
"An everyday player at multiple infield positions for Michigan the last three years, GPE set a school record with NUMBER saves as a sophomore in NUMBER and has shuttled between the bullpen and rotation this spring. The burden of double duty and changing mound roles caused his stuff to fade down the stretch, but scouts would love to see what he can do when he focuses solely on pitching in pro ball.GPE has the best splitter in the GPE, and NUMBER-NUMBER mph offering that tumbles at the plate and elicits consistent swings and misses. He uses it too much, to the detriment of his fastball command. His heater ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with some run and sink, and he also has an inconsistent slider.GPE figures to get an opportunity to start as a pro but likely will be a reliever. He lacks size, has a so-so delivery and had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder following his freshman year. Part of the ORGANIZATION's national team identification program in high school, he's a good athlete and a tough competitor.",0
"GPE high school powerhouse PERSON has produced more than its fair share of prospects, the most recent being ORGANIZATION slugger PERSON. GPE doesn't have that kind of upside, but his combination of tools and makeup will have many teams interested in the top five rounds.An athletic shortstop in high school, GPE does have a pretty solid feel to hit. He makes consistent hard contact and can spray line drives to all fields. PERSON isn't a part of his game, but he has some extra-base ability. The ORGANIZATION State commit has very good speed that should allow him to be a threat on the bases as well as give him good range in the infield. He's a solid defender with an average arm, though whether he's an everyday shortstop in the future remains to be seen.All of GPE's tools play up because of his instincts, his aggressiveness and his work ethic, a combination many teams will want to add to their organization.",0
PERSON's combination of deception and an above average curveball could propel an otherwise modest repertoire into a role at the back of a rotation.,0
"GPE love PERSON's NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound frame.He's lean -- some evaluators even describe him as lanky -- and he is athletic, with room to grow. On defense, some scouts view him as the ideal center fielder because of his ability to read balls off the bat and his defensive instincts. He has also impressed evaluators with his reactions to balls hit into the gaps.In the batter's box, PERSON is a natural left-handed hitter with a fluid stroke and a good approach in games. He has also shown some power.PERSON's arm is best described as playable, and he has enough arm strength to play his primary position in center field. He does have some experience playing in the infield, particularly at second base, but his future will be in the outfield as long as he continues to develop.PERSON signed a $NUMBER million deal with the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have one of the best catchers in the big leagues in GPE and one of the top catching prospects in the Minors in GPE. Nevertheless, they couldn't resist the temptation to draft PERSON when he was available with the NUMBERnd pick in the NUMBER Draft. The ORGANIZATION USA Player of the ORGANIZATION signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million.PERSON has a mature approach, employs a short stroke and uses the entire field. He makes consistent hard contact and could provide NUMBER homers per season once he adds some more strength.PERSON's offense stands out more than his defense, though he should be able to stay behind the plate. He has an average arm but still needs to polish his receiving and blocking skills. A top student, PERSON has the work ethic to make the necessary improvements.",0
"The ORGANIZATION honed in on PERSON's defense and makeup when they made him a fifth-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON's highest choice since PERSON was a GPE third-rounder in NUMBER. His bat has been better than expected, allowing him to move quickly in the ORGANIZATION system. He reached Double-A midway through his first full pro season, and though he struggled there, he rebounded as one of the top performers in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON's biggest assets are his quick hands and his instincts, which help him at the plate and in the field. He covers ground at shortstop, has a strong arm and an internal clock that helps him play above his tools. The heir apparent to PERSON in GPE, he also has played second base in pro ball, third base in college and could handle the outfield.There's some concern about PERSON's lack of strength at the plate, though he understands his limitations and focuses on making contact and getting on base. He maintains a compact left-handed swing and controls the strike zone better than anyone in the system. He has the speed and savvy to steal NUMBER bases per season, though he was caught in NUMBER of his NUMBER attempts last year.",0
"There were high hopes for PERSON when he signed as a NUMBER-year-old out of GPE back in NUMBER for $NUMBER,NUMBER. He got off to a great start at the lower levels of ORGANIZATION's system then started running into elbow troubles, getting shut down in NUMBER and needing PERSON surgery that cost him the NUMBER season. He missed NUMBER as well when he contracted mono during rehab, finally returning and shaking off the rust the following year. He topped NUMBER innings in a season for the first time in his career in NUMBER, reaching Triple-A, pitching in the ORGANIZATION and leading the organization in strikeouts in the process.While he may no longer be the high-ceilinged potential frontline starter the ORGANIZATION hoped he might be, there is a little more certainty that he can be a big league starter now that he's put in a full, healthy season. He has a solid four-pitch mix and can fill the strike zone with all of them using a clean delivery. He commands his low-NUMBERs fastball well and he can reach back for more velocity when he needs to. He didn't have a good feel for either breaking ball at the start of NUMBER, but then got on a roll, with his curve really taking a step forward. His curve pairs nicely with his fastball to create a good two-pitch, GPE profile, and he mixes in his sinking changeup effectively as well.Those who have been with the organization since PERSON's signing breathed a huge sigh of relief after his successful NUMBER season. He might be more of a mid-to-back of the rotation starter now, but he's finally just about ready to impact the big league staff.",1
"A decorated college performer, PERSON's fastball sits NUMBER-NUMBER though he'll show you NUMBER+ on occasion. His high effort delivery limits his command projection but he has a nasty NUMBER-NUMBER curveball and might be able to pitch in the back of a bullpen if he doesn't work out as a #NUMBER starter",0
"PERSON's athleticism got him drafted in the second round by the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER but didn't translate into immediate results in pro ball. After PERSON traded him to the PERSON for PERSON in January, he struggled so much in training camp that he was held back in extended spring training to work on his delivery. He reported to low Class A Quad Cities in May and earned a promotion to high Class A Lancaster two months later. PERSON pitching coaches have helped PERSON with his mechanics, and the result is that he's throwing more strikes than ever. His slider also has improved significantly and looks like it will become at least an average pitch. PERSON's best offering is his fastball, which currently ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER to NUMBER. He's so athletic and projectable that he should add more velocity in the future. He also shows some feel for a changeup with sink and could have three average or better pitches when he's fully developed.",0
"After moving from the bullpen to the rotation in mid-NUMBER, PERSON was the best starter on loaded ORGANIZATION pitching staffs in NUMBER and 'NUMBER. He helped the ORGANIZATION win the ORGANIZATION World Series in NUMBER and finish runner-up in 'NUMBER, leading ORGANIZATION Division I with NUMBER wins and ranking second with NUMBER strikeouts in the latter season. Drafted eighth overall by the FACILITY, PERSON signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER.PERSON handled high Class A hitters easily in his pro debut and should rush through the ORGANIZATION, just as PERSON and PERSON did with GPE. PERSON can miss bats with both his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball and his power curveball. His changeup gives him at least an average third pitch, though he should throw it more often. Despite PERSON's repertoire and track record of success, some scouts believe he will wind up as a reliever because he lacks size and has a high-tempo delivery that affects his control at times. The FACILITY envision him as a potential No. NUMBER starter because he has demonstrated the ability to maintain electric stuff from start to start and deep into games. PERSON's highly competitive makeup is another asset.",1
"PERSON Los PERSON has proven the old adage of ""have arm strength, will travel"" at a young age. Signed back in July NUMBER by the Mariners at age NUMBER, he was traded to the ORGANIZATION following the NUMBER season in the ORGANIZATION deal. After pitching across two levels of A ball in his first season with his new organization, he pitched well in Double-A in NUMBER, tossing NUMBER innings and finishing fifth in the system in strikeouts. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw and were happy to add another young, intriguing arm to their deep stable of pitching prospects in the ORGANIZATION trade last PERSONcember. A dominant turn in Triple-A led to him making his big league debut in NUMBER.The right-hander is capable of using his plus fastball that sits around NUMBER-NUMBER mph and can touch as high as NUMBER-NUMBER mph to both miss bats and get weak contact, and improved command of the pitch has made it an even better weapon. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, one that flashes plus with good fade to it, but he doesn't throw his curve as effectively.Given that PERSON los PERSON shows glimpses of three at least PERSON average pitches to go along with durability, he's getting every chance to start and showing it just might come together as a No. NUMBER type starter. If the breaking ball doesn't come, that fastball-changeup combination could be nasty coming out of the pen.",1
"PERSON quietly has made progress through GPE's system since signing out of GPE at the outset of the NUMBER international period. He performed well in the ORGANIZATION and GPE summer leagues during his first two pro seasons, respectively, and continued to impress last season in the ORGANIZATION before earning PERSON all-star honors during his NUMBER full-season debut.PERSON has a quick bat from the right side of the plate, with present feel for the barrel and for using the entire field, but also an aggressive approach that leads to some swing-and-miss and will need to be toned down. Added strength to his wiry athletic frame has produced more consistent power, and scouts believe there's more to come.PERSON's plus speed is his loudest tool and enables him to make an impact on the basepaths as well as in the outfield, where he's an above-average defender capable of playing all three spots. That versatility, along with his offensive potential, could make PERSON a big league contributor, if not more.",0
"Saving money with their first two picks in the NUMBER ORGANIZATION enabled the ORGANIZATION to go slightly over pick value to sign PERSON, the top prospect from the state of GPE, away from his college commitment to GPE Carolina.PERSON, whose older brother Jon pitches in the ORGANIZATION' system, took a huge leap during his senior year to move up ORGANIZATION boards in a hurry. A spike in velocity had the right-hander throwing NUMBER-NUMBER mph, thanks to getting in much better shape. PERSON's NUMBER-to-NUMBER curveball has gotten harder and tighter as well, giving him a second potential above-average pitch. He hasn't needed it much, but he shows some aptitude for a changeup, as well.PERSON is still learning to harness his stuff, but the Bucs have shown a willingness to patiently develop young, projectable arms in the past, something they'll have to do to help PERSON reach his potential.",0
"PERSON was a two-way player at ORGANIZATION, where he had more consistent success as a first baseman/DH than he did as a starter. But scouts thought PERSON's future was brighter on the mound and that he'd fare better once he focused solely on pitching. Thus far, scouts have been correct on both counts. A sixth-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON missed the end of his first full pro season with a balky elbow. He came back healthy and threw harder than ever in NUMBER. After the season, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON. PERSON throws in the low NUMBERs, and he regularly touches NUMBER mph with his fastball. He is working on refining his secondary pitches, though his curveball and changeup show glimpses of becoming solid offerings. PERSON throws strikes, but he needs to do a better job of locating his pitches within the strike zone. He has a ceiling of a No. NUMBER starter, and he could also develop into a useful reliever.",0
"PERSON was the ace starter for one of the most prospect-laden prep teams in the country in NUMBER, PERSON, which was led by NUMBERth overall pick catcher PERSON (Reds) and center fielder PERSON (ORGANIZATION), who got a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus in the NUMBERth round. PERSON could've received a low-to-mid six figure bonus out of high school, but instead went to PERSON, where he mostly relieved, a role that agrees with his aggressive approach and standout fastball/curveball combination. PERSON's command backed up a bit in NUMBER, which is why he lasted until the fifth round despite being the sort of up-in-the-zone four-seam fastball and power curveball reliever that clubs now favor due to ORGANIZATION data. If he can dial in his delivery and command, there's quick-moving setup man potential for the NUMBER-year-old.",0
"After seeing the wheels fall off during his first trip to Triple-A in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION sent PERSON back to Double-A in NUMBER in the hopes he could right the ship.When PERSON has had success as a starter, his fastball was a tick above average, with good sink to it. His average slider would flash plus, with good bite and depth. PERSON's changeup was solid as well, thrown with deception and fade. He became too timid in NUMBER, and he didn't attack hitters like he had in the past. PERSON was guilty of throwing too many strikes at times, making him much more hittable. PERSON sent PERSON back to Double-A in NUMBER to try and right the ship. PERSON's best role might end up in the bullpen, where his fastball gains a few ticks of velocity and his overall command wouldn't be as much of an issue. He received his first big league callup, as a reliever, in September.",1
"GPE and speed. It's a combination always in high demand in a player, but often difficult to find. But there's no question PERSON has plenty of both, and not the raw kind of tools that never show up. His outstanding bat speed allows the ORGANIZATION of GSP product to drive the ball to all fields, with plenty of power to leave the yard regularly. While he does tend to strike out a good amount, most feel he'll hit enough to tap into that power and hit for a little average. His speed is legit and he should continue to be a threat on the basepaths and a well above-average defensive center fielder, though he has the arm for right field should that be the spot the ORGANIZATION need him to play. He gets very high marks for his makeup and energy. PERSON went NUMBER-NUMBER in his first full season of pro ball and there's no reason to think that won't be a regular occurrence for him in the future.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"In many ways, PERSON has done as well as, or better than, could have been expected when he signed as a gangly teenager back in NUMBER. He's gotten bigger and stronger and, after making his full-season debut in NUMBER, has moved rather quickly, reaching Double-A in NUMBER while finishing in the top NUMBER among all Phillies pitching prospects in ORGANIZATION. He was spending his first full season at the level when he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION won't get a long look at him until NUMBER, however, as the right-hander underwent PERSON surgery in October and will miss the NUMBER season.Pure stuff-wise, PERSON is as good as just about any pitching prospect in the system, with a fastball that touches the upper-NUMBERs consistently combined with a curve that often flashes plus. His changeup has improved and it could eventually become an average third pitch, something softer to distrupt hitters' timing. He's generally around the strike zone, though his command has been inconsistent as he is still learning to get all of his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame in sync on a regular basis. For as good as PERSON's stuff is, he hasn't missed as many bats as you would think. He needs to continue to learn how to sequence pitches and set up hitters more effectively so he can put them away more frequently.PERSON gets high marks for his makeup and intelligence, as he learned GPE quickly so he could better communicate with teammates and coaches.",0
"While scouts were split on PERSON in terms of playable now tools vs. rawness, he was nonetheless ranked No. NUMBER on MLBPipeline.com's Top NUMBER ORGANIZATION list heading into the July NUMBER signing period. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw, giving the GPE $NUMBER.NUMBER million as part of an aggressive push in the Latin GPE market.Some feel PERSON will be able to help a big league team in a short time, while others feel he looks crude in the field. Some of that has to do with a lack of a true defensive home, with the NUMBER-year-old playing mostly second base and center field, though he did play shortstop in the GPE junior leagues. He has good speed, which gives him good range wherever he plays, though he understandably needs work on his reads and routes in the outfield since he lacks experience out there. Those who watched him in GPE, where he went after leaving GPE, feel he can play up the middle somewhere. PERSON's speed, along with strong instrincts, allows him to be a basestealing threat. At the plate, he has outstanding bat control and an advanced approach. He could have enough power to reach double digits in the home run department.With the investment the ORGANIZATION made, they clearly feel PERSON has the tools to be an everyday player at the big league level. Now it will be up to the player development staff to figure out just where he fits best to maximize his potential.",0
"The ORGANIZATION hope GPE will buck history after they signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER as their third-round pick in June.He stands NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, which would match the tallest height ever for a regular catcher in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON often are wary of big backstops because they have longer releases and tend not to move well behind the plate, but they actually rate his defense more highly than his offense.GPE has a strong, accurate arm. He's surprisingly agile for his size, receives the ball well and exhibits fine leaderships skills. His defensive ability and makeup were major reasons why he made the GPE collegiate national team in each of the previous two summers (though he missed out in NUMBER because of a knee injury).Ultimately, GPE's bat will determine whether he's an everyday player or a backup at the big league level. His size and strength give him plenty of raw power, but his right-handed swing can get long and he has yet to fully tap into his pop in game situations.",0
"The ORGANIZATION acquired PERSON from the ORGANIZATION at the NUMBER PERSON along with PERSON for PERSON and PERSON. After impressing in Double-A after the trade, PERSON turned a big Spring Training into a surprise Opening Day roster spot. He helped initially out of the bullpen and was making a move to the rotation when an oblique strain put him on the shelf, returning near the end of the season. On the cusp of losing prospect status, the ORGANIZATION sent him to the Cardinals in December in the ORGANIZATION GarcÃ­a deal. PERSON will never wow with pure stuff, but he has an extremely good feel for pitching. He can move his average fastball up and down, in and out. He throws his changeup with good sink, and his curve has improved to give him three Major League average offerings, all of which he can throw for strikes. He has a funky delivery that causes deception, and he uses his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame well to throw downhill. PERSON's ceiling is limited to that of being a back-end starter. With good mound presence and a fearless approach to go along with his pitchability, he's a pretty good bet to reach that ceiling.",1
"After PERSON helped ORGANIZATION win the NUMBER College World Series and starred with the GPE collegiate national team and in the ORGANIZATION during the summer, he entered last year as the top-rated prospect on the ORGANIZATION -- ahead of eventually ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick PERSON and ORGANIZATION. NUMBER choice PERSON. PERSON missed his first two starts with elbow soreness and never really looked NUMBER percent, concluding his junior season by getting knocked out early in the final game of the ORGANIZATION. He dropped to the ORGANIZATION with the NUMBERth overall pick and signed for a below-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER at the deadline amid reports that he needed PERSON surgery, which he had in early August.When fully healthy as a sophomore, PERSON displayed four pitches that graded as solid or better and threw them all for strikes. He consistently worked at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball, with its command more notable than its life. He throws two distinct breaking balls and can miss bats with both his curveball and slider, as well as with his changeup.Even before he got hurt, there were some concerns as to whether PERSON's slight build could hold up to the demands of being a pro starter. He had no physical issues before his elbow gave out, however, and his athleticism and ability to repeat his sound delivery enabled him to maintain quality stuff deep into games.",1
"Most teams didn't evaluate PERSON as a first-round talent in the NUMBER Draft, but the ORGANIZATION loved his bat, so they drafted him NUMBERth overall and paid him a $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER bonus. He has justified their faith, winning the Rookie-level PERSON MVP award in his pro debut and finishing second in the short-season LOCATION in hitting (.NUMBER) in NUMBER. Last year he skipped a level to high Class A and batted .NUMBER at age NUMBER.PERSON is an extremely advanced hitter for his age, with outstanding hand-eye coordination that allows him to barrel balls repeatedly. He almost does so too easily, making so much hard contact that it cuts into his walk totals. Being more selective also would help his power totals, as he has the bat speed to produce NUMBER homers per season if he waits for pitches he can drive.PERSON has sure hands and solid arm strength at shortstop, but his fringy speed and range likely will lead to a position change down the line. PERSON thinks he's an underrated defender but also has PERSON at shortstop and PERSON at second base in the big leagues. PERSON might profile best at third base and also could wind up on an outfield corner.",1
"PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION as a catcher out of GPE in NUMBER but became a pitcher after batting .NUMBER in two years in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION. He didn't post a sub-NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in a full-season league until NUMBER, when he jumped from high Class A to GPE before getting traded to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in December. After he performed well out of the big league bullpen in the last six weeks of the NUMBER season, he blew out his elbow the following spring and missed all of NUMBER following PERSON surgery.PERSON has bounced back this year, reclaiming his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that can reach triple digits. He gets a lot of swings and misses with his heater, and hitters tend to beat it into the ground when they do make contact. His slider also can be overpowering, topping out in the low NUMBERs with nasty break when it's on.Though he has the pure stuff to be a closer, PERSON will have to prove he can throw enough strikes and locate his pitches well enough before he's trusted in the late innings. He overthrows at times, causing his fastball and slider to flatten out, and he gets hit hard when that happens.",1
"PERSON turned down the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-round pick out of high school in NUMBER, then created buzz by pitching in the mid NUMBERs during the fall at ORGANIZATION (GPE) JC. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as an NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER, he led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA two years later but missed all of NUMBER following PERSON surgery. After the ORGANIZATION eased him back in during 'NUMBER, he ranked second in the Double-A PERSON in strikeouts (NUMBER) and third in strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) last year.PERSON's best pitch is his fastball, which sits in the mid NUMBERs with heavy sink. His mid-NUMBERs slider gives him a solid second offering when he stays on top of it. His changeup lags behind the rest of his arsenal because it gets too firm and he had trouble locating it for strikes.The key for PERSON is maintaining a direct line to the plate, because when he doesn't, his pitches lose their sharpness and wander up in the strike zone. He has decent control but his command isn't as fine, so some scouts think he'll be better suited for the bullpen. His fastball sat at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and repeatedly reached triple digits when he was a reliever in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER.",0
"The ORGANIZATION lost a pair of outfield prospects in the NUMBER Rule NUMBER Draft in PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION selected with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER pick, and PERSON. Originally a ninth-round Draft pick out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON was left off the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER-man roster in spite of a breakout NUMBER campaign in which he hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER extra-base hits and NUMBER steals across three levels, finishing the year in Triple-A.A right-handed hitter, PERSON has a short, quick swing that yields a lot of contact, and he does a good job of using the whole field. His on-base skills have improved as he's moved up the ladder, thanks to a mature approach and advanced feel for the strike zone, and he knows how to use his plus speed when he gets on.PERSON's speed also makes him a rangy defender in the outfield, and he's capable of playing all three positions. He spent the offseason playing winter ball in the ORGANIZATION, where he paced the league in total bases and ORGANIZATION and ranked second in home runs and doubles. And while PERSON has played just NUMBER games above the Double-A level, the ORGANIZATION see him as a capable bench outfielder for the NUMBER season.",0
"A NUMBERth-round pick out of GPE in NUMBER who signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER and posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his pro debut, PERSON wasn't on any prospect lists before last summer. Then he was named pitcher of the year in the Rookie-level PERSON, which he led with NUMBER strikeouts and NUMBER.NUMBER whiffs per nine innings. Completing his breakout, he had NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings at low Class A Great Lakes, where he fanned NUMBER in one game to break PERSON's franchise record.Once PERSON made significant improvements to his conditioning and mechanics, his stuff took off. His fastball jumped from the low NUMBERs to the mid NUMBERs, and his slider jumped into the low NUMBERs with better depth. Both qualify as legitimate swing-and-miss pitches.PERSON's changeup has taken a big step forward in NUMBER, surpassing his slider as his best secondary offering. His control and command have gotten better along with the quality of his pitches. He's proving that what he showed at the end of NUMBER is for real and looks like a frontline starter.",1
"Named the ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON continued his strong play the next spring, as he finished second in the country in hitting and led PERSON to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON brought an early end to his professional debut, and he underwent surgery to repair a partially torn right labrum in October. He had not returned to the field by the end of July. PERSON is the rare backstop who could have average or better tools across the board. He has a steady, quick swing, enabling him to hit line drives to all fields. He has good raw power, but his swing produces more doubles than home runs. PERSON has elite athleticism for a catcher, and it gives scouts confidence that he will be able to remain behind the plate. He is a good receiver and has the requisite arm strength for a catcher, though his accuracy has room for improvement.",0
"When PERSON first joined the ORGANIZATION organization, signed back in NUMBER out of GPE, he was a thin, awkward, Bambi-like teenager who could really defend and barely hit. While he's still a glove-first shortstop, PERSON has matured considerably into a guy ready to play in the big leagues.PERSON did just that during his Major League debut in NUMBER, filling in for the injured PERSON for nearly all of September. While he's never going to have much power, PERSON has added enough strength to show the bat won't be knocked out of his hands by high-level pitching, making consistent line-drive contact. He's slowed down a tick as he's matured, but he's still a good baserunner who can steal a base. He also has more than enough range and arm to stay at shortstop long term. He's not the flashy type, but will make every play, the kind of infielder you want the ball hit to.PERSON is obviously blocked at short by PERSON, who is under control through NUMBER. The NUMBER-year-old is ready for another big league opportunity, especially after a strong showing in his home country's winter league.",1
"PERSON was acquired from GPE in NUMBER as one third of the ORGANIZATION' return for PERSON, along with PERSON and J.D. PERSON, both NUMBER FV type prospects. PERSON is just a touch above that level, despite being a somewhat generic right-handed depth starter. PERSON has three average-to-slightly-above pitches that can flash NUMBER at moments due to his feel for pitching. It isn't swing-and-miss stuff, and is probably more middle reliever or spot starter than rotation stalwart given pitcher attrition, but he has plus makeup, knows how to pitch, and should be in Double-A next year.",0
"There's warranted age-based skepticism of PERSON's numbers at Hi- and Double-A each of the last two years, but it's encouraging that he had such a strong NUMBER after a bad month and a half at FACILITY the year prior. He was similarly excellent during NUMBER spring training, though most of his at-bats came against late-inning reserve arms. But as a versatile infielder with terrific control of the strike zone, PERSON is a very rosterable big leaguer who should give you good at-bats off the bench. His career peripherals are strong and may be an indication that we're sleeping on him a bit because of his age.",0
"The nephew of PERSON, GPE was one of the more divisive players in the NUMBER Draft, with some scouts pegging him as a future power-hitting third baseman, and others seeing him as more of a one-dimensional player with questions about his hit tool. GPE's big, raw power was too enticing to pass over for the PERSON, who secured his future with a $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus after selecting him in the second round. He hit his way up to the Class A Advanced PERSON in his pro debut and swung the bat well there to open NUMBER, ultimately earning promotion to Double-A just a year into his career. GPE's intrigue lies in his potential to hit for both average and power. The latter is more strength-driven than it is a product of his bat speed, though he does know how to get to it. GPE hit for more average during his final two NC State campaigns, as well as in the ORGANIZATION, but he'll need to control the zone better and make more contact to be successful as a pro. As a fringy runner with a thicker lower half, GPE isn't a clean fit on paper at shortstop. However, PERSON club officials have been impressed with his performance there so far, noting that he has the instincts and feel for the position despite a lack of outstanding defensive tools. He'll be given every chance to prove he can stick up the middle, but it's widely believed that he'll end up at the hot corner, where his glove, strong arm and power potential are all fits.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have a knack for finding and developing tremendous pitching talent and PERSON is no exception. The former high school standout from the ORGANIZATION has thrown very well at two rookie levels since joining the organization in NUMBER as the ORGANIZATION try to protect his impressive left arm. PERSON will touch NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball now and there might be more in the tank as he matures. His changeup is the better of his two secondary offerings right now and it might be a consistently plus pitch for him. His slider might project to plus as well, though it's just average right now. He generally throws strikes and he should have at least average command in the future. The ORGANIZATION are great about being patient with their pitching prospects, so PERSON will start moving more quickly when he's ready.",0
"PERSON logged time in GPE A&M's rotation as a freshman in NUMBER before transferring to PERSON (GPE) CC, making him Draft-eligible as a sophomore. After ranking second among national junior college pitchers in strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings), he signed for a below-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER as a third-rounder. In a system filled with pitchers who missed bats, he ranked second among qualified starters in whiff rate (NUMBER.NUMBER) last year while reaching PERSON Advanced.PERSON gets his strikeouts by changing hitters' eye level and attacking them with NUMBER-NUMBER mph four-seam fastballs with riding life at the letters before dropping upper-NUMBERs curveballs through the bottom of the strike zone. He has sharpened his slider in pro ball and shows the makings of an effective changeup.Though PERSON could have four average-or-better pitches when fully developed and is throwing strikes more consistently as a pro, he still could wind up in the bullpen. There's a lot going on in his delivery, which features effort and some head whack, so he'll have to prove he has enough command and durability to make it as a starter. Getting stronger and streamlining his mechanics would help his cause.",0
"PERSON has long intrigued scouts because of his raw tools, body and athleticism. His performance at ORGANIZATION didn't always measure up, however, a reason why he wasn't a first-rounder as many thought he might be. If he can find a way to consistently tap into those tools, the ORGANIZATION may have a steal on their hands. PERSON can flat-out run and he has some definite extra-base potential. He's very aggressive at the plate, which can lead to high strikeout totals, and he'll have to reign that in to find success as he moves up. He never had a true defensive home at ORGANIZATION, and the ORGANIZATION let him play a little shortstop and center field - perhaps his long-term home - during his pro debut.",0
"Since signing for a $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus -- a record for a GPE player -- in January NUMBER, PERSON advanced rapidly to Double-A. He has the best combination of raw power and pure arm strength among PERSON catchers, though he's still polishing those tools and the other aspects of his game. Unfortunately for him, his NUMBER season was put on hold when he underwent surgery on his left ankle in June. That didn't keep the Phillies from wanting him, making sure he was included in the package they received in return for PERSON has the strength and bat speed to drive balls out of any part of any ballpark without selling out for power, yet he's still overly aggressive at the plate. He swings and misses frequently, and he needs to do a better job of taking pitches and recognizing breaking balls. If he figures it out, he could be an average hitter with NUMBER-plus homers per season in the big leagues. Similarly, he has a cannon arm and good athleticism for a catcher but needs a lot of refinement behind the plate. He threw out just NUMBER percent of basestealers and committed NUMBER passed balls in NUMBER games in NUMBER. Though he has played first base and tried the outfield in instructional league play, it's too soon to give up on the idea that he can become an All-Star catcher.",1
"The biggest thing holding ORGANIZATION back so far has been health. If he can stay on the field, he has the chance to contribute.ORGANIZATION turned out to be the ORGANIZATION' top signee in NUMBER when PERSON didn't sign. A variety of leg issues allowed him to amass only NUMBER games in just over a year of pro ball. ORGANIZATION does have solid tools across the board. He has the chance to hit, with some power, from the right side of the plate. ORGANIZATION has the speed to steal a base and potentially stay in center field, though some think left field might be his eventual home.Before figuring that out, ORGANIZATION needs to get a full season of at-bats in. If it can all come together, he has the potential to at the very least be a valuable fourth outfielder type.",0
"After helping PERSON to a runner-up finish at the NUMBER College World Series, PERSON batted .NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION and would have led the prestigious summer circuit in hitting if he hadn't been a few plate appearances shy of qualifying. He won the Pac-NUMBER Conference batting title (.NUMBER) and topped ORGANIZATION Division I with a school-record NUMBER doubles this spring, establishing himself as one of the best college hitters available in the NUMBER PERSON. He signed for a below-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER as a supplemental second-round pick gained from the ORGANIZATION as punishment for their hacking scandal.PERSON started to produce more consistently in college when he became more disciplined, working deeper counts and waiting for pitches he could punish. He makes contact almost too easily because it cuts into his walk totals. He's strong and creates plenty of bat speed from the left side of the plate, though he figures to hit more for average than power.While he has an average arm, PERSON lacks speed and quickness, limiting his defensive ability. PERSON used him mostly at first base and ORGANIZATION, while PERSON broke him into pro ball as a left fielder. The ORGANIZATION announced him as a second baseman on PERSON Day and plan to try him there in instructional league.",0
"PERSON PERSON served the ORGANIZATION quite well. After they acquired him at the NUMBER trade deadline, he helped them win the World Series. And when PERSON dealt him at the NUMBER trade deadline, he brought back the slick-fielding PERSON.PERSON is the best middle-infield defender in the ORGANIZATION system. He covers ground, has soft hands and the arm strength required to make all of the necessary throws. He needs to improve his consistency, though that's true of most young shortstops.Offensively, PERSON has a ceiling as a No. NUMBER hitter. He has good balance at the plate and makes consistent contact, though he can get too aggressive and his walk rate nosedived when he got to full-season ball in NUMBER. He won't be a power threat, though he's an average runner with good instincts on the bases.",0
"Signed as an international free agent out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON produced mixed results early in his career, but still made steady progress through GPE's system. He put it all together during his NUMBER full-season debut, beginning the year with PERSON before advancing to the ORGANIZATION State League in GPE. Altogether, the toolsy outfielder led all Blue Jays farmhands in both runs scored (NUMBER) and triples (NUMBER) while finishing second in home runs (NUMBER) and third in GPE (NUMBER). PERSON' performance caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, and they acquired him and reliever PERSON for ORGANIZATION in January.Wiry and athletic, PERSON stands out as much for his remaining physical projection as he does for his present athleticism and tools. He combines bat speed with a short right-handed swing to produce lots of hard contact, generating good extension through the ball and driving it to all fields. He began to tap into his above-average raw power and cleared fences more regularly in NUMBER, and scouts believe there'll be more power to come once he adds strength to his lean frame and better learns to leverage his swing. PERSON knows how to use his well above-average speed on the basepaths as well as in the outfield, where he possesses the necessary range for all three positions and a strong enough arm to play right. Despite his capacity to contribute in all phases of the game, PERSON' power-speed combo is his true calling card and could make him a regular at maturity.",0
"PERSON appeared in six games for ORGANIZATION (N.Y) as a freshman before transferring to GPE Stroudsburg University (Pa.), where he showed steady improvement as a starter over the next three years en route to becoming PERSON's seventh-round pick as a senior in NUMBER. A full-time move to the bullpen led to a breakout first full season for PERSON, as he showed impressive bat-missing ability, garnered All-Star honors in the Class A Advanced GPE League, and then capped his season with a successful turn in the ORGANIZATION. And while he began NUMBER in extended spring training due to a hip/sciatic issue, PERSON quickly made up for the lost time in Double-A upon returning and earned his first big league promotion in July. PERSON's smooth delivery and short, clean arm action create late life on a fastball that will sit NUMBER-NUMBER mph while touching NUMBER. He pairs his heater with a sharp, late-breaking slider in the mid- to upper-NUMBERs, and it's those two offerings that enabled him to pace all GPE League relievers with NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts-per-nine innings. The right-hander also has a curveball and changeup, both slightly below-average pitches, at his disposal, and his entire arsenal does play up on account of his solid control and command.PERSON's four-pitch mix and overall durability makes him a candidate to one day rejoin a starting rotation, should the ORGANIZATION ever choose to pursue that route. For now, however, it's PERSON's knack for missing bats using largely his fastball-slider combo that is his ticket to a potential late-inning role in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON began his college career at FACILITY A&M before transferring to GPE, where he paced the LOCATION Conference in average (.NUMBER), home runs (NUMBER) and stolen bases (NUMBER) en route to ORGANIZATION of the Year honors in his second year with the Aggies. Intrigued by his combination of tools and performance, the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON $NUMBER,NUMBER after selecting him in the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft. He's firmly put himself on the radar in his first full season, showing impressive power along as well as a better-than-expected feel for the game while playing in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION. PERSON fits the bill of a raw-but-toolsy college player, standing out for his elite speed and arm strength, as well as explosive athleticism that could help him stick in center field long term. He's less advanced at the plate, where he employs an aggressive approach and shows some feel for finding the barrel. He generates impressive raw power through a combination of physical strength and lightning-quick bat speed.Though his tools are loud, PERSON will need time to refine his overall baseball skills on both sides of the ball. If it all comes together, he could develop into a dynamic outfielder capable of impacting games in several ways.",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON so much that they drafted him twice. He turned them down as a sophomore-eligible in the NUMBERst round in NUMBER, opting instead to play for the GPE collegiate national team and return to GPE. He signed as a fifth-rounder a year ago and made the jump to high Class A to begin his first full pro season.PERSON has decent tools across the board and profiles as a utilityman more than a regular. He makes consistent contact from the right side, albeit with modest power and on-base skills, so he fits toward the bottom of a batting order. He's an average runner whose instincts help him on the bases and in the field.PERSON played exclusively at shortstop in his pro debut and split time between there and third base in NUMBER. He has fringy range at short but still manages to make his share of plays, and his solid arm works anywhere in the infield.

"PERSON PERSON's nephew was one of the more divisive players in the NUMBER Draft, with some scouts pegging him as a future power-hitting third baseman, and others seeing him as more of a one-dimensional player with questions about his hit tool. GPE's big, raw power was too enticing to pass over for the ORGANIZATION, who secured his future with a $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus after selecting him in the second round. GPE's power is more strength-driven than it is a product of his bat speed. He lacks plate discipline and has a pull-happy, swing-for-the-fences approach that he'll have to tone down against pro pitching. He did have more success with wood bats on the Cape than he ever has with metal bats at FACILITY, so his proponents think he can make adjustments.A below-average runner who doesn't always exhibit a lot of energy on the diamond, GPE was miscast as a shortstop for the ORGANIZATION. He lacks range and is an erratic defender, though his soft hands and strong arm should play much better as a third baseman.",0
"The ORGANIZATION nabbed PERSON in the seventh round of the NUMBER Draft and then signed the ORGANIZATION State product for $NUMBER,NUMBER. Though he didn't see much mound time in his pro debut at ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON, the left-hander was nothing short of dominant in his pair of relief outings as he struck out NUMBER batters and allowed just three baserunners in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings. After injuries delayed the start of what was expected to be his first full pro season, PERSON made just five appearances, including two with PERSON, before an elbow injury in late July prematurely ended his season and required PERSON surgery. PERSON's fastball, which registers NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches NUMBER, is more effective than its pure velocity and lack of downhill plane would indicate. He has an extreme crossfire delivery that makes him highly deceptive and gives his heater nice run and sink. It also allows him to work inside against right-handers with confidence. PERSON's breaking ball has potential but is inconsistent, ranging from a fringy slider in the low NUMBERs to a promising cutter with good slicing action in the upper NUMBERs. He also features a promising changeup with some sink and generally throws a lot of strikes. Although scouts believe PERSON has a chance to remain a starter and eventually surface at the back of a big league rotation, he also has the potential to move quickly in a bullpen role, where he can utilize his fastball-slider pairing. But considering that PERSON is unlikely to take the mound in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION will have time to assess his ultimate role.",0
"PERSON's velocity wavered when he was a high school senior in NUMBER, so he dropped to the NUMBERth round of the GPE. PERSON along slowly after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER, he didn't reach full-season ball until NUMBER, when he teamed in a piggyback-starter system with fellow lefty PERSON. While he doesn't throw as hard as PERSON, PERSON rates as a better prospect because he has a better chance to start.PERSON usually sits around NUMBER mph with his fastball, which tops out at NUMBER and features some cutting action. His changeup gives him a solid second pitch and he shows feel for spinning a curveball, though it lacks consistency.He can't blow the ball by hitters, but PERSON succeeds by throwing strikes and working down in the zone. He has added NUMBER pounds since turning pro and still has more projection remaining in his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame.",0
"PERSON' talent could have landed him in the second round of the NUMBER Draft, but his strong commitment to pitch and also kick for the football team at FACILITY dropped him to the NUMBERth round. The ORGANIZATION signed him at the deadline for $NUMBER.NUMBER million, still a Draft record for after the third round, then watched him flounder with control issues and minor injuries for his first five pro seasons. He has broken out in NUMBER, blowing away hitters with three power pitches and finally reaching Double-A.PERSON is throwing better than ever, ranging from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with a fastball that has some run and sink. When it was trying to develop him as a starter, GPE had him concentrate on improving his fastball command, which cost him some feel for his curveball, his best offering as an amateur. His hard downer curve in the lower NUMBERs is back in his arsenal, and he also has developed an upper-NUMBERs slider that's even more of a wipeout pitch.Though he's a good athlete, PERSON never has had a pretty delivery and still struggles to find the strike zone. If he can acquire even average control, he could become a closer. While that may be too much to ask, he has the pure stuff to help the ORGANIZATION in the near future.",0
"PERSON is a product of PERSON (Spring, FACILITY), which has produced three first-round picks in GPE, PERSON and PERSON and a fourth big leaguer in GPE.

He posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his first full pro season but has been more effective in his second.PERSON has added fastball velocity since turning pro, going from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with the Aggies to sitting at NUMBER-NUMBER and peaking at NUMBER this year. His changeup is his most effective secondary pitch and is the main reason why he has been much more effective against left-handers than right-handers in NUMBER. His lack of a consistent breaking ball is another contributing factor, though he has made some improvements with his curve.Though he throws hard, PERSON doesn't miss a lot of bats, in part because his command is fringy. While PERSON has deployed him as a starter for most of his pro career, his future may be in the bullpen. He could add even more fastball velocity if used in shorter stints.",0
"PERSON chose to attend GPE (GPE) JC rather than sign with the ORGANIZATION as an NUMBERth-round PERSON pick in NUMBER. He became property of the Marlins the following year, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER in the NUMBERth round, and then made a name for himself on both sides of the ball with a strong pro debut in the ORGANIZATION. He continues to impress in NUMBER, earning an All-Star nod in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION after ranking among the circuit's top hitters in the first half.PERSON shows good feel for hitting, with a short, clean swing from the right side that yields consistently hard contact to all fields. He doesn't show much power presently, but scouts believe he'll develop average pop based on his projectable frame, solid bat speed and leveraged plane through the hitting zone. Meanwhile, PERSON's average speed serves him well on the basepaths, as well as in the field. A shortstop as an amateur, PERSON spent his entire pro debut at the hot corner, where he profiles as an average defender with good athleticism and range as well as a plus arm.PERSON may have been a little-known commodity prior to last year's PERSON, but the early returns in his pro career, along with his across-the-board tools and remaining physical projection, suggests he could develop into an everyday player at the hot corner.",0
"Sometimes repeating a level isn't such a bad thing. That's what ORGANIZATION did in NUMBER after a subpar first taste of the LOCATION League in NUMBER and if it hadn't been for PERSON's NUMBER-steal season, ORGANIZATION' NUMBER steals in NUMBER would have generated a ton of buzz around baseball. Just like his father, he profiles a compact and strong leadoff hitter, though junior might end up with more power than dad had. The younger ORGANIZATION did just about everything more consistently in his second full season, from using all fields to drawing walks, from success on the basepaths to improving his glovework. Not only does he have plus plus speed, he understands how to use it as an effective basestealer. His defense at second has improved, but even if that doesn't work out, he has the tools to make a move to center field eventually if needed.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON didn't produce a first-round pick in the first NUMBER Drafts before the ORGANIZATION took PERSON (who didn't sign) in NUMBER, and they came back last year for PERSON. One of four ORGANIZATION catchers taken in the first NUMBER choices last June, PERSON stood out with his athleticism and throwing ability. Though he didn't put up big offensive numbers in his pro debut, he did advance to high Class A.PERSON is a rare catcher who earns some plus grades for his speed, and his quickness helps his solid arm strength play even better. He threw out NUMBER percent of attempted basestealers in his introduction to pro ball while displaying advanced receiving skills and good agility behind the plate. PERSON even gave him playing time at second and third base as well.After hitting a combined .NUMBER with two homers in his first two college seasons, PERSON boosted his stock by batting .NUMBER with seven homers as a junior. He emphasizes making contact with a short right-handed stroke, though he did strike out NUMBER times in NUMBER games when he was pushed quickly during his debut. He has a bit of pull power but is much more of an on-base machine than a slugger.",0
"PERSON had a huge junior year at ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, finishing second in ORGANIZATION Division I in homers (NUMBER), ORGANIZATION (NUMBER) and total bases (NUMBER) before the ORGANIZATION made him the second-highest pick (third round) in school history. His ORGANIZATION dropped from .NUMBER in his pro debut to .NUMBER in high Class A last year, when he was hampered by hamate and shoulder injuries. He has rebounded nicely in NUMBER despite losing a month to a hamstring strain.PERSON doesn't have the smoothest right-handed swing but usually makes consistent hard contact to all fields. The strength and leverage in his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound frame gives him power to all fields, and he's at his best when he doesn't worry about home runs. He fell into the trap of trying to do too much to make up for lost time in NUMBER but has shown a more disciplined approach this year.Athletic for his size, PERSON has average speed out of the batter's box and is a step quicker once he hits his stride. He has solid arm strength and enough range for right field, though he'll likely be a better fit in left field at spacious AT&T Park.",0
"Though the ORGANIZATION forfeited their NUMBER first-round pick to sign free agent PERSON, they felt like they got a first-round talent in the second round with PERSON. He led PERSON's NUMBER national championship team in hitting (.NUMBER) and slugging (.NUMBER) as a freshman, helped the ORGANIZATION finish runner-up at the NUMBER College World Series and ranked second in the LOCATION in GPE (NUMBER.NUMBER) last spring. He also performed well with the GPE collegiate national team and in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON may not have a true plus tool, but he was one of the most well-rounded college position players in the NUMBER Draft. He's a switch-hitter with a smooth stroke and feel for the barrel from both sides, though there are some concerns about whether he'll make enough contact against quality pitching. He has a knack for drawing walks and began to drive the ball more as a junior, smashing NUMBER homers after totaling nine in his first two college seasons.PERSON has solid speed and knows how to use it. He has good basestealing aptitude, gets good jumps and covers plenty of ground in center field. If he has to move to an outfield corner, he'll probably slide over to left field because he has below-average arm strength.",0
"PERSON wasn't highly regarded coming out of the ORGANIZATION, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER in March NUMBER, NUMBER months after he first became eligible. The ORGANIZATION kept him in GPE ball for his first two pro seasons before he made his full-season debut in NUMBER and helped low Class A Quad Cities win the ORGANIZATION championship. PERSON features some of the best pitchability among the ORGANIZATION' younger pitching prospects. His pair of quality breaking balls and his ability to mix and spot his pitches allowed him to average NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts per nine innings this season. His fastball usually ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER mph and tops out at NUMBER, and he also shows aptitude for employing his changeup.Because he doesn't have a lot of projection in his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame, PERSON probably will have average fastball velocity at best. He'll need to challenge hitters more often at higher levels after his walk rate rose to a career-high NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings in NUMBER. If he can't make it as a back-of-the-rotation starter, his slider and curveball could make him a useful right-on-right reliever.",0
"PERSON came back from PERSON surgery as a sophomore and a transfer to PERSON to land in the third round of the NUMBER Draft after being one of the best college pitching performers in the class. Like fellow D-backs draftee PERSON, he began his pro career slowly as a reliever in short-season ball. Even though PERSON was dominant, not allowing a run as PERSON won the LOCATION title, his future should be as a starter.PERSON's success stems from his ability to throw his low-NUMBERs fastball pretty much wherever he wants to. In shorter relief stints, the right-hander was reaching back for more, moving it in and out and throwing extremely downhill with plus life. PERSON complements his fastball with a slider that misses bats. He didn't use his changeup much during his pro debut, but he has a solid feel for one. PERSON can throw all of his pitches for strikes, and he seems to have a good sense of when to expand the zone to get hitters to chase.PERSON has a strong, durable frame, one that should hold up to the rigors of being in a rotation. After his stunning debut, the D-backs know he could be extremely successful in a relief role should starting not work out.",0
"Few players in the ORGANIZATION system have as great a difference between their present ability and future potential than PERSON. Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, he has spent four consecutive years in GPE ball because he's still raw on the mound. At the same time, his ceiling is huge.PERSON is a big left-hander with a fastball that already reaches NUMBER mph and features nice life. He still can add more strength to his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame, so more velocity could be in his future. He has a chance to have two average secondary pitches, with his changeup currently grading better than his slider.Pedromo's control and command are still very much works in progress, and he might turn out to be a reliever than a starter. As a southpaw who could grow into a mid-NUMBERs fastball, he'll get plenty of opportunity to prove himself.",0
"An athletic, toolsy outfielder, PERSON impressed during his professional debut in NUMBER, reaching Double-A Harrisburg and finishing the year in the ORGANIZATION. He wasn't able to repeat that success over the next two seasons, and a torn labrum in his left shoulder kept him out for the last two months of the NUMBER season. PERSON's raw tools earned him a $NUMBER million bonus as a NUMBER supplemental first-rounder and remain impressive, but he'll need to make some adjustments to tap into them. He's a patient hitter, knows how to get on base and, at his best, uses the whole field to hit. He creates good bat speed and has worked to simplify his swing, but there's a fair amount of swing-and-miss in his game and he struggles against left-handers.Defensively, PERSON's speed, arm strength and instincts make him a solid defender. His speed and defense should be enough to get him to the big leagues and he still has the ability to be an everyday center fielder if he can put everything together.",0
"Royals assistant general manager PERSON and his staff have found several bargains on the international market, and GPE looked like one of the best after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. He quickly became one of the system's top pitching prospects, appearing in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON at age NUMBER in 'NUMBER and making his big league debut two years later. But GPE's ORGANIZATION rose for four straight years, soaring to NUMBER.NUMBER during a disastrous NUMBER season that included a demotion to the bullpen in July and another to Double-A in GPE, before he reversed that trend in NUMBER.GPE has a pair of pitches that earn well-above-average grades at times. He has a running fastball that sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reaches at NUMBER in short stints, and he uses it to set up a deceptive changeup with sink. He has had only sporadic success spinning a breaking ball, but he's doing a better job of at least using his curveball rather than relying too heavily on his changeup.Scouts who believe in GPE see some similarities between him and PERSON, and they think he still has potential as a starter. PERSON may need him more as a reliever in NUMBER, and he could be a late-inning option if he stays in the bullpen. He has pitched well in both roles in the Minors this season, and his future looks brighter than it did a year ago.",1
"Considering how much of the current PERSON regime came over from GPE, one would think the two orgs would not only target similar types of talent but also have similar developmental vision for that talent. This does not appear to have been the case with GPE, who was a prospect afterthought when he was part of a seemingly innocuous trade between the PERSON and ORGANIZATION just after the NUMBER season. GPE had been a PERSON NUMBERth round pick out of GPE College a year and a half prior to the deal and, like clockwork, had only struck out about six batters per nine innings every year in college, as well as in his first two pro seasons. The PERSON altered GPE's position on the rubber and made other mechanical tweaks to alter the movement profile of his pitches. After the ORGANIZATION acquired him, they let him return to what he was doing in college and he vastly exceeded even the most optimistic expectations in NUMBER. He led the ORGANIZATION system in strikeouts and innings while traversing three levels, reaching Triple-A. 
The lynchpin of GPE's success is his command of a dancing two-seam fastball that runs back onto his glove-side corner of the plate. Left-handed hitters think it's coming at their hip, righties give up on it because they think it's off the plate, and GPE gets a lot of looking strikeouts with it. There are questions about the quality of his secondary stuff. He has a quality changeup, but his breaking ball is mediocre. He seems to have added a cutter late in the year, and that pitch's movement may better complement that of his fastball. Most teams have GPE evaluated as a stable backend starter; some think he should be in the NUMBER FV tier of this list. A purported nerd and exhaustive pre-start preparer, GPE is a high-probability big leaguer who we believe has limited ceiling, though if he develops NUMBER or NUMBER command, all bets are off.",0
"PERSON parlayed a strong junior season at ORGANIZATION into an eighth-round selection by the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, only to have his pro debut cut short after just a week because of a foot injury. His first full season was interrupted by a separated shoulder in May and another disabled list stint in late August.When healthy, PERSON has shown he is the kind of heady middle infielder the ORGANIZATION thought they were drafting. PERSON makes consistent contact from the left side of the plate, though his well-below-average power makes some wonder about how much he'll hit as he moves up the ladder. He is a solid defender - the ORGANIZATION knew his glove was ahead of his bat when they took him - one who could stay at shortstop long term.PERSON is one of those college performers whose whole is greater than the sum of his parts, one who might be best suited for a utility role when all is said and done.",0
"After pitching at GPE (GPE) JC as a freshman in NUMBER, PERSON transferred to PERSON and was rear-ended in a high-speed car accident before taking the mound for the ORGANIZATION. Recovering from serious head injuries and gall bladder surgery, he worked just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in the next two years before winning ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year honors and moving on to LOCATION A&M. He led ORGANIZATION II in strikeouts (NUMBER) and strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) in NUMBER and became the highest pick in GPE history, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-rounder.PERSON has continued to miss bats as a pro, leading all Minor League relievers in whiffs (NUMBER) in NUMBER with the highest whiff rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) among pitchers with a least NUMBER innings. He does it with basically one pitch, a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that seems to rise at the plate and gets an exceptional amount of swings and misses in the strike zone. He has an over-the-top delivery, similar to PERSON's, and hitters don't see his heater well because it seemingly comes straight out of his ear.PERSON throws his fastball about NUMBER-NUMBER percent of the time and the ORGANIZATION would like to see him mix in a few more sliders and changeups and sequence them better. His curve gets NUMBER-to-NUMBER break thanks to his arm slot but could use more power, while his changeup is less advanced. He has little history of throwing strikes but has gotten away with it because of his unusual heater, though he'll probably need to be more precise when he faces more advanced hitters.",0
"PERSON was the top prospect in the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBER Draft class, with teams looking at him as a both a hitter and a pitcher. The ORGANIZATION went way over pick value to sign his bat and to keep him from going to the ORGANIZATION of GPE to be a two-way player. He has plenty of arm strength for third â he threw NUMBER mph from the mound â and while he may not win any Gold Gloves, thereâs the chance heâll be an adequate defender at third, albeit with limited range. But itâs that bat that should carry him, especially his power, which projects to be above-average to plus. The key will be how PERSONâs hit tool develops. He may never hit for a high average, but heâll have to make contact enough to tap into that power. A career as a power-hitting third baseman who tops out as a .NUMBER hitter seems like a fair projection.",0
"The FACILITY took ORGANIZATION closers in successive drafts, selecting PERSON in the first round in NUMBER and PERSON in the fourth round last year. He overcame PERSON surgery as a high school junior in NUMBER and turned down the ORGANIZATION as a sophomore-eligible NUMBERst-rounder in NUMBER before ranking third in ORGANIZATION Division I with NUMBER saves last spring. After signing him for $NUMBER,NUMBER, GPE shifted him to starting in August.PERSON has the three-pitch mix to make it in the rotation. When he keeps his heavy NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball down in the zone, batters struggle to lift it, as evidenced by his NUMBER.NUMBER groundout/flyout ratio during his debut. His changeup has similar action, resembling a splitter and grading as a plus pitch at its best, while his cutter reaches the upper NUMBERs.PERSON throws consistent strikes and has a strong build that should lend itself to durability. He started during two years of summer ball while in college, but he has yet to prove he can handle anything close to a full-season pro workload. If he doesn't make it as a starter, he could advance quickly as a reliever.",0
"PERSON may be getting used to not being the big man on campus, yet finding a way to succeed. He was a high school teammate of PERSON, who went No. NUMBER in the Draft in NUMBER when PERSON went No. NUMBER overall. Then he went to full-season ball at age NUMBER in first full year of pro ball and while his ORGANIZATION would've been good enough for ninth in the league had he thrown enough innings, flame-throwers PERSON and PERSON got more attention in the same rotation.PERSON had success, but he didn't dominate, leading his prospect star to perhaps unfairly fade just a bit. Right now, he pitches with average stuff across the board. But he has a tall and projectable frame, with the chance there is more in the tank. So while his fastball is average right now, albeit with good sink, he could very well pick up some velo as he physically matures. He's utilized two breaking balls in the past, but will focus just on the slider moving forward, a pitch that has improved since he entered pro ball and has the chance to be at least PERSON average. His changeup has gotten better as well, and he could be looking at three average or better offerings when all is said and done.Kind of like ORGANIZATION, PERSON is more pitcher than thrower at a young age. If the stuff takes a leap forward, then PERSON has the chance to move up this list in a hurry.",0
"There were high hopes for PERSON as he made the jump from PERSON Short-Season ball to the PERSON Advanced PERSON. But similarly to pitcher PERSON, that aggressive push was derailed by injuries.PERSON broke both hamate bones during the NUMBER season, and when he was on the field, he never really got himself going, leading to what amounted to a lost year. The tools, however, are still there. He has the potential to be a solid hitter with average power from both sides of the plate. That should give PERSON the offensive profile desired from someone at a corner infield position. The jury is still out whether that will ultimately be third. He's a fringy defender right now, but the ORGANIZATION feel he'll be good enough to stay there, with a strong arm to help make up for other inefficiencies.Before his injury-riddled campaign, PERSON appeared headed toward the list of top third-base prospects in the game. Just NUMBER for nearly all of the NUMBER season, there's more than enough time for him to hit the reset button.",0
"GPE ORGANIZATION won the ORGANIZATION World Series thanks to a high-octane offense that hit over .NUMBER and slugged .NUMBER. PERSON's left-handed bat with power was a huge part of that, with his top NUMBER finish nationally in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging a big reason why the ORGANIZATION took him in the second round and signed him for a below-pick value $NUMBER,NUMBER.PERSON has some serious raw power to tap into and he did so at GPE. Some scouts felt he had a tendency to push his hands away from his body at times, leaving him susceptible to balls in on him, leading to swings and misses. Others feel he'll hit more than enough to be a consistent threat as a pro, far from an all-or-nothing power guy. While he largely played first base at GPE, he runs better than you'd think given his size and the ORGANIZATION were giving him a lot of time in right field during his debut, where his strong arm could play well.PERSON's bat has the chance to profile well at either the infield or outfield corner. Obviously, his value is greater if he can patrol the outfield, but his left-handed swing should carry him up the ladder regardless.",0
"Taken by the ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER pick in the NUMBER Rule NUMBER Draft, PERSON was then dealt by the ORGANIZATION to the GPE. He has a big-league caliber arm, even if he's a little light in the experience department. A Tommy PERSON surgery recipient who missed nearly all of the NUMBER season, PERSON returned full force in NUMBER with some extremely electric stuff. The ball comes out of his hands really well, with an easy delivery that brings plus fastballs to the plate in a hurry. PERSON's fastball has touched NUMBER mph and sits in the mid-NUMBERs with late life. He combines it with a slider that has the chance to be at least PERSON average. PERSON has some command issues, not surprising given the limited time he's been on the mound, but has the mechanics to improve on that front over time. PERSON has the kind of stuff that could work very well in a closing role one day, perhaps following the ORGANIZATION professional path. That path was slowed with shoulder tendinitis that shelved him for more than two months in NUMBER.",1
"PERSON entered the NUMBER season seemingly ready for a big league job, but there was no room on the ORGANIZATION' Opening Day roster. Then PERSON had problems with blurry vision that caused him to get off to a bad start and miss the entire month of May. He bounced back in June, regaining his power stroke, before being dealt to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION trade in July. His hands, range and arm, the last of which being his best defensive tool, all play very well at third, though he's seen time at first and in the outfield as well. PERSON may not hit for a really high average, and fans should be prepared for a good amount of strikeouts, but he'll also draw a ton of walks and is a better all-around hitter than many anticipated. The power is legit, too, and it's not a projection. Assuming healthy, he should be ready to hit in GPE PERSON soon.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON passed up seven figures from the ORGANIZATION out of an ORGANIZATION high school to go to ORGANIZATION and got many times more than that three years later as the fifth overall pick. He's a near ideal combination of frame, arm action, delivery, athleticism, broad repertoire, and feel for pitching. PERSON's fastball is solid, but not a standout swing-and-miss pitch, though his slider often is. PERSON mixes in a curveball and changeup that are tertiary options and his lower slot matches the sinker/slider combo a bit better. His best route to early big league success may be to lean on his breaking ball and throw it as often as his fastball, like PERSON or PERSON do. Given the ORGANIZATION young pitching depth, there may not be a rotation spot for PERSON, but his stuff and approach would definitely work in a multi-inning relief role until that spot is available.",0
"A shortstop while playing high school ball in GPE, PERSON is an outstanding athlete who was also a football standout before focusing on baseball. While he might have had the range to stay at shortstop, he didnât have quite enough arm, so the ORGANIZATION moved him to the outfield immediately after he signed. His outstanding speed, close to plus, played well, and he adjusted to his new defensive home and could be an above-average center fielder in time. He has some ability with the bat, with a smooth swing that should allow him to hit for average. Heâs a high-energy player whoâs fun to watch and has more power potential than youâd think for a guy his size. Heâll need to make some adjustments, but he has the tools to be an intriguing top-of-the-order, center-field prospect to watch in the coming years.",0
"PERSON was a Spring Training sensation for the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER and appeared on the verge of reaching ORGANIZATION. But he never did reach the GPE, as he missed most of NUMBER and all of 'NUMBER following PERSON surgery. After he returned to the mound in 'NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION traded him to the ORGANIZATION during the offseason. Before he got hurt, PERSON showed the potential for three plus pitches. His velocity returned in NUMBER, as his fastball again consistently reached NUMBER mph. He also got swings and misses with his curveball and changeup, and also has begun to mix in a slider. While PERSON bounced back well in NUMBER, he still needs to prove he can throw enough strikes to realize his ceiling as a starter. If he can do so, he could quickly reach the Major Leagues with his new club.",0
"PERSON hit .NUMBER and .NUMBER as a freshman and sophomore, respectively, and then grew into a grade of power in his junior year while maintaining his contact skills and taking advantage of pitchers' newfound hesitancy to attack him in the zone. None of his tools are especially loud, but PERSON does several things fairly well and he has a slight chance to play a passable center field. He's one of the more stable college bats in the second/third round range.",0
"A second-round pick out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE in NUMBER, GPE did a lot of good things during his first full season, leading the organization in ORGANIZATION and finishing top five in wins, strikeouts and batting average against. For him to remain a starting pitcher long term, the right-hander will have to refine some things along the way.GPE is a big, strong power pitcher who relies on a very good fastball that sits NUMBER-NUMBER mph with heavy sink. He gets a ton of ground-ball outs from it and can reach back for extra velocity to miss bats. His slider is a wipeout pitch at times, but isn't always consistent. GPE has a curve that he likes to throw, but he tends to use it at the wrong time and the Tigers have talked about shelving it so he can focus on developing his slider. His changeup has the chance to be a Major League average pitch in the future. To stay in a rotation, GPE will have to continue to tighten up his secondary stuff and find the strike zone more consistently. Worst-case, his sinker-slider combination could work very well in shorter stints out of the bullpen.",0
"Scouts like PERSON because his tools play in games now and he projects to be an even better player as he develops.PERSON can run. He's been known to get from home to first base in four seconds flat, and he runs a NUMBER.NUMBER second NUMBER-yard dash. Some question his throwing accuracy and strength, but it's been described as average to below average, which is good for a player his age. He glides to balls in the outfield, often making a difficult play look easy.PERSON can hit, too. He rarely strikes out and he's been praised for his approach at the plate.

His pure speed is his best tool, grading as a legitimate plus. PERSON's wheels also give him plenty of range in center field, and he has a better arm than most players at that position. He began the long climb to the big leagues in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League this summer.",0
"The Marlins haven't been big international spenders in recent years, but the team appears to have a potential gem in PERSON, whom they signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in July NUMBER. Assigned directly to the GPE last summer for his professional debut, the right-hander opened eyes with an impressive showing in the ORGANIZATION Coast League.PERSON already operates in the low NUMBERs with his fastball and should gain more velocity as he continues to grow into his projectable frame. His slider shows the makings of becoming an above-average pitch, pairing nicely with his heater, and he also features a changeup that's currently a work in progress. PERSON already does a good job flooding the zone with strikes, and that should improve with more consistent mechanics.Though raw and inexperienced, PERSON profiles the ceiling of a No. NUMBER starter at maturity thanks to his combination of size and stuff.",0
"A projectable, athletic left-hander, GPE draws comparisons to a young PERSON and modeled his delivery after him. He'll get a chance to one day join him in the PERSON rotation after the ORGANIZATION drafted him NUMBERth overall and signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER last June. The club plans on bringing him along slowly and had him pitch just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in his pro debut.GPE has the potential for three solid-or-better pitches. His fastball currently sits around NUMBER mph and tops out at NUMBER, but he figures to add more velocity when he gets stronger and already misses a lot of bats because it features a high spin rate that creates riding life. His curveball has downer action when he stays on top of it and could turn into a plus offering if it adds more power as expected, and his changeup has similar upside but less consistency.GPE has a sound delivery and uses a high three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane. He does a good job of repeating his mechanics, though his command still wavers, as is true of most young pitchers. If he can add the necessary polish, he could become the most well-rounded lefty starter among PERSON' deep group of southpaw mound prospects.",0
"ORGANIZATION, a ORGANIZATION commit, played well on the showcase circuit last summer and was the winning pitcher in the championship game of the ORGANIZATION World Championship in October. But it was his performance this spring in the ORGANIZATION high school ranks that sent him shooting up ORGANIZATION boards.ORGANIZATION has a powerful right arm and has touched NUMBER mph with his fastball this spring. He more typically works in the low to mid NUMBERs but has room for additional strength gains in his lean frame. He has a pair of quality breaking balls, and his changeup has made strides to round out his full arsenal.Despite there being some effort in his delivery, ORGANIZATION generally works around the strike zone with all his pitches. He has a loose arm and good athleticism, which should help him clean up his delivery and pitch with better command as he gets more experience.",0
"Ever since PERSON began his pro career with the ORGANIZATION back in NUMBER, he has tantalized with his arm strength and raw stuff, though his performance hasn't always measured up. That's continued since he joined the ORGANIZATION courtesy of the PERSON deal at the NUMBER PERSON, though he did make his big league debut in NUMBER.PERSON still has an electric fastball, one that touches NUMBER mph at its peak. He can couple it with a power breaking ball that he's done a better job of landing for strikes and can serve as an out pitch. His changeup will flash above-average at times, but like with the success of him using his impressive arsenal, it hasn't been consistent. He threw more strikes in NUMBER, but was hit more and didn't miss as many bats as he should given his stuff.For years, there's been talk about moving PERSON to the bullpen because of his power arsenal and overall command issues. It might be time to make that move, in which case he could impact the big league relief corps soon. Even if he continues starting for now, it would be easy enough to shorten him up and let that fastball-slider combination play up.",1
"Coming out of high school in NUMBER, PERSON was an interesting southpaw with excellent fastball command, a solid curve and the kind of pitching frame you like to see. He looked like the kind of prep lefty who could move more quickly than some other young arms. It hasn't exactly worked out that way. PERSON was a starter during his pro debut in NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION, but he pitched almost exclusively out of the bullpen in NUMBER. He threw well in that role, albeit at age NUMBER in the GPE. He still has similar stuff, along with the potential for an average changeup. In a relief role, his stuff may play up and he could start moving more quickly.",0

He struggled at times in the ORGANIZATION during his pro debut but still showed the ability to impact games in a variety of ways, finishing second on the team in doubles (NUMBER), home runs (NUMBER), walks (NUMBER) and stolen bases (NUMBER).PERSON's bat speed and strength give him well-above-average raw power from the left side of the plate, and he already shows the ability to get to it during games. He's at his best when he stays short to the ball and uses the whole field, and the GPE have worked to get him into a better position to hit. And while strikeouts may always be a part of his game, PERSON impressed club officials during his pro debut with his ability and willingness to coax walks.PERSON is a standout athlete with slightly above-average speed, although he's likely to lose a step or two as he fills out physically. It's also why PERSON, a center fielder in high school, is best suited to play right field in pro ball, where he profiles as an average defender with a plus arm.

"There is no question that PERSON is ready to defend behind the plate at the big league level.

With his glove work, that should be enough to land him a big league job of some sort, though there isn't room behind the plate in GPE right now.",1
"The best teenaged prospect to come out of GPE since PERSON in NUMBER, PERSON sparked a bidding war among teams that landed him a $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus from the ORGANIZATION. That's the largest bonus ever given to an amateur player, eclipsing the $NUMBER.NUMBER million (deferred over NUMBER years) Aroldis PERSON got from the Reds in NUMBER. Factor in the matching $NUMBER.NUMBER million penalty that PERSON had to pay for exceeding its international bonus pool, and the total outlay for his services was $NUMBER million.PERSON offers more offensive potential than most middle infielders. He's a switch-hitter with electric bat speed who makes consistent hard contact from both sides of the plate. He could deliver a .NUMBER average and NUMBER-NUMBER homers on an annual basis, and he also has the well above-average speed to be a significant basestealing threat.PERSON primarily played second and third base in GPE while also seeing time at shortstop and in center field. His strong arm can play anywhere on the diamond, and the consensus among scouts is that he fits best at second base. He's young and may need a couple of years in the Minors, but he looks like a star who will be worth the wait.",1
"PERSON was enjoying a breakout season in NUMBER before he was suspended NUMBER games for testing positive for amphetamines. He came back to perform well in the ORGANIZATION and the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the trade that sent PERSON and ORGANIZATION to the A's in January. He was on the move again in November, heading to ORGANIZATION in a six-player deal that sent big leaguers PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to PERSON Bay.While PERSON draws praise for his ability to play bigger than his size and his tools, his physical ability shouldn't be sold short. He has solid speed and center-field skills, though he's seen time in all three outfield spots in NUMBER, and he has shown an advanced approach at the plate. PERSON's doesn't produce much power, but he doesn't strike out much and draws plenty of walks. Having success against higher levels of pitching, PERSON now looks like he could develop into a big league regular, perhaps a No. NUMBER type catalyst in the lineup.",0
"GPE saved a school-record NUMBER games in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION State before having some success as a starter in the ORGANIZATION, which prompted the ORGANIZATION to move him into their rotation in NUMBER. He went just NUMBER-NUMBER with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA, falling all the way to the NUMBERth round of the Draft after his stuff backed up. The FACILITY immediately returned him to the bullpen and watched him rise to Triple-A by June of his second full season.After seeing his fastball drop to the low NUMBERs and lose some life when he started, GPE is back working with a mid-NUMBERs fastball that touches NUMBER and features hard sink. His hard slider can reach NUMBER mph and is a plus pitch at its best. He'll even flash an average changeup at times and will work on refining it and using it more often after left-handers teed off on him in Double-A last year.GPE looked tentative when he first got to Double-A in NUMBER but has done a better job of attacking hitters this season. He can look like a future closer on his best days and is on the verge of bolstering GPE's bullpen.",1
"ORGANIZATION of GPE shortstop PERSON created most of the buzz on campus in NUMBER, and was a first-round pick. But PERSON more than made a name for himself with a consistent performance as the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter, resulting in his fourth-round selection.PERSON moved around during his college career, starting at ORGANIZATION, moving to PERSON as a sophomore, then moving to GPE for his junior year. He might not have wow stuff, but what he has was really good in NUMBER, all coming from an easy, simple delivery. He pitches off his fastball, which is a tick above-average sitting in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, and it plays up because of his feel for the strike zone. His slider has been a bit inconsistent, but he's shown it can be a solid breaking ball in the past. His changeup needs some refinement and looks kind of like a hybrid splitter-type pitch. PERSON will need to improve his third pitch to continue to have success at the pro level, but he has the makings of a solid, innings-eating starter.",0
"GPE homered NUMBER times in his final NUMBER games at ORGANIZATION, winning LOCATION tournament ORGANIZATION honors after going deep five times in five days, including a three-homer game against GPE. He finished with NUMBER homers after totaling six in his first two years with the ORGANIZATION, bashing his way into the sixth round of the NUMBER Draft. After signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER, GPE homered in three of his first four games as a pro.As a first baseman with big left-handed power along with swing-and-miss concerns, GPE earns comparisons to a poor man's PERSON. With his bat speed and the size and leverage his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound frame provides, he can crush the ball out of any part of the park. While GPE may never hit for a high average, he has shown a greater willingness to use the entire field and has made more contact in NUMBER.All of GPE's value comes from his bat. A high school catcher who played some right field as an ORGANIZATION sophomore, he'll be limited to first base as a pro because of his well-below-average speed. GPE can become an adequate defender but will need to improve his consistency.",0
"If ever there were an athletic contest in which players from across multiple leagues had to compete against one another in all of their respective sports, PERSON would be a top five pick. An athletic deity in high school, PERSON was a star in every sport. He was an <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaSwXNUMBERpJsINUMBER' target='_blank'>acrobatic dunker</a> and a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNUMBERqRgoGQXNUMBERM' target='_blank'>dominant open-field runner</a>, who was signed away from a football commitment to GPE for $NUMBER.NUMBER million. For much of his pro career, PERSON has either been hurt or underperformed. Aside from his .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER season in NUMBER, he has struggled to make contact, especially in NUMBER, when he struck out in NUMBER% of his plate appearances, and a minor league leading NUMBER times. Despite this, PERSON nearly posted yet another NUMBER/NUMBER season and improved so much as a defensive player that he's now considered plus in center. The PERSON sent him to the ORGANIZATION with a desire to see some kind of bat-to-ball improvement. PERSON responded by ditching his leg kick. His strikeout rate in GPE was NUMBER% -- better than the summer, but still not great -- and he hit for almost no power there. His issues with strikeouts weren't, in our opinion, caused by excessive movement in his swing but rather by things like breaking ball recognition, bat path, and hand-eye coordination. Those aren't things that can be remedied by mechanical changes, and we'd rather an athlete like this be moving a lot at the plate to help ensure he's getting to as much of that power as possible, even if it means living with a lot of strikeouts. There's a wide range of outcomes possible for a talent like this, ranging from PERSON to PERSON to B.J. PERSON to PERSON to PERSON. PERSON is a premium athlete with good makeup who should get plenty of opportunity to cure his own ills at the big league level. We think he's likely to be frustrating, but reasonably valuable, and possibly have some star-level seasons in his late twenties.",0
"Playing his high school baseball in the panhandle of GPE, GPE hasn't gotten a ton of exposure or instruction. He's been all over the map in terms of performance, but his size and raw stuff should make him an intriguing prospect as the ORGANIZATION winds on.Big and strong, GPE looks the part on the mound, and his arm works really well. He's been clocked up to NUMBER mph and sits comfortably in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with heavy sink. His power NUMBER-to-NUMBER curveball has late bite and has the chance to be pus. He has some feel for the changeup, but he doesn't use it much. His delivery gets out of balance often and, as a result, his control lags well behind his stuff.  When he's right, everything he throws is downhill and he looks like a future mid-rotation starter. When he's not, he's up in the zone and looks like a reliever. A team that believes the flaws are correctable could roll the dice on his upside in the top five rounds.",0
"Discovered in the ORGANIZATION after he slipped under draft radars for various reasons (including an early-career TJ), PERSON was signed as an undrafted free agent and, a year later, has reached theupper-levels of the minors. He has your typical, two-pitch middle relief look.",0
"PERSON parlayed a fine junior season at Louisiana-Lafayette that saw him help lead his team to a ORGANIZATION into a NUMBERth-round selection by the ORGANIZATION. The right-handed-hitting outfielder has shown some glimpses of the offensive abilities that stood out at Louisiana-Lafayette. PERSON isn't the biggest guy in the world, but he's strong and compact and is capable of making loud contact at times. There is some raw power for him to tap into, and he's worked on refining his aggressive approach at the plate to reach it more, though there still is a good amount of swing-and-miss to his game. He's an average runner and defender, and he saw time at all three outfield spots during his full-season debut in NUMBER.Most see PERSON as a left fielder in the future, or perhaps a fourth-outfielder type. If he can rein in the strikeouts, he has the chance to be an offensive contributor in either role.",0
"PERSON has done nothing but impress since the ORGANIZATION signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. In his stateside debut last season, the NUMBER-year-old tore up the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League to force a promotion to Class A Short-Season Auburn, where he was the youngest everyday player in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. PERSON' stock has continued to soar this year in his full-season debut, as he was promoted to Class A Advanced Potomac after just NUMBER games with PERSON. PERSON is a potentially special talent who showcases all five tools along with elite athleticism on a daily basis. He shows the makings of a plus hit tool, thanks to his compact but explosive swing and feel for using the whole field, and scouts rave about his advanced approach and strike-zone judgment. A plus-plus runner, PERSON' speed enables him impact games on the bases as well as in center field, where he has range for days in all directions and arm strength that's among the best in the Minors at the position.Beyond the athleticism and physical tools, the ORGANIZATION love PERSON' makeup and overall baseball aptitude, both of which make him a leader in the clubhouse. He might still be a few years away from reaching the ORGANIZATION, but there is reason to be excited about the kind of player he could become.",1
"As a sophomore, PERSON moved back and forth between pitching on Fridays and PERSON. In his junior season, the right-hander has been PERSON's Friday night ace all year and has been one of the more consistent college pitchers on the LOCATION this season.After a strong performance over the summer on the GPE, PERSON came out of the gate this spring pitching extremely well and helping his profile. Even as he's leveled off a bit, he's continued to perform, albeit in a slightly weaker LOCATION Conference. With a very quick arm, he delivers his fastball lin the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. His secondary stuff isn't quite as good, but his hard slider can be an out pitch at times and he'll mix in a curve and changeup as well. While some worry that his arm is too quick and that effort in his delivery could mean a move to a bullpen, he's shown the ability to maintain velocity deep into starts.PERSON is also an excellent athlete, reminding some of D-backs prospect PERSON. That should help him repeat his delivery consistently and give him the chance to reach his ceiling as a mid-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON has an unusually deep repertoire for a pitcher who scouts overwhelmingly project into the bullpen. He has a two seamer, a four seamer that has natural cut to it when he locates to his glove side, a slider (his best pitch dating back to college), and a changeup which has been the focal point of development since PERSON entered pro ball. A casualty of GPE's ability to recruit and develop pitching, PERSON was a college reliever who would've been starting on just about every other college team in the country, so there's a reason he lacks some of the finer attributes scout want to see from a starter. He could be an inefficient No. NUMBER/NUMBER, but he might be really good in a multi-inning relief role where he throws NUMBER or more innings.",0
"PERSON had an unexpected power breakout at Hi-A in NUMBER, hitting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER before going down with a mid-July injury. His hands work well, but he's otherwise a pretty stiff-legged athlete. If he can be an inoffensive defender at second and third, then perhaps PERSON can play a ORGANIZATION type of role as a somewhat versatile part time bat.",0
"PERSON pitched to a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA over NUMBER appearances out of GPE's bullpen as a true freshman and was off to a strong start in NUMBER before undergoing PERSON surgery. After making a healthy return and turning another strong relief campaign as a redshirt sophomore, PERSON was moved into the ORGANIZATION' rotation in NUMBER and excelled in the new role, going NUMBER-NUMBER with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in NUMBER starts en route to GPE Athletic Conference pitcher of the year honors. The ORGANIZATION took him in the NUMBERth round that June and used him as a swingman in his pro debut before shifting PERSON back to a full-time bullpen role for his first full season. It proved a wise decision, as he quickly climbed three levels, reaching the Double-A ORGANIZATION in mid-July before he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.PERSON is capable of bumping NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball but usually sits more in the low-NUMBERs, with the pitch playing on account of some funk in his delivery and because he hides the ball well on the backside. His slider is his lone above-average secondary pitch and makes him lethal on same-sided hitters, but he also has a good changeup that he uses to neutralize righties. He can throw strikes and miss bats with all three pitches, and hitters generally have trouble squaring him up. PERSON has been particularly effective against left-handed hitters early in his career thanks to his combination of stuff and deception, but he also shown that he can get outs on both sides of the plate while consistently inducing weak contact. Those traits suggest that he could be more than simply a situational left-hander out of the 'pen, although a ORGANIZATION role likely represents his clearest path to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"An under-the-radar international signing in February NUMBER, PERSON has been a bit of a long-term project for the PERSON' player development staff. It has taken the toolsy outfielder a while to start tapping into his potential, spending two years in the ORGANIZATION and two more in the Rookie-level PERSON and PERSON before making it to full-season ball in NUMBER. Repeating that level to start the NUMBER season has agreed with him, as he's off to a very good start.PERSON is a plus athlete, one with strength and speed reminiscent of two-sport standouts who played football and baseball as amateurs in the GPE. His plus speed works on both sides of the ball, with the ability to steal bases and cover ground in the outfield, where he's settled in to right field. The switch-hitter has made strides at the plate, with a much better line-drive rate in NUMBER. He's always been willing to draw walks, but he's finding good pitches to drive, which should help him tap into his raw power.The PERSON will undoubtedly continue to be patient with PERSON's development. He might be a fourth outfielder when all is said and done, but don't rule out seeing him blossom into a solid all-around regular, with his NUMBER breakout perhaps not an aberration.",0
"Like PERSON, PERSON might be a catcher and might hit enough to be useful elsewhere. A ORGANIZATION second-round choice in NUMBER, he came to GPE in a trade last July for PERSON and PERSON's a safer bet to catch than Schwarber, though PERSON is far from a finished product behind the plate. His to-do list includes softening his hands, improving his throwing accuracy, refining his blocking skills and adding strength to better handle the physical demands of the position. His Plan B is third base, where he has shown in the past that he's a capable defender with a strong arm.PERSON could hit enough for third base but might not have the power desired there. He's a switch-hitter whose swing from both sides is geared more to line-drive contract than driving the ball. He has a quality approach at the plate and could have close to average power from the left side.",0
"At ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall, PERSON was the second catcher selected in the NUMBER Draft, behind only PERSON's Reese ORGANIZATION. The LOCATION prepster has a good understanding of the game, and he adjusted well to the ORGANIZATION Leagues.At the plate, PERSON has an up-the-middle approach, and he produces good bat speed. Big and strong, he has solid power potential.Behind the plate, PERSON isn't afraid to take charge and be a leader. He has a strong arm and has improved his receiving skills, though they still need some work. PERSON is a long way from the big leagues, but he has the tools to become a Major Leaguer in time.",0
"Originally signed in Oct. NUMBER, PERSON's career didn't get off to a great start as he was suspended in March NUMBER for NUMBER games following a positive drug test for metabolites of GPE. He did make his pro debut that summer in the ORGANIZATION and spent his first two seasons pitching solely in relief. He first got the chance to start in NUMBER, with mixed results and while the GPE League was tough for him in his first tour as a full-time starter in NUMBER, he did get a late bump up to Double-A and led the organization in strikeouts.PERSON's out pitch is a slider that flashes plus, a real difference-maker that misses bats. His fastball plays up because it has solid life, with run and sinking action to it. His changeup lags behind the other two offerings, but it made progress during the NUMBER season as he threw it more. While he's always had a high strikeout rate, NUMBER.NUMBER per nine, in his career, he has struggled with his command, both within and outside of the strike zone. That led to a spike in walk and hit rates in NUMBER.While he is undersized at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, PERSON has a lot of strength and is able to maintain his stuff deep into outings. Despite the control issues, and because of the development of all of his pitches in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION think he has the chance to be a starter at the big league level.",0
"PERSON made waves in NUMBER, his first full professional season. But his follow-up campaign was brought to an abrupt halt by a collision in the second game of the season that forced him to undergo PERSON surgery and a procedure to repair a microfracture in his wrist. He got back on the field in time for the ORGANIZATION, where he played well.  When he's healthy, PERSON has never had a problem hitting. He generates impressive bat speed and big power. While there's always going to be some swing-and-miss in his game, he understands the strike zone and knows how to draw a walk.  Originally a third baseman, PERSON has moved across the diamond to first base. That puts more pressure on him to hit, but, so far, he's shown that won't be a problem.",0
"PERSON hit five homers in three seasons at ORGANIZATION and five more in his first two years as a pro after signing for an over-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER as an eighth-rounder in NUMBER. He broke out with NUMBER last season, including NUMBER in the second half after a promotion to Triple-A. He had bat speed and strength, but he also entered pro ball with an inside-out right-handed swing and it took him time to learn to get his bat head out front.PERSON already had established himself as one of the better hitters in the system, showing good hand-eye coordination and not trying to do too much at the plate. His newfound power made pitchers respect him more, with his walk rate jumping from NUMBER percent in NUMBER to NUMBER percent last year. He burnished his case to become an everyday player by continuing to perform at the plate in NUMBER, impressing in his first month in GPE before tearing an adductor muscle in July.A good athlete for his size, PERSON gets average to solid grades for his speed and arm strength. He broke into pro ball as an outfielder, moved to second base and also saw action at shortstop in his first full season, then returned to the outfield last year. He fits best in left field, especially at ORGANIZATION&T PERSON, and can handle spot duty in center and right.",1
"PERSON spent three years in GPE ball after he signed with the ORGANIZATION out of GPE in NUMBER. He went straight to the Class A Advanced level for his full-season debut in NUMBER, where he ranked among the GPE League leaders in hitting when he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION in a prospect package for PERSON. After having his NUMBER campaign was cut short after he fractured his right elbow while sliding in GPE, PERSON returned fully healthy in NUMBER and was named to the ORGANIZATION Mid-Season All-Star squad. PERSON stands out more for his floor than his ceiling, as he's a well-rounded player who projects to have four average-or-better tools. A right-handed hitter, he makes consistent contact with a flat path through the zone, with barrel control that allows him to spray the ball from line to line. Though he rarely strikes out, PERSON can be aggressive to a fault at times and will need to develop more selectivity as he continues to progress through the Minors. PERSON's average speed stands out most at shortstop, and he has the necessary range, footwork and arm strength to remain there long term. Yet, despite having all of the defensive tools to become a big-league regular at shortstop, it will be up to PERSON's bat to make good on the projection.",1
"A three-year member of GPE's rotation, PERSON is the epitome of the college performer without plus stuff. After a heavy workload with the ORGANIZATION, he didn't pitch much in his summer debut, then went back to campus to work toward earning his degree. He was ready to go in NUMBER, pitching across three levels, including Triple-A. Following the season, the ORGANIZATION dealt him, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON Ozuna.PERSON is all about command and control, with three pitches that routinely play above their modest grades. His fastball sits in the low-NUMBERs, touching NUMBER mph, but he throws it downhill with good life and excellent command, allowing it to play up. He keeps hitters honest with a good cutter in the upper NUMBERs and knows how to effectively change speed with his changeup and curveball, with the former currently ahead of the latter. With a clean and repeatable delivery, he throws a ton of strikes and consistently works down in the zone.PERSON is the prototypical low ceiling, high floor kind of prospect, a safe bet to reach a big league rotation. What spot remains to be seen, but he is the type to overachieve and pitch beyond his stuff.",1
"A product of junior college powerhouse PERSON, PERSON was drafted in the NUMBERth round by the ORGANIZATION back in NUMBER. The D-backs, who had drafted the left-hander the year prior, brought him into the fold at the NUMBER PERSON in the ORGANIZATION deal. A strong NUMBER season raised expectations for NUMBER, but while PERSON did make his big league debut, he had a tough year overall before PERSON acquired him as part of a three-team trade with the ORGANIZATION in February. After a solid start to PERSON's season between Triple-A and the Majors, it was announced in early June that the lefty would require PERSON surgery.PERSON had trouble finding a rhythm during the NUMBER season as he rode the PERSON-Arizona shuttle at times, often getting thrown from his routine. That did not help him learn to deal with the struggles he faced, both in the tough pitching environment of PERSON and in the big leagues. There's still a lot to like about PERSON's stuff, though, starting with a fastball that was up to NUMBER mph pitching in relief at the end of the year. He could settle into the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range when all is said and done. His curveball flashes plus, but it was inconsistent at times last year, and he has good enough feel for his changeup to envision it eventually being consistently average.While PERSON remained around the strike zone, his command within it suffered, making him much too hittable. He's still young enough to reach his potential as a mid-rotation starter, though, as PERSON will be in his age-NUMBER season when he returns to the mound in mid-NUMBER.",1
"Not every prospect takes a straight and quick path to the big leagues. PERSON was originally signed by the ORGANIZATION in December NUMBER, but after two uneventful summers in the ORGANIZATION, he was first loaned, then sold to GPE in the ORGANIZATION. After five seasons of putting up numbers, both in the summer and winter leagues, the ORGANIZATION signed the infielder in January and he made quick work of Double-A, earning a bump to Triple-A in May.PERSON showed an ability to hit for average throughout his ORGANIZATION stay, hitting .NUMBER or better in four of his five seasons. He has a good approach at the plate, he draws walks and doesn't strike out much, all while showing surprising extra-base power for his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. Defensively, he's best suited for second base on a daily basis, but he has shown he can handle short or third when needed. The type who has consistently outperformed his tools, PERSON is a smart overachiever who fits a utility-type profile. The ORGANIZATION took a flier on him and it's looking like they may have found a future bench player for their big league roster.",0
"Gonsalves established himself as one of the best high school left-handers in this year's PERSON class with a strong showing with PERSON and on the showcase circuit. An inconsistent spring took some of the sheen off the ORGANIZATION native, but the Twins weren't scared off. Gonsalves has good stuff for a teenager, but it is thanks to his projectability that he was so highly sought after. Gonsalves is tall and lanky and has plenty of room to fill out his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. He throws his fastball in the upper-NUMBERs and regularly touches NUMBER mph. He also throws a split-finger, which operates as his changeup, and a curveball, which is still developing and sometimes gets slurvy. Gonsalves has a high ceiling, but he has a long way to go to reach it.",0
"The Pirates have had success signing talented players out of GPE, and they found another good one in PERSON. It'll be up to the ORGANIZATION to develop him, however, after they acquired him as a part of the August NUMBER deal for PERSON and PERSON Byrd.PERSON already has shown he has a good understanding of what to do at the plate. He has a balanced swing and he makes hard, consistent contact. PERSON generates surprising power from his compact frame, but he is at his best when he's hitting line drives to all fields.PERSON has a solid arm and he shows good infield actions. He is still improving as a second baseman, but he looks like he'll be an everyday big leaguer in time.",1
"In a system deep in power bullpen arms, PERSON has flown under the radar, partially because of injury issues. Coming back healthy in NUMBER has him set up to make more noise in NUMBER and beyond.Signed out of GPE in September NUMBER, PERSON first made the move to the bullpen in winter ball in his home country in NUMBER. He's been a reliever since, though he missed considerable time in NUMBER and the start of NUMBER with a shoulder impingement. The right-hander did avoid surgery, and the ORGANIZATION mostly wanted NUMBER to be about PERSON staying healthy. He did just that and put up good numbers as a bonus. PERSON misses plenty of bats with a fastball that sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. His best secondary offering is his changeup, while his curveball is inconsistent but has improved of late. The ORGANIZATION were encouraged with how PERSON threw at the end of the ORGANIZATION season in NUMBER, including eight scoreless innings in the playoffs, and feel PERSON has the chance to be a big league setup man in the future.",0
"PERSON was lightly used during his college career at GPE, throwing just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in three seasons. But that was more indicative of the Gators pitching depth than PERSON's talent. Though the physical left-hander throws four pitches, he relies mostly on his fastball-slider combination. His fastball sits in the low-NUMBERs with good tailing movement and his slider is a quality second pitch. PERSON was used exclusively as a reliever in college and the D-backs have kept him in the bullpen in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has a future at least as a left-handed specialist. But he has already proven to be effective against right-handed hitters as well as left-handers and could eventually become a setup man in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"A speedster shortstop with a punchy, low-impact swing, ORGANIZATION is unlikely to make any sort of offensive impact with his bat. His feet and range at shortstop are fine but his arm is fringey and he may have to move to center field. He likely won't hit enough to play every day wherever he ends up but he could be a speedy utility man.",0
"The younger brother of former GPE first-rounder PERSON, PERSON was known mostly for his defense and batted a combined .NUMBER during his first two years at ORGANIZATION. He broke out offensively as a junior in NUMBER, went in the fifth round to the ORGANIZATION and won the LOCATION MVP award in his debut after pacing the short-season circuit in hitting (.NUMBER), on-base percentage (.NUMBER), runs (NUMBER) and steals (NUMBER). After he was unable to build on that success in GPE Class A in NUMBER, PERSON sent him and right-hander PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for righty PERSON in March.A shorter swing helped PERSON make consistent contact and hit for a high average in his pro debut, but he deviated from that contact-oriented approach last season, often selling out in an attempt to pull the ball and hit for more power. His strikeout rate spiked as a result, especially during the second half of the season, while a low on-base rate kept PERSON from truly utilizing his well-above-average speed on the basepaths as he had in the previous year.Defensively, PERSON shouldn't have trouble sticking at shortstop, where he profiles as an above-average defender with soft hands, good range and an absolute cannon for an arm that earns him a NUMBER grade on the NUMBER-NUMBER scouting scale. Though he has much to prove at the plate, PERSON's wheels and defense should make him a big league contributor in some capacity.",0
"Originally signed by the ORGANIZATION out of GPE when he was NUMBER, PERSON was a key part of the package the ORGANIZATION received in exchange for PERSON in NUMBER. A two-time Futures Game participant, PERSON had lived up to expectations before torn ligaments in his left knee forced him to miss most of the NUMBER season.PERSON's game is built around speed. More of a slap hitter, he slashes balls the other way and lets his speed do the work to get on base. He is a threat to steal, and he has swiped NUMBER bases three times in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's speed helps him defensively as well. He has excellent range, soft hands and a strong arm. PERSON has the potential to be a ORGANIZATION Glove-caliber shortstop. PERSON returned in NUMBER looking to make up for lost time. Even after what amounted to a lost year, he is on the cusp of reaching the Major Leagues.",0
"GPE is a hard prospect to figure out. A great summer in the ORGANIZATION positioned him as a top-NUMBER pick in the NUMBER Draft before an extended slump as a ORGANIZATION junior dropped him to the second round. He reached Triple-A after two pro seasons and throws strikes with a solid repertoire, yet his upside is debatable because he has averaged a mere NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts per nine innings.GPE sits in the low NUMBERs with his fastball and runs it up to NUMBER mph. His best secondary pitch is his changeup, and he also has two hard breaking pitches. His slider isn't as sharp as it was in college and sometimes turns into more of a cutter, but it's more consistent than his curveball.Both his fastball and changeup feature sink but induce many more groundballs than strikeouts, while his breaking balls lack the depth to miss bats. He has the ingredients to be a No. NUMBER starter but a more realistic future as a back-of-the-rotation option.",1
"GPE has tried PERSON at several different positions over the last year in effort to get his bat to the big leagues more quickly, as his receiving behind the plate left something to be desired. As PERSON has tried to play third (last fall) and left field (this spring) he hass truggled, suddenly, to hit. He's been hot again of late and still projects as a plus bat who generates power on contact. He's aggressive and may not reach base at a high rate.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their eighth-round pick in the NUMBER Draft after an injury-plagued career at ORGANIZATION State that included a broken hand as a redshirt junior. Pegged by the organization as a breakout candidate ahead of his first full season, PERSON did just that by reaching the ORGANIZATION State League and finishing third in the system in batting average (.NUMBER) and fifth in stolen bases (NUMBER). The ORGANIZATION native then built upon the performance in NUMBER, hitting both for average and even some power as he climbed from Double-A to Triple-A. PERSON's best tool is his speed and it allows him to be a basestealing threat as well as a defensive asset in the outfield. He has played all three spots thus far, with his best chance to be a regular coming in center or left, where his fringy arm would be acceptable. He has shown a solid approach at the plate and a willingness to draw walks, and he added some power to his game in NUMBER with career-high totals in home runs (NUMBER) and doubles (NUMBER), albeit at the cost of more strikeouts (NUMBER). The ORGANIZATION continue to stress bunting as a tool to help him let his legs do the talking.PERSON profiles best as a fourth outfielder or bench presence, one whose speed can do a lot of things. If he can continue to refine his approach and get on base, he could be a table-setting type at the highest level.",0
"GPE's build is the draft's most apt example of nominative determinism but he's deceptively fast for his size and could play third for a while in pro ball, though he'll likely max out as a fringe defender there and will likely end up at first base eventually. He has plus bat speed, raw power, good feel for the barrel and can ID breaking balls but there's some swing and miss concern because of mechanical stiffness and a tendency to expand the zone.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION (Calif.) has produced NUMBER big leaguers, most notably PERSON, and PERSON's teammates there included PERSON third baseman J.D. PERSON, future first-round picks PERSON and PERSON, and slugging ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON. The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for an above-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBER sixth-rounder and shifted him from middle infielder to catcher after his pro debut. The transition behind the plate has gone well but his offensive numbers have declined each year since he moved behind the plate.With soft hands and more quickness than most catchers, PERSON has steadily improved into a solid receiver. He has arm strength to match and has gotten better with his transfer and accuracy. He impresses with his leadership skills as well, and there's no doubt that he'll be able to catch at the big league level. Whether he'll be able to hit is another question after he slid to .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER in Double-A last year, then went NUMBER-for-NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION. He has a nice left-handed stroke, the raw power to hit NUMBER homers per year and some patience, so there's hope. While he doesn't swing and miss excessively, pitchers goad him into a lot of weak contact to the opposite field.",1
"At the start of the NUMBER college season, PERSON was seen as a potential top of the GPE kind of prospect, especially after a strong sophomore season and summer pitching for the GPE National PERSON over the summer. Minor arthroscopic knee surgery kept him from fall ball and that clearly contributed to a sluggish start to his NUMBER season, though his stuff came back a bit as the spring progressed. The PERSON were thrilled when he fell to GPE. NUMBER overall, then watched him help pitch GPE to a ORGANIZATION World Series title before signing him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million.When he's going full strength, as he was at the end of the spring, PERSON's fastball will sit around NUMBER mph and will touch NUMBER mph consistently with good sink. His slider is a true out pitch, though he threw it a little too much in college. He showed a solid changeup more over the summer, with a good feel for a future Major League average offering. He's more control over command, but he stays around the strike zone.The PERSON went over pick value to sign PERSON, but only slightly. If the uneven start to his junior season was only a blip, they may have gotten a top NUMBER talent at a bargain rate.",0
"PERSON planned on defending its NUMBER College World Series championship with a weekend rotation of eventual first-round picks PERSON and PERSON plus PERSON, whom scouts held in nearly the same regard. But PERSON couldn't find the strike zone as a junior and got buried in the bullpen before the ORGANIZATION took a sixth-round flier on him in the NUMBER Draft. After walking nine of the NUMBER batters he faced in his pro debut, he has done a better job of throwing strikes this summer. PERSON has a pair of power pitches, starting with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball with good run and sink. His mid-NUMBERs slider can be a plus pitch at its best. He also dabbles with a changeup that will need a lot more refinement if PERSON wants to try him as a starter. For now, the ORGANIZATION are letting PERSON slowly rebuild his confidence by using him as a multi-inning reliever. The bullpen might be the best destination for him anyway, because he'll never have fine command and has yet to show aptitude for throwing an offspeed pitch. If he can throw enough strikes, he has the stuff to become a set-up man.",0
"PERSON hurt his elbow during his senior season of high school and dropped to the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft. The injury ultimately required PERSON surgery, sidelining him for the whole NUMBER season. He got back on the mound the next year, throwing NUMBER innings between Rookie-level Bluefield and short-season Vancouver. PERSON quickly recovered his stuff following surgery. His fastball peaks at NUMBER mph with good life. He has some feel for his changeup, while his breaking ball still needs more work. He's smoothed out his delivery since being drafted and fills up the strike zone with his whole arsenal. Even after being sidelined for a year, PERSON exhibits good polish and understanding of his craft. He'll look to build on his early success as he gets further away from his surgery.",0
"Originally signed by the ORGANIZATION in December NUMBER, PERSON spent his first two pro seasons in the ORGANIZATION before graduating to full-season ball at age NUMBER in NUMBER. Following the season, the ORGANIZATION shipped him off to GPE along with PERSON in exchange for PERSON. After pitching out of the bullpen exclusively to begin his career, PERSON made the transition to starting last summer with encouraging results, and he furthered his success in NUMBER. In GPE, the ORGANIZATION sent PERSON and first baseman PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. He was traded back to GPE a few days later for ORGANIZATION, who suffered an elbow injury in his first start for the ORGANIZATION. He was on the move again in January, when he was part of a three-player package sent to the Reds in return for PERSON Straily.PERSON has a power arm, one that generates a consistent high-NUMBERs fastball that routinely touches triple digits. His slider is his best secondary offering and flashes plus potential with excellent depth, and he also has the makings of a quality changeup that could prove to be a weapon against left-handed hitters. Meanwhile, he has shown better strike-throwing ability as a starter while continuing to generate ground balls at a high rate.Though still relatively new to starting, PERSON made strides with both his pitchability and durability last season, suggesting that he might be able to stick in the role. If not, the hard-throwing right-hander certainly has the stuff to become a late-inning force out of the bullpen.",0
"PERSON intrigued scouts as a GPE high schooler in NUMBER, but his ORGANIZATION commitment and rough delivery left him undrafted. He pitched sparingly for the ORGANIZATION as a freshman before academic ineligibility prompted his transfer to GPE (Fla.) JC for NUMBER. He won ORGANIZATION Pitcher honors at the ORGANIZATION World Series, helping the Indians capture their second national title and then signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a supplemental second-round choice.PERSON's NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame and low three-quarters delivery allow him to make lefties uncomfortable and get in on the hands of righties. He throws sinking two-seam fastballs in the low NUMBERs and running four-seamers that can reach NUMBER, both of which play up because of the difficult angle his size and arm slot create. His sweeping slider and changeup show flashes of becoming solid secondary offerings but still lack consistency.Though he generally throws strikes, PERSON will need to improve his command to remain a starter in pro ball. He missed a month during the spring with a blood clot and worked a combined NUMBER innings in two college seasons, so he'll need to establish he can hold up over a full pro season. If he's not durable enough to remain a starter, he could be an interesting bullpen option.",0
"The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the fourth round of the NUMBER GPE, making him the highest-drafted player to come out of GPE. The top ORGANIZATION II prospect in his GPE class, he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER, made his pro debut at ORGANIZATION A Short-Season Tri-City and then earned All-Star honors while finishing sixth in the batting race (.NUMBER) at ORGANIZATION A Fort Wayne in first full season. He made even greater strides at the plate with PERSON in NUMBER, when he finished fourth in the GPE League with NUMBER home runs and third with a .NUMBER slugging percentage. A left-handed hitter with bat speed and strength, PERSON is an offensive-minded backstop who knows how to drive the ball and projects to hit for power and some average. He has a knack for making hard contact to all fields and does a good job controlling the strike zone, though he did experience a nearly NUMBER-percent jump in his strikeout rate with the move up to PERSON Elsinore.While PERSON's large frame continues to raise questions among evaluators about whether he can stay behind the plate long term, club officials were pleased with the progress he made in NUMBER after working with catching instructor PERSON. He has decent hands and some raw arm strength, but his receiving skills are below average and he needs to improve his catch-and-throw skills after throwing out just NUMBER.NUMBER percent of attempted basestealers in three professional seasons.",0
"PERSON had an impressive first full professional season, pitching well across two levels in NUMBER. And perhaps most importantly, he stayed healthy after a checkered injury history as an amateur dinged his stock leading up to the 'NUMBER PERSON. PERSON hasn't been as fortunate this year, as hamstring and calf issues sidelined him early.PERSON's fastball sits in the low NUMBERs, and it is most effective when he keeps it down in the zone. He has a good feel for his hard curveball, which is an effective out pitch. PERSON rounds out his three-pitch mix with a solid changeup.At his best, PERSON pounds the strike zone and shows the ability to command all of his pitches well. He earned praise for his pitchability, and he looked the part of an advanced college pitcher at the outset of his professional career. PERSON profiles as a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"The first of four high school pitchers selected by the ORGANIZATION in the top five rounds of the NUMBER Draft, PERSON has one of the best combinations of stuff and feel among the system's mound prospects. He projects as a potential No. NUMBER starter, with command of three average or better pitches.PERSON's best pitch is a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball, with the sink to generate plenty of groundouts. He spins a nice curveball, too, and he already has an effective changeup. PERSON is already starting to add strength, and he has the athleticism to repeat his delivery on a regular basis.PERSON finished his first full season with two dominant starts in the short-season LOCATION playoffs, which could be a harbinger of a breakout this year. If he can build on that progress, he could advance very quickly for a prep prospect.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION made the decision to blow well past their international bonus allocation for the NUMBER-NUMBER signing period, their four pool slots (used to determine their spending allowance) held little value to them. They traded all of them, sending three worth a total of $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON and infielder PERSON and the fourth to the ORGANIZATION for right-hander PERSON and outfielder PERSON. A second-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON jumped to high Class A after the deal and helped PERSON win the GPE League title.PERSON is more about polish than power, with his downer curveball qualifying as his lone above-average pitch. He gets good downhill plane on his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball, but the pitch lacks life and may not miss many bats at higher levels. His fringy changeup shows some fade and could improve if he used it more often. PERSON has good feel for pitching and always has filled the strike zone. He's an extreme flyball pitcher with a career NUMBER.NUMBER groundout/airout ratio, a cause for concern now that PERSON is playing as one of the best home run parks in the ORGANIZATION. There's still room for some projection in his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame, but unless he adds some power to his pitches his ceiling will be limited to GPE. NUMBER starter.",1
"PERSON was diagnosed with an elbow tear during his senior year at GPE (Ill.) High in NUMBER, but the ORGANIZATION gambled on him in the NUMBERth round of the ORGANIZATION and lured him away from a commitment to GPE with a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus. The left-hander ended up needing PERSON surgery and missed the entire NUMBER season, but he pitched well the following year, logging NUMBER innings between Rookie-level Bluefield and Class A Short PERSON. Unfortunately, injuries derailed what was supposed to be his first full campaign in NUMBER, when he experienced elbow soreness early in the season and was shut down in July with shoulder pain. PERSON has showed his pre-surgery stuff when healthy, highlighted by an NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that peaks at NUMBER and consistently plays up due to his deceptive delivery and long arms. His changeup is a plus pitch for which he's long demonstrated feel, while his breaking ball still needs more work. PERSON has cleaned up his delivery since being drafted and knows how to pound the zone with his entire arsenal. He has the ingredients to develop into a back-end starter, but, for now, it's more important that he stay healthy and gain experience.",0
"Since slipping to the middle of the first round of the NUMBER Draft because of a stress reaction in his back, the ORGANIZATION have understandably treated PERSON cautiously. He made a very brief debut that summer before having a minor procedure on his back, then held him back for his full-season debut until June. Once he got settled, he showed what all the fuss was about, throwing exceptionally well down the stretch and finishing with NUMBER shutout innings in the playoffs as PERSON captured the LOCATION title.PERSON's stuff was just as good as advertised when he was a top-of-the-Draft prospect before his injury. His fastball will sit in the low-NUMBERs, with the ability to reach back for a little more when needed. But what really makes it stand out is the cutter-like movement to it and his ability to command it well. PERSON has one of the better breaking balls in the Minors, a plus curve, and his changeup has improved and could be above-average, at least, in the future. His stuff plays up even more because of deception in his delivery and his outstanding command.With the back issue in the rear view mirror, the gloves came off for this talented left-hander. He jumped on a faster track to a future as a top half of a rotation starter with a double-jump to Double-A in NUMBER.",1
"Along with PERSON, his GPE Florida Christian teammate and fellow PERSON commit, PERSON has seen his stock increase this spring. PERSON' rise has been partly attributable to the strength gains he has made over the past year. That led to a jump in his fastball velocity, and he now throws the pitch in the low NUMBERs, regularly touching NUMBER mph. He also throws a solid NUMBER-to-NUMBER curveball and has a good feel for his changeup. He repeats his delivery well, allowing him to throw strikes with all three of his pitches. PERSON' strong season, size, stuff and projectability have helped push him up ORGANIZATION boards as more scouts see him pitch.",0
"PERSON was a part of a strong NUMBER ORGANIZATION class in GPE and played summer ball with eventual first-round picks PERSON and PERSON. PERSON wasn't far behind them in the ORGANIZATION and heard his own name called in the fifth round, two days before his NUMBERth birthday. For a young player, PERSON has shown an advanced feel at the plate and uses a quick, short swing to make consistent contact to all fields. He can be a patient hitter and has some raw power, though he's still learning how to tap into it during games. Defensively, PERSON has a chance to stay in center field. If he has to move to a corner, his strong arm would play well in right field, and he saw some time in left field during his professional debut. His bat has the chance to play no matter what position he settles in, but his development took a hit when a left elbow injury forced him out of action in early May.",0
"PERSON had better all-around tools than most college players and performed well with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION, but he never put up big numbers in three years at ORGANIZATION. PERSON weren't sure quite what to make of him, so he lasted six rounds in the NUMBER Draft. After he hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER and advanced to Double-A during his first full pro season, he looked like a steal, though his encore was marred by forearm and hamstring injuries this year.The ORGANIZATION had PERSON make an adjustment in the angle of his barrel so it wouldn't point toward the ground, which gave him a flatter and longer left-handed stroke and helped him see pitches better. He started hammering pitches he used to foul off and did a better job of coping with breaking balls. After translating his impressive raw power into just eight homers in three college seasons, he went deep NUMBER times last year, and he displayed his plate discipline by leading PERSON farmhands with NUMBER walks.PERSON can clock plus-plus running times but his speed doesn't play quite that fast. He should be a more prolific and successful basestealer, but he was caught NUMBER times in NUMBER attempts in NUMBER. He spent most of his college career in right field, in part because he has a strong arm, but played quality defense when he got extensive time in center last year.",0
"PERSON may have come off the board earlier in the NUMBER Draft if not for a bout of forearm tightness that sidelined him for three weeks as a high school senior. The ORGANIZATION were thrilled to find him still available with the NUMBERth-overall pick, and then signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million. PERSON rewarded the ORGANIZATION by dominating in his first two pro seasons and then reached Double-A at age NUMBER in NUMBER. However, it will now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further his development after they acquired PERSON and PERSON in the ORGANIZATION Lucroy-Jeremy Jeffress Trade Deadline blockbuster.PERSON combines stuff and feel better than most young pitchers. His strong build allows him to maintain his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball deep into ballgames, and his low-NUMBERs slider gives him a plus second pitch. PERSON threw his changeup sparingly as an amateur, but has developed it enough as a pro to where scouts view it as a potentially average pitch. Meanwhile, a clean and repeatable delivery has helped to make PERSON an accomplished strike-thrower early in his career.Much like GPE, PERSON impressed last summer in his brief ORGANIZATION debut, and he continued to do so in NUMBER, his first full year with the organization. He lacks projection in his physical NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame and needs to stay healthy, but PERSON has both the stuff and command profile to develop into a No. NUMBER starter.",1
"PERSON has one of the best NUMBER mph fastballs in the minors due to its dramatic sinking movement, which makes it capable of missing bats despite below-average velocity. His arm angle and the shape of his fastball create a pitch that looks very similar to PERSON's sinker, but with much less zip. Though the ORGANIZATION, who traded him to GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION deal, tried to develop PERSON as a starter early in his career, a combination of injury concern (bad delivery, flunked physical coming out of high school, TJ in college) and lack of control made it likely that he'd eventually move to the bullpen, and that transition -- or at least to a role where PERSON throws a number of innings typical of a reliever; he may be a candidate to 'open', but we don't know for sure -- is underway. PERSON used to live in the low-to-mid-NUMBERs and his drop in velocity is perhaps a red flag, considering his medical history. But it plays even at this velocity, and so do his two breaking balls, which benefit from the deceptive ugliness of his delivery.",0
"PERSON appeared on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION after PERSON made him the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION of GPE product slugged his way to Double-A in his first full season, when he led all ORGANIZATION Minor Leagues in home runs (NUMBER) and ORGANIZATION (NUMBER). He stalled back at that level in NUMBER, however, and then suffered a season-ending Achilles injury shortly after the ORGANIZATION tried to jumpstart his bat with a promotion to Triple-A. PERSON finally got back on track in NUMBER with a return to Double-A has continued to swing the bat well after being promoted to Triple-A in late June. When he's right, PERSON's right-handed swing is compact and straight to the ball, with necessary bat speed and loft to generate consistent over-the-fence power. But he became too pull-conscious after his impressive NUMBER campaign, and then lost some of his feel to hit last year as he tried to overcompensate and use the whole field. His formerly sound approach regressed as well, and some scouts wonder if his current bat path will ever allow him to drive secondary pitches. PERSON's strong arm was his only standout tool at third base, where he was below-average defender with limited range. As a result, he saw more time at first base last season before taking over there full time in NUMBER.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON spent his first five pro seasons and part of a sixth in GPE ball. After finally reaching Triple-A in late April, he cracked the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER-man roster in August with his first callup to the big leagues.Though PERSON has spent much of his ORGANIZATION career as a starter, he has a brighter future as a reliever. He usually works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph as part of a rotation, and he's reached NUMBER coming out of the bullpen. PERSON' No. NUMBER pitch is a hard cutter/slider that pushes the upper NUMBERs.PERSON has funky mechanics that often hamper his control and command. He shows some aptitude for a changeup and often throws it too hard, and he tips off his curveball by slowing down his delivery. PERSON might be better off by shifting to relief and focusing on his two best pitches.",1
"The start of PERSON's career began inauspiciously, as he had deals with two other clubs fall apart because of injury and age concerns. After he served a one-year suspension, the ORGANIZATION were able to sign him, albeit not in his teenage years. He made his GPE debut in NUMBER, putting up gaudy numbers in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. The injury concerns manifested themselves in NUMBER, and PERSON underwent PERSON surgery in June. When healthy, he has the best slider in the system, a future plus breaking ball with good late break. His fastball is above average, and his control, already solid, will continue to get better. Only his changeup is behind, but he's shown enough feel for it to instill confidence that it will be a Major League-average offering.",0
"GPE and projectable as an amateur, PERSON started his professional career slowly before breaking out to lead the GPE League in hitting in NUMBER. He has carried that success into full-season ball.Part of PERSON's breakout came as a result of a mechanical change he made in his swing and improving his approach at the plate. Those changes have allowed him to hit more line drives, but he'll need to better tap into his raw power as he advances in the ORGANIZATION.A shortstop in high school, PERSON initially moved to third base in the ORGANIZATION and has now settled at first base, partially in deference to PERSON. PERSON can be an above-average defender at his new position, though it puts more pressure on his bat.",0
"Back in July NUMBER, PERSON was No. NUMBER on MLB.com's Top NUMBER International prospects list heading into that summer's signing period. The top-ranked catcher in the class signed with the Phillies for $NUMBER,NUMBER and made his debut the next summer in the ORGANIZATION. It's been slow going since, especially with the bat, but he made progress in that regard in NUMBER in Double-A Reading and he kept it going with a move to Triple-A in NUMBER.PERSON has always had raw power, but it didn't really start showing up in games until last year when he hit NUMBER homers for Reading. He kept up his ability to impact the baseball with extra-base authority as he moved up a rung, showing that it was more than a result of his hitting-friendly environment in NUMBER. He's always been an aggressive hitter, albeit one who typically hasn't struck out a lot. His best defensive attribute is his cannon for an arm, though his lack of agility does limit his defensive value.With as long as a route as it's been for PERSON, he's still only NUMBER for all of the NUMBER season. He might have a ceiling as a backup, but he's not far from reaching it and could finally earn a spot on the NUMBER-man roster, either with a callup or being added after the NUMBER season is over.",0
"Prior to undergoing PERSON surgery in NUMBER, PERSON had reached Double-A PERSON, and he impressed scouts with his five-tool potential. After missing all of last year as he recovered, he picked up where he left off and played his way to the big leagues, debuting with the ORGANIZATION in August.Like PERSON, PERSON has good raw power, but he has a lot of swing-and-miss in his game. He's struck out more than NUMBER times in each of his professional seasons, and he'll need to refine his pitch recognition to make the most of his tools.PERSON has solid speed, and he uses it well on the basepaths and in the outfield. Before the surgery, he was mostly a right fielder, but he has played mostly left field since returning. PERSON's offensive skills allow him to profile in any outfield position.",1
"The ORGANIZATION always felt it was only a matter of time before PERSON started putting his skills to consistent use on the field. The initial thought was that it would be NUMBER, but struggles in his full-season debut combined with an injury derailed that. He came storming back in NUMBER with a move up to the ORGANIZATION State League, where he was among the league leaders in home runs and slugging percentage. However, he was unable to replicate that in his move to Double-A in NUMBER.PERSON shows some loud tools across the board and the plus makeup to maximize them. He has one of the strongest outfield arms in the Minors, a true cannon from right field that allowed him to collect NUMBER outfield assists in NUMBER. He has the speed to be a NUMBER-NUMBER stolen base guy in the future. His raw power is off the charts, and he's shown the ability to drive the ball to all fields. The one thing that has held him back as a hitter at times has been his pitch selection and plate discipline, something he focused on during instructs last fall.PERSON put up very good numbers even while being a bit of a free swinger in NUMBER, but that approach didn't work in the upper levels. If he can learn to stay in the zone more and work counts in his favor, he still has the chance to be a true five-tool player.",0
"PERSON was a huge standout player at the heavily-scouted ORGANIZATION showcase in the GPE in February. He didn't swing and miss in about a dozen swings (a rarity for the event) and made consistent loud contact while also displaying his above average speed and projectable power. PERSON is the ORGANIZATION got on him hard especially after this event and I was also at this event, so I buy the upside here, even if the swing is a little unique. PERSON has a chance to stick in center field, but at this age and body type, it's hard to predict the differnce between NUMBER and NUMBER and NUMBER speed at maturity, so you're buying more the well-rounded skillset than a particular position at this point.",0
"PERSON was known as a glove-first shortstop when the ORGANIZATION drafted him in NUMBER, and he remains an elite defender now. He has the arm, range and hands to be an above-average defender at shortstop. Playing on the same team as PERSON in NUMBER forced PERSON to split his time between shortstop and second base.  PERSON's bat isn't as advanced as his glove. He is still learning how to hit, and his swing has a tendency to get long. Without much power, he'll need to continue to improve his on-base skills.  Thanks to his defense, PERSON won't have to hit a ton to carve out a role in the ORGANIZATION. He still has time on his side, but will need to prove he can handle the more advanced pitching he'll face in the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON didn't get signed until he was NUMBER, two years after he became eligible, but has made up for lost time since turning pro for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. He has the best combination of stuff and pitchability among ORGANIZATION mound prospects and could advance quickly through the Minors. PERSON was pitching well in the Class A Advanced California League when he was part of the package sent to the Reds in return for PERSON Leake.PERSON overpowers hitters with a lively NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that reaches NUMBER. He can ride it by them up in the strike zone or impart it with heavy sink, a big reason he surrendered just one home run in his first two seasons in the GPE. He also can miss bats with his power curveball, which can get slurvy at times.His changeup gives PERSON a promising third pitch that dives at the plate when at its best. His crossfire delivery makes it tough to pick up his pitches but doesn't prevent him from filling the strike zone with ease. He missed nearly two months in NUMBER with a strained rotator cuff but returned in August with his usual stuff.",0
"The ORGANIZATION produced their second NUMBER-mph arm in as many years in NUMBER, as PERSON made the jump from Double-A to make his Major League debut in September, roughly NUMBER months after the arrival PERSON. He logged eight appearances out of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen down the stretch and then made strides in the ORGANIZATION before going to the ORGANIZATION with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON for PERSON in December. PERSON has had his velocity steadily increase over the last two seasons as he's added good strength to his tall and wiry frame. He'll frequently touch triple digits with his fastball and sits consistently in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with late movement. He features a pair of breaking balls in a fringy curveball and a hard, mid-NUMBERs slider that is an above-average, swing-and-miss pitch at its best. PERSON also will show flashes with an NUMBER-NUMBER mph changeup, a potentially average-or-better offering that plays up due to his fast arm but is lacking in overall consistency. PERSON does need to refine his command, but as he keeps adding velocity, he's still learning to harness his stuff. While pinpoint command won't be ever be necessary given his dynamic repertoire, he'll need to pitch down in the zone consistently to be an effective as a starter. At the least, PERSON has the weapons to become a dominant closer at the highest level.",1
"PERSON has long intrigued evaluators with a very impressive set of raw tools, even if he hasn't always been able to use them consistently. The ORGANIZATION liked them enough to get PERSON from the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON at the NUMBER PERSON, though a NUMBER-game suspension for a second positive ""drug of abuse"" test didn't help his reputation.PERSON is a big, strong athlete who looks like a premium power-speed guy when he's going well. He has a ton of raw power and extra-base ability, capable of driving the ball to all fields. With that pop comes a lot of swing and miss, leading to concerns about his hit tool. PERSON had largely played shortstop as a pro, but he got some time at third in the ORGANIZATION. While he didn't feel comfortable there at the outset, he played there and center field, where his athleticism plays well, upon his return from suspension. The ORGANIZATION hoped the suspension served as a wake-up call and helps PERSON mature. If it can all click, he has the raw tools to be a dynamic player who can impact the game in a number of ways.",1
"Originally a member of the NUMBER high school class, PERSON graduated a year early, making him eligible for the NUMBER Draft. Though the move had been in the works for several months, it was difficult for scouts to evaluate him because they hadn't concentrated on him during summer ball. The ORGANIZATION picked him in the third round anyway and he made a strong professional debut.  Known mostly for his power before the draft, PERSON showed a surprisingly mature hitting approach in his professional debut. Though he was a shortstop in high school, he has already moved to third base. He has a strong arm, but his lack of athleticism limits his range and some scouts think he will ultimately profile best at first base.  Wherever PERSON fits defensively, his bat will likely have to carry him.",0
"There are moments when GPE looks like one of the more dominant lefty relievers in baseball. He'll touch NUMBER, his fastball spins and has life, his slider is consistently plus, and he hides the ball well. At other times he's unplayably wild. The early parts of GPE's NUMBER spring were encouraging but, at age NUMBER, it's unlikely the issues that have plagued him for years have suddenly been remedied. He'll likely be a scintillating and terrifying low-leverage relief piece.",0
"PERSON was one of the top pitchers in the NUMBER international free agent class and the ORGANIZATION landed him about a month after his NUMBERth birthday. Even at the start of his professional career in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON has displayed an advanced feel for pitching and solid stuff. He pairs his fastball with a solid curveball. PERSON has a loose, easy delivery and as he physically matures, he should be able to more consistently throw in the mid-NUMBERs. He earns high marks for his intelligence and work ethic. While he has a long way to go to reach his ceiling, PERSON has the tools to eventually become a frontline Major League starter.",0
"PERSON has dealt with more adversity than most prospects, beginning with fracturing his elbow in an auto accident as a high school senior and dropping to the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft. He recovered to develop into one of the game's top lefty pitching prospects, only to blow out his elbow in NUMBER. He hasn't fully reclaimed the stuff he had prior to PERSON surgery, but he has reinvented himself and was thriving in his third try at Triple-A when he was dealt to GPE as part of a three-player package for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.Though PERSON still can hit NUMBER mph on occasion, he has lost a couple of ticks off his fastball and usually works from NUMBER-NUMBER. His changeup isn't the weapon it once was, so he has come up with a low-NUMBERs cutter to keep right-handers at bay. He also has a soft curveball that wasn't much of a factor before he got hurt.After battling his control and command in his first two Triple-A stints, PERSON has thrown more strikes and was doing a better job of keeping the ball down in the zone in NUMBER. He won't be the frontline starter he once projected to be, but he could help the Reds in the near future.",1
"Once a walk-on at ORGANIZATION, PERSON has become one of the more well-rounded catching prospects in the minors. He has always had near elite arm strength but because he didn't catch much pro-quality stuff in college, his receiving and ball-blocking were undercooked for a college prospect when he first entered pro ball. Those aspects of his defense have vastly improved, and he's now an average defender with a chance to be above, and his arm douses opposing baserunners. 
PERSON also has plus raw power, though he hasn't typically hit for it in games for various reasons. In college, a broken hamate likely masked his power and was part of the reason he fell to the NUMBER draft's third round. In pro ball, his swing has been very compact, relying on PERSON's raw strength rather than efficient biomechanical movement to deliver extra-bases. He broke his other hamate last year. PERSON's nearly .NUMBER SLG at ORGANIZATION is above what we expect moving forward, and instead think PERSON will be a high-contact bat with doubles power, which would be an above-average regular behind the plate.",0
"A ORGANIZATION State product who led all Division I pitchers in strikeouts during his junior season in NUMBER, PERSON continued to use his less-than-eye-popping stuff to find success, pitching across two levels of A ball in his first full season and finishing second in the system in ORGANIZATION, strikeouts and batting average against. He continued to befuddle hitters back in the ORGANIZATION State League in NUMBER.Upon first glance, hitters likely think PERSON is the kind of pitcher they will light up, largely because of a below-average fastball that doesn't even scrape NUMBER mph. What he does have is an outstanding curve that he will throw at any time. He can really spin it and will find continued success if he keeps commanding it well. Fear of that pitch and make his fastball seem ""sneaky fast"" and become more effective as a result. He does throw a changeup, though it's not as good as his other pitches. PERSON will have to prove that his stuff will continue to be effective as he moves up the ladder. He's been very effective against lefties, so at worst, he could profile as a specialist if starting doesn't work out.",0
"There wasn't a better story at the NUMBER ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON than PERSON. He originally signed with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER and stagnated for four years in low Class A before getting released in NUMBER. He served stints in three independent leagues before signing with the ORGANIZATION last October, and he has put up huge numbers in the upper levels of the Minors this season.If PERSON gets to the big leagues, it will be his huge power that takes him there. He probably won't post high batting averages and on-base percentages, but he has found more success since toning down what had been an all-or-nothing approach. While PERSON has a strong arm and broke into pro ball as a third baseman, he's strictly a first baseman. He's a well below-average athlete and runner who's a shaky defender.",0
"PERSON was anything but a known commodity when the ORGANIZATION acquired him from the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBER PERSON blockbuster that sent PERSON to GPE. He has since blossomed into one of the better shortstops prospects in the ORGANIZATION and advanced to Double-A at age NUMBER in NUMBER, when he was named a LOCATION All-Star and represented the World in the annual ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON. He earned All-Star honors for a third straight year in NUMBER, this time as a member of Triple-A Durham. PERSON generates hard line drives across the entire field thanks to a combination of plus bat speed and barrel control, and he consistently puts himself in a good position to hit thanks to his advanced feel for the strike zone and knack for working deep counts. His power has come along as he's climbed the ladder, highlighted by career highs in home runs (NUMBER) and doubles (NUMBER) last season in the LOCATION, and scouts expect he'll offer at least average power at maturity. PERSON compensates for his average speed with excellent instincts and quick feet at shortstop, where he profiles as an above-average defender with soft hands, smooth footwork and plus arm strength. To go along with loud tools and both sides of the ball, PERSON continues to receive raves from club officials for his plus makeup and leadership skills. He has all the ingredients to develop into an All-Star-caliber shortstop capable of hitting in the middle of a lineup and could soon be ready for his first taste of the Majors.",1
"A NUMBERth-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of a GPE high school in NUMBER, PERSON took over at shortstop for Rice in the second game of his freshman season. He hit safely in his first NUMBER starts and has performed steadily ever since for the ORGANIZATION and during two summers in the ORGANIZATION. He's not loaded with sexy tools but he's a grinder who gets the most out of what he has.PERSON uses a compact left-handed stroke to drill line drives to all fields. He controls the strike zone well and projects to post solid batting averages and on-base percentages. While he won't be a slugger, he does have a bit of raw power and is doing a better job of driving the ball in NUMBER.PERSON's fringy speed and quickness limits his effectiveness on the bases and range at shortstop. He has the hands and actions for the position, but he possesses just an average arm and can't always make plays to his right. Though he'll get the chance to stick at shortstop in pro ball, he's likely destined for second base.",0
"With PERSON's basketball odyssey perhaps over, PERSON is excited to see what this big left-hander can do with his focus solely on baseball.The PERSON signed PERSON knowing he would split time between college hoops and the Minors. After two years at ORGANIZATION's and then a transfer to PERSON State-Northridge, it appears PERSON might be turning his sights to the mound full-time. He has always had a big arm, firing fastballs up to NUMBER mph without much baseball experience. PERSON's secondary stuff is understandably inconsistent, but both his breaking ball and changeup show signs of being solid weapons. His athleticism should help him with his delivery and to improve his command and control.PERSON was excited by PERSON's potential when the club gave him $NUMBER million to sign in NUMBER. It looks like the PERSON are about to get a true look at what he can become.",0
"PERSON was a top high school talent out of GPE in NUMBER when the ORGANIZATION went well over pick value to sign him in the fifth round of that June's Draft. He was making slow, incremental progress, slowed periodically by injuries, when he was dealt to the Cardinals in July NUMBER for international bonus pool money. He responded by having a breakout year, playing across two levels of the upper Minors and earning a spot on GPE' NUMBER-man roster.PERSON has long had solid all-around tools with plus instincts that allow them to play up. More than anything, staying healthy was the key component in his leap forward in NUMBER as he had a full season really for the first time in his career. He has a simple approach at the plate and was able to tap into the raw power he'd shown since high school by standing a little more upright at the plate and making his feet a little more narrow in his setup, leading to him more than doubling his career home run output heading into the season. PERSON has very good speed and excellent instincts on the basepaths, though he has to learn to be more efficient when stealing bases. His speed and instincts help him in the outfield, where he's above-average in center field and has more than enough arm to handle a corner spot if needed.If things keep moving in the right direction, PERSON has the upside to be a NUMBER homer-NUMBER stolen base kind of offensive performer. He might be best suited as a valuable fourth outfielder, but seeing him play his way into an every day role in center field isn't out of the question.",1
"PERSON has struggled with injuries throughout his career and missed all of NUMBER after undergoing PERSON surgery. He looked as good as ever when he got back on the mound in NUMBER, but was once again beset by injuries in NUMBER. PERSON isn't throwing quite as hard as he did before his surgery when his fastball peaked at NUMBER mph, instead settling comfortably in the low-NUMBERs. His changeup is slightly better than his curveball, but both are at least PERSON average offerings. He commands all of his pitches well and earns praise for his confident demeanor on the mound. If he can just stay healthy, PERSON has all the tools to get to GPE as a starter. A move to the bullpen is not out of the question, however.",0
"PERSON loved ORGANIZATION' athleticism and arm strength when he was coming out of high school in GPE in NUMBER, but his size contributed to him lasting until the ORGANIZATION took him in the NUMBERth round. He drew some interest from college football programs as a quarterback before deciding to focus on pitching at ORGANIZATION. Three years later, ORGANIZATION signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a third-rounder.ORGANIZATION has a quick arm that produces NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastballs that top out at NUMBER mph. He can throw the ball by hitters up in the strike zone, or he can induce groundouts in the lower part of the zone. ORGANIZATION' hard slider shows some promise, while his changeup is a work in progress.While ORGANIZATION' size leads to questions about his durability, he helps his cause by filling the strike zone and keeping his pitch counts down. ORGANIZATION maintains his velocity into the late innings, so he could become a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter if he can refine his secondary pitches.",0
"PERSON was part of one of the best high school pitching staffs of all time with #NUMBER on this list ORGANIZATION and FACILITY RHP PERSON. PERSON went NUMBERth overall in NUMBER and had PERSON surgery within a year, then was traded to GPE as the headliner in the ORGANIZATION deal. PERSON has flashed signs of brilliance since his return but a gnarly blister limited most of his NUMBER and some scouts still question his command, wondering if he fits better in short stints. No one questions his knockout curveball, which gets grades as high as a NUMBER from scouts on the NUMBER-NUMBER scale. His fastball sits NUMBER-NUMBER and hits NUMBER mph while his changeup is above average and he has a good chance to open NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION rotation alongside #NUMBER on this list ORGANIZATION.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON with the NUMBERth overall pick of the NUMBER Draft, they hoped he would profile well at a corner spot. The corner has changed, but the hope for PERSON remains the same.PERSON made the move from third base to the outfield full time in NUMBER and actually took to it better than expected. He has below-average range because of a lack of speed, but he's adequate in either corner instead of being the liability some predicted. In NUMBER, he played more right because of PERSON's presence in left field on the championship-winning Chattanooga club. At the plate, PERSON has been streaky, showing stretches of figuring things out and struggling with the bat. He has made strides in his overall approach, drawing more walks and cutting down his strikeouts. It's unclear if PERSON will develop the power desired to be a regular at one of those outfield corners, but the ORGANIZATION think he's a better hitter than what he's shown. Just NUMBER for all of NUMBER, there's time for him to reach his offensive ceiling.",0
"The earliest-drafted pitcher ever from GPE, PERSON had a huge NUMBER season that saw him start the PERSON in GPE, pitch well in Double-A and even made a start in Triple-A, all at age NUMBER. He followed that up with another strong season in NUMBER, including a second straight PERSON start. PERSON pitches with the kind of confidence you like to see in a young starter. He has a live, quick arm that fires fastballs that touch NUMBER-NUMBER mph regularly and easily sits in the low-NUMBERs. His changeup is his best secondary offering, a sinking offspeed pitch which is very effective against left-handed hitters. His breaking ball is a hard slurve, thrown with good deception, and he'll vary the velocity and size of it to throw hitters off. PERSON is very athletic, repeating his delivery well and staying in and around the strike zone consistently. There isn't much more for PERSON to prove at the ORGANIZATION level. Because he just turned NUMBER during the NUMBER season, there isn't any reason to rush him.",1
"After a promising freshman year at GPE A&M in NUMBER, PERSON transferred to PERSON (GPE) CC and became Draft-eligible in NUMBER. He ranked second among national junior college pitchers in strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) and went to the ORGANIZATION in the third round for a below-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER. He has continued to miss bats in pro ball and earned a promotion to high Class A two months into his first full pro season.PERSON's primary pitches are a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball with riding life and a curveball that can be a plus pitch at times. His breaking stuff regressed when he was at FACILITY, but he has regained depth on his curve and sharpened his hard slider since turning pro. He also has an effective changeup, giving him four average-or-better offerings.PERSON has a deep repertoire and has improved his strike-throwing ability as a pro. But scouts aren't completely sold on him as a starter because there's effort and a lot going on in his delivery. If he can't make it in the rotation, he could be valuable as multi-inning reliever.",0
"PERSON has spent the bulk of each of the last two seasons at Triple-A, a victim of the ORGANIZATION terrific outfield depth. So excellent is his natural feel to hit that it's amazing many scouts preferred him on the mound while PERSON was in high school. He's a career NUMBER% strikeout hitter, whose rates haven't really moved even as the ORGANIZATION have altered his swing to make it more explosive and try to get PERSON to hit for more power. His stance is super wide open, the way PERSON's is, before PERSON takes a long, slow stride toward the pitcher, leading with his heel, and then uncorks a max-effort hack that sometimes sends him reeling into the ground. 
It's incredible that PERSON is athletic enough to make so much contact with this swing, but he still doesn't lift the ball very much, and probably maxes out with doubles power. We don't think he fits in center field, and the lack of power is largely why he's down here, though it also sounds like part of the reason teams have been asking for other ORGANIZATION prospects in trades is due to some past off-field stuff.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON made an immediate impression with his advanced pitchability. He led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with a NUMBER/NUMBER K/BB ratio in his NUMBER pro debut, then ranked fifth in the LOCATION League with a NUMBER/NUMBER mark the following season, when he was the low Class A circuit's youngest pitching qualifier at age NUMBER. The jump to high Class A didn't go as smoothly in NUMBER, though he fared better there this year before elbow inflammation ended his season in early June.PERSON lacks a plus pitch and wasn't able to baffle high Class A hitters with his command and deception. His best offering is his fading changeup, which helped him hold left-handers to a .NUMBER ORGANIZATION last year. But righties teed off on him to the tune of a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION, as his NUMBER-NUMBER mph four-seam fastball, his fringy curveball and new slider weren't able to keep them at bay. PERSON has to be precise with the location of his pitches in order to succeed, and he wasn't as sharp in NUMBER. His command helps his fastball play above its mediocre velocity but that wasn't enough to keep it off barrels last year. He has a unique windup with a deep knee bend and a twist, though that hasn't thrown hitters off as much in high Class A as it had at lower levels.",0
"PERSON didn't enter the spring with much fanfare and his teammate PERSON was considered to be PERSON's best Draft-eligible pitcher. That quickly changed as PERSON's fastball was regularly clocked up to NUMBER mph. PERSON's track record isn't as long as a typical top college pitcher, such as PERSON, but his exciting stuff eventually put him in the conversation for the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick anyway. PERSON has excellent size for a right-hander and uses it to generate easy velocity. He throws his fastball in the mid- to upper-NUMBERs. PERSON's slider is his best offspeed pitch and he also throws a solid changeup. He improved his command this year and pitches well off his fastball. PERSON has the stuff to become a top of the rotation starter.",0
"A GPE defector, PERSON created a stir before the NUMBER Draft when the Majors briefly made him eligible, and the ORGANIZATION considered taking him with their first-round pick. ORGANIZATION pulled him out of that Draft but put him back in 'NUMBER, when GPE made him a third-rounder. He had bone chips removed from his elbow in November NUMBER and missed most of the NUMBER season, after which the FACILITY claimed him on waivers.Used mostly as a reliever in pro ball, PERSON relies mostly on two pitches: a fastball, which usually arrives at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and seems quicker because he employs a deliberate delivery, and a curveball. He has a hard curve that gets up to NUMBER mph and elicits swings and misses, and he has a slower mid-NUMBERs version that he can get over the plate for strikes.PERSON also has a raw changeup, but the lack of an effective third offering and spotty control make him a better option in the bullpen rather than the rotation. Provided that he's healthy, he could contribute to GPE's bullpen in NUMBER.",1
"Regarded by evaluators as one of the better prep hitters in the NUMBER Draft class, PERSON signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million at the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. While he lived up to his reputation during his pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON and PERSON, PERSON was beset by a hamstring injury in NUMBER that required two trips to the disabled list and limited him to just NUMBER games at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin. He's managed to stay healthy at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Carolina in NUMBER, and it's allowed PERSON to turn in his most complete season to date.PERSON gripped the bat with a golf-style grip upon entering pro ball, but he's since adopted a more conventional grip without having to alter his left-handed swing. He's explosive to the ball and keeps his barrel in the hitting zone for an extended period of time to produce hard contact to all fields. Combine that with his physical strength, and PERSON should develop at least average power. And even though the hamstring injury diminished his speed last season, PERSON is an above-average runner who can impact the game on the basepaths as well as in center field, where he profiles as an above-average defender.PERSON offensive ceiling is amplified by his potential to remain in center field, where he's spent much of his pro career. Should he be forced off the position, there's little doubt he would hit enough to hold down an outfield corner, though his fringy arm strength might limit him to left field.",1
"In his two seasons since signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a GPE defector, PERSON has proven to be one of the best and most disciplined hitters in the GPE system. He doesn't try to do too much and rarely chases pitches out of the strike zone, resulting in one line drive after another.Though PERSON' simple approach has produced little power so far, he's strong and the GPE are confident some extra-base hits will come. There are questions about how much bat speed he has and how much pop it can generate.PERSON has played well at third base and though he has yet to try another position, GPE believes he's versatile enough to handle a utility role if needed. He has average speed and arm strength.",0
"A bit of an enigma in college, PERSON dominated in the ORGANIZATION and PERSON college leagues during the summers but bounced between roles while battling his control during the springs at FACILITY A&M. He opened NUMBER in the GPE bullpen before moving to the rotation in late March, pitching well until he tired in June. Drafted in the second round with a pick the ORGANIZATION received from the ORGANIZATION as punishment for the hacking scandal, he signed for a below-slot $NUMBER million.PERSON worked with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball and peaked at NUMBER as a Cape reliever, and he dialed it down to NUMBER-NUMBER to throw more strikes as a starter during the spring. His curveball can be just as overpowering, featuring both power and depth, and he also can miss bats with his mid-NUMBERs slider. He also exhibits some feel for a changeup that could develop into another solid offering as he uses it more often.There's no question that PERSON has enough pitches to make it as a starter. Recruited as a two-way player out of high school, he has athleticism that should help his control and durability. If he can't command his pitches well enough to stick in the rotation, he has late-inning upside as a reliever.",0
"When a guy hits NUMBER homers and throws NUMBER touchdown passes in the same college year, you know heâs a special athlete. Heâs had two solid seasons in the ORGANIZATION organization, showing progress from one year to the next. More than anything, PERSON became a much more selective hitter in NUMBER, cutting down on his strikeouts and drawing a lot more walks. That has helped him work better counts and give him more of an opportunity to tap into his outstanding raw power. He has bat speed and obvious athleticism, though heâs a below-average runner. His arm is strong enough for right field and his bat should profile well there, too, though his speed may make him a better left fielder. The only thing that held him back at all in NUMBER were some injuries to his wrist and thumb, the latter of which kept him from playing in the ORGANIZATION. Heâs ready to hit the upper levels of the ORGANIZATIONâ system.",0
"An athletic, toolsy outfielder, PERSON impressed in his first full professional season, reaching Double-A Harrisburg and finishing the year in the ORGANIZATION. He returned to both leagues in NUMBER and had slightly better results.  PERSON knows how to get on base and, when he's right, uses the whole field to hit. He has worked to simplify his swing, but still has room for improvement, especially against left-handers. PERSON has some good pop, but his best tool is his plus speed. He uses it on the basepaths well and has the look of a future leadoff hitter. Defensively, he is solid in center field and has a good arm.  If PERSON can harness all his athleticism, he has the ability to become the ORGANIZATION center fielder of the future.",0
"There's a lot of disagreement in baseball about whether or not PERSON's fastball is going to play in the big leagues. It's certainly not slow, and routinely creeps into the mid-NUMBERs. And the combination of PERSON's size and drop-and-drive delivery creates flat plane that plays well with good curveballs, which he has. But the fastball doesn't spin and doesn't sneak over the top of hitter's barrels, so there's some fear he'll be homer-prone. PERSON is also an incredible athlete with a video game breaking ball and improving changeup, so we like his chances to turn into something, just probably a no. NUMBER/NUMBER starter. He siged for $NUMBER.NUMBER million late in NUMBER and spent all of NUMBER at ORGANIZATION.",0
"Originally a NUMBERth-round pick by the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON opted not to sign and instead honored his commitment to GPE, where he pitched for one season before transferring to PERSON and sitting out for all of 'NUMBER. Selected by the Nationals in the NUMBERnd round the following year, PERSON has rewarded the organization by making steady progress in each pro season and reached Double-A for the first time in June NUMBER. A two-sport standout who excelled on both the hardwood and diamond as a prep, PERSON stands out on the mound for his blend of athleticism, stuff and remaining projection. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER right-hander pitches with a low-NUMBERs fastball that features exceptional sink and nets him a plethora of weak, ground-ball outs. PERSON pairs his heater with a quality changeup, giving him two above-average offerings, and the Nationals have been pleased with his development of a slider. PERSON possesses average control and command because he repeats his delivery and arm action well. That feel for pounding the zone allows for PERSON's three-pitch mix to play up, and he's long proved adept at keeping the ball in the park. While he remains a work-in-progress overall, PERSON's impressive development and remaining projection has led some evaluators to peg him as a future back-end starter at the highest level.",0
"Drafted out of ORGANIZATION as a red-shirt junior who had PERSON surgery, PERSON has shown a combination of intriguing stuff and subpar command in his brief pro career. That, plus his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound frame, have some believing he's a reliever long-term, though the Rays continue to allow him to develop as a starter.PERSON has a power arsenal that misses bats consistently. His fastball touches the mid-NUMBERs and features considerable arm-side run, and he combines it with a power breaking ball and a potentially average changeup. As good as his swing-and-miss stuff is, he struggles finding the strike zone, walking NUMBER.NUMBER batters per nine innings heading into NUMBER.While he does maintain his velocity into starts and doesn't have a ton of effort in his delivery, most feel PERSON will end up in the bullpen, where he could see an uptick in velocity and serve as an effective short reliever.",0
"A NUMBERth-round Draft pick in NUMBER out of ORGANIZATION, PERSON wasn't considered much of a prospect during his first three pro seasons. He changed that perception in NUMBER with a breakout performance at age NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION State League, and then he held his own the following year over a full season in the Double-A PERSON before a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION League.Though he stands a diminutive NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, PERSON has excellent strength for his size and creates above-average bat speed from the right side. The result is sneaky power to all fields, though he does most of his damage to the pull side. That he finished third in walks in both the ORGANIZATION and EL in back-to-back years highlights his ability to control the strike zone and work deep counts, although his patient approach does lead to some swing-and-miss. PERSON' on-base skills also help him contribute on the basepaths, where his plus speed makes him a threat to steal NUMBER-plus bases annually.PERSON spent much of his time between the outfield corners before shifting to center field in NUMBER. Though he took quickly to the position and made overall strides as a defender in the process, he's likely to be a better long-term fit in left field on account of his below-average arm. ORGANIZATION hasn't produced a big leaguer since NUMBER, but PERSON could very well end that drought if he continues down his current path.",0
"The Friday night starter for the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a sophomore and junior, PERSON helped lead the Cavaliers to their first ORGANIZATION title in his first year in that role, then followed it up with a strong junior campaign. Seen as a rather safe college performer who was more high floor than high ceiling, he lasted until the end of the second round, where the ORGANIZATION gave him an above-pick value bonus of $NUMBER.NUMBER million.PERSON features a heavy fastball up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph, sitting more in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. It's more about the plus sink than the velocity and the right-hander gets a ton of groundball outs. He'll throw two breaking balls -- a curve he uses to get strike one and a better slider with good, late bite that often serves as his out pitch. He can mix in a solid changeup with good movement.Starting pitchers from GPE haven't fared well in the pro game, but PERSON seems a good bet to reach his ceiling, even if it's not as high as some others. After a heavy workload this spring, he'll be used sparingly this summer, really getting his pro career started in earnest in NUMBER.",0
"PERSON went from walk-on to supplemental first-round pick in three years at FACILITY, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER as the NUMBERth overall choice in NUMBER. A career .NUMBER hitter in college, he jumped to low Class A to begin his pro career and batted .NUMBER with NUMBER steals in NUMBER games. He posted similar numbers in high Class A to start NUMBER but struggled in Double-A during the second half.PERSON's pure hitting ability and on-base skills could make him a top-of-the-order hitter. A plus runner with good instincts, he uses his speed to beat out hits and steal bases. He has yet to demonstrate any impactful power, going homerless last year and slugging .NUMBER in his first two pro seasons, and he will need to show he can elevate and drive the ball at least occasionally in order to become a big league regular.Though he's quick, PERSON is going to have to polish his reads and route in order to stay in center field. His fringy arm makes left field the alternative and he doesn't have the power to profile at that position. He has one of the higher floors among PERSON position prospects but his ceiling may be limited.",0
"After a bonus-skimming scandal rocked the FACILITY' international scouting department in NUMBER, it didn't make a significant signing for five years. That drought ended when PERSON signed PERSON, ORGANIZATION's No. NUMBER-rated prospect in the NUMBER-NUMBER international signing period, for $NUMBER.NUMBER million out of the ORGANIZATION. PERSON and hamate maladies limited him to a total of NUMBER games in his first two full pro seasons, but he finally started to hit as hoped when he stayed healthy in NUMBER.PERSON combines bat speed and strength with loft and leverage in his right-handed swing, giving him as much raw power as any FACILITY prospect. He hit just .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with a NUMBER percent strikeout rate in his first three years a pro, when his stroke often got too long and too steep. Getting regular at-bats has helped him make adjustments this year, as he has started to recognize pitches better and become less pull-happy.PERSON's arm strength is just as jaw-dropping as his power, and those two tools make him an easy fit for the right-field profile. He's already starting to mature and could lose a step off his presently average speed once that process is complete. That shouldn't stop him from becoming an average defender, however.",0
"Scouting grades: Fastball: NUMBER | Curveball: NUMBER | Control: NUMBER | Overall: NUMBERPERSON had an up-and-down career as a two-way player at GPE, serving at times as a lefty swingman and showing glimpses of offensive ability as a hitter. Taken with no expectations as a NUMBERth-round senior sign, PERSON focused on his bat for much of his pro career. Playing mostly first base and a little outfield, he'd always hit well, then broke out across three levels and led the organization in ORGANIZATION and finished tied for the lead in home runs. At the same time, he started re-introducing pitching to his resume, showing some aptitude as a lefty reliever and making it to the big leagues in May as a two-way player.PERSON's raw power from the left side has always been intriguing and he started tapping into it consistently in NUMBER. There were plenty of strikeouts, but also a much higher walk rate, and that improved approach helped him get more pitches to drive. Defensively, he probably is a first baseman only, but it's the bat that gives him a chance to hit in the big leagues.It's hard to evaluate what kind of pitcher PERSON is. Without any real instruction or program, he was touching NUMBER mph with his fastball and could spin an occasional plus breaking ball. After PERSON's offseason with a dedicated throwing program, the ORGANIZATION are anxious to see if he can be a two-way player at the highest level.",0
"The ORGANIZATION knew that PERSON -- a high school product who didn't catch much in high school because of his athleticism -- would take time to develop. An injury-interrupted first full season didn't help in that regard, either. The ORGANIZATION made the decision in NUMBER to move him to third base, at least for the short term.Pittsburgh's aggressive promotion of PERSON to full-season ball in NUMBER proved to be challenging for the GPE prepster, particularly defensively. Shoulder problems hurt his development, but PERSON made strides offensively at instructional league, and the ORGANIZATION believe in his bat and work ethic.PERSON should get a mulligan for NUMBER, and the move to third will allow him to let his bat develop more, not to mention free up a playing-time logjam with ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON first made a name for himself on the mound by striking out NUMBER batters in a game at the NUMBER Little League World Series. He projected as a possible first-rounder as both a prepster and collegian, but surgery to correct thoracic outlet syndrome before his senior high school season dropped him to the NUMBERrd round (ORGANIZATION) in NUMBER and control woes undermined him at ORGANIZATION. A seventh-rounder in NUMBER, he thrived at two Class A levels in his first full pro season but regressed terribly in Double-A last year.When PERSON repeats his delivery and maintains his low-three-quarters arm slot, his fastball and curveball can grade as well above-average offerings. At his best, he can reach NUMBER mph with riding life on his fastball and snap off nasty low-NUMBERs breaking balls with power and depth. He didn't keep his mechanics together nearly as well in NUMBER as he did the year before, resulting in a low-NUMBERs heater and a more benign curve.PERSON' fading changeup also was less effective last season, when he also suffered from the control issues that plagued him as an amateur. The ORGANIZATION were encouraged by the progress he made in six ORGANIZATION starts and plan on keeping him in the rotation. Simplifying things by moving him to the bullpen could give him crisper stuff in shorter stints, though he'll still have to throw more strikes.",0
"One of the best all-around athletes in the NUMBER Draft class, PERSON was viewed as a potential early-first-round pick heading into the spring before an inconsistent junior campaign for the ORGANIZATION caused his stock fall late. Pleased to find him still on the board in the second round, the ORGANIZATION selected him with the NUMBERth overall pick and signed him for slightly over $NUMBER million. After struggling in his first full season, PERSON went to the GPE ORGANIZATION and rediscovered his swing. It led to a breakout NUMBER campaign in which he earned his first Double-A promotion in July after playing in the prestigious ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON at ORGANIZATION. A switch-hitter, PERSON is once again showing the ability to hit for both average and power after making an adjustment to his setup and swing path that has made him shorter to the ball with more extension after contact. He has plus-plus speed that translates on both sides of the ball, making him a threat to steal on the basepaths as well as an above-average defender capable of sticking in center field.PERSON has a tall, athletic build that gives him the potential to do a lot of things well on the baseball field, but he still has his share of gains to make as a hitter. A refined approach and better swing mechanics certainly have him back on track, though time will tell how his game, particularly his hitting, translates at higher levels.",0
"PERSON jumped firmly onto the GPE radar with an outstanding performance in the NUMBER Cape Cod League that led to an All-Star selection and playoff ORGANIZATION honors. He didn't fare as well as a GPE junior but still earned a third-round selection by ORGANIZATION in June and then had a promising debut. He spent the offseason reworking his swing and approach, and it paid immediate dividends in his first full season as he paced the Class A ORGANIZATION in most offensive categories before moving up to high Class A Dunedin in late May. Although his production slowed a bit in the pitcher-friendly PERSON, PERSON still put together a monster season, finishing with a .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER line, NUMBER home runs, NUMBER doubles and NUMBER steals in NUMBER games. PERSON's offseason adjustments were centered on him eliminating a hole in his swing, and he showed a shorter, more leveraged path to the ball in NUMBER, with improved feel for keeping his barrel in the zone and driving the ball to all fields. PERSON's plus raw power from the right side of the plate is for real, and he hits some of his most impressive home runs to the opposite field. PERSON does have some swing-and-miss to his game, but it's a fair trade off given his ability to hit for both average and power. PERSON's speed is only average, but he gets the most out of it on the basepaths, wisely picking his spots to steal and consistently getting good jumps.PERSON's offensive profile is only enhanced by his abilities at shortstop, where he's an above-average defender with soft hands, good range and plus arm strength. His defensive profile also fits well at third base, and PERSON appeared in NUMBER games at the hot corner in NUMBER on top of his usual reps up the middle. The ORGANIZATION rave about PERSON's baseball IQ and work ethic, believing those qualities will allow him to always get the most out of his tools and surpass expectations.",0
"PERSON entered his Draft season back in NUMBER as one of the more intriguing high school shortstops in his class. He struggled at the plate that spring, something that continued into his pro career after the ORGANIZATION took him in the second round. That carried over to his defense, where he wasn't as strong as hoped. But when the organization moved him to the outfield in NUMBER, something clicked, and his bat started taking off in NUMBER.The NUMBER-year-old's maturity, both physically and mentally, has been key. Added strength has led to vastly improved bat speed, allowing him to make more consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate, even showing some extra-base pop. He's always been a good basestealer and that's continued as he's moved up to the upper levels of the system. Moving off of shortstop has allowed PERSON to relax more on both sides of the ball as well. He's already a solid defender in center, with a chance to be plus out there when all is said and done.PERSON was on the verge of being a forgotten prospect, no better than an organizational filler. But he's resurrected his career and if he can keep doing what he's done in NUMBER, he has the chance to impact a big league outfield in the near future.",0
"One of many ORGANIZATION products in the ORGANIZATION' system, ORGANIZATION made it to the big leagues, albeit briefly, as a starter in NUMBER, his second full season of pro ball. He made it back to GPE in NUMBER, this time as a reliever, pitching very well in the season's final month and change to put him in line for a bullpen job.The move to the 'pen was necessary in part because of a back issue that derailed his NUMBER season and kept him off the mound in NUMBER until June. A brief callup in July didn't go well, but ORGANIZATION learned from that experience, understanding that better overall command was necessary for success at that level. He lives primarily off of his power sinking fastball that can touch the mid-NUMBERs in shorter stints and generates a ton of ground-ball outs. He has a good feel for spinning his breaking ball, but it's inconsistent. He still has a fosh-like changeup that flashes average at times.His back issues hopefully behind him, ORGANIZATION appears poised for a life in the bullpen, most likely as a middle reliever and a ceiling of perhaps a seventh-inning type.",1
"The FACILITY usually avoid going way over the assigned bonus values to sign PERSON picks, but they have no regrets about paying PERSON $NUMBER,NUMBER as a seventh-rounder in NUMBER. He has performed consistently despite being one of the youngest regulars in his league in each of his first two years in full-season ball, showing the potential to become an all-around player at third base.A switch-hitter with a nice stroke from both sides of the plate, PERSON showed better pitch recognition in NUMBER. He also hinted at his power upside by ranking second in the Class A Advanced PERSON with NUMBER doubles and tied for third with NUMBER extra-base hits. His bat speed, strength and willingness to use the entire field bode well for his ability to hit for average and power.PERSON has below-average speed but is athletic for his size and caught a NUMBER-yard touchdown pass as a tight end to help PERSON win the GPE state NUMBER-A football championship game in NUMBER. A shortstop at ORGANIZATION, he has improved his reactions and his range to both sides as he has gotten more comfortable at the hot corner. He has solid hands and arm strength but needs to improve his footwork and throwing accuracy after topping PERSON third basemen with NUMBER errors.",0
"PERSON has plenty in the way of pure tools: he's a plus runner with a plus-plus arm who's average defensively at shortstop. He can play all over and has some raw power and lift to his swing, which the ORGANIZATION added over the past few seasons. There isn't a ton of feel to hit and scouts who were betting that getting away from GPE, combined with his athleticism, would unlock more offensive potential are running out of time to be proven right, but PERSON is still a useful NUMBERth man type of ballplayer.",0
"Even after the FACILITY trade, the ORGANIZATION have more promising young infielders than they have spots to play them. Adding to the logjam is PERSON, who has been one of the most intriguing hitters in the system since signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. After facing adversity for the first time in NUMBER, he rebounded to perform well in Double-A and the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBER-year-old last season.A switch-hitter, PERSON has a fluid swing and makes consistent contact from both sides of the plate. He understands the strike zone and could develop into a solid hitter for both average and power. PERSON fits the offensive profile of an everyday third baseman in the big leagues, though he's not going to push PERSON off the hot corner in Chicago.Though PERSON has below-average speed and quickness, he has worked hard on his defense and is selling more scouts on his ability to stay at third base. His hands and arm are assets, and his instincts help him make plays.",1
"There's little doubt about PERSON's ability to swing the bat. He batted .NUMBER as a junior at GPE (Va.) High, and then followed the performance by posting a .NUMBER mark last spring. His size and lack of profile, however, made him a bit of a polarizing prospect among scouts, although that didn't keep the Mariners from drafting him in the second round. After signing for an above-slot bonus of $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER, PERSON showcased his promising bat with a strong start to his career in the Rookie-level PERSON League.The left-handed hitting third baseman can flat-out rake as possibly the best pure hitter in his area. He barrels balls up consistently and has some power to go along with it. Everything else, though, is a bit of a question mark. Scouts have seen PERSON play an adequate third base, but there is far from consensus that he can stay there, meaning he'd have to move to first or perhaps to left field, though the jury is still out over whether he's athletic enough for such a move. He's under six feet tall and doesn't have much projection to him, so he kind of is what he is at this point.Beyond his physical tools, the Mariners rave about PERSON's makeup and baseball IQ, both of which should help him to make a smooth adjustment to pro ball.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION traded PERSON and PERSON to the D-backs, they did so to acquire more international bonus slot money. That money allowed them to go out and spend $NUMBER million to sign PERSON, who was ranked No. NUMBER on MLBPipeline.com's ORGANIZATION list leading up to the July NUMBER signing period.The ORGANIZATION were investing in PERSON's bat, and watch the big teenager swing the bat once and it's easy to see why. No one in this past international class had the raw power PERSON has, the kind of pop scouts haven't seen from the amateur scene in a long time. And it's not just raw power; PERSON has shown the ability to use it in game action. While there are things he needs to work on in terms of his approach, the ORGANIZATION were impressed with the feel to hit he exhibited during his time in instructs. They also saw someone more athletic than they anticipated, with a solid throwing arm. They might be in the minority, but they think he has the chance to stick in an outfield corner.Whether that's the case or whether he has to move to first like most anticipate, if his bat progresses as anticipated, he'll profile from just about anywhere.",0
"Initially recruited by the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a third baseman, PERSON blossomed on the mound and some clubs thought PERSON was the best pitcher available in the NUMBER Draft. The ORGANIZATION were delighted to grab him with the fifth overall selection and a $NUMBER million bonus. They hoped he could contribute to their big league club by NUMBER at the latest, but elbow, biceps, lat and shoulder woes limited him to NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in his first three pro seasons, including just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER last year. When healthy, PERSON fits the ace profile. He usually works at NUMBER-NUMBER with his fastball, which has reached triple digits, and his hammer curveball can be equally as devastating. Both his slider and changeup show the makings of becoming solid options as well.PERSON is also an outstanding athlete who repeats his delivery well, so he has no trouble throwing quality strikes. The ORGANIZATION hoped offseason arthroscopic surgery to clean up his shoulder would return him to full health, but he had a setback and didn't appear in a game until late May. PERSON opted to ease him back into action as a reliever but still envisions him as a starter in the long run.",0
"All Boyd did during his career at ORGANIZATION State was hit and that's continued as he embarked on his first full season of pro ball, quickly earning a promotion up a level. The right-handed hitting first baseman should hit for plenty of average as he moves up the ladder, but it remains to be seen just how much power there is in his bat. A former third baseman, he plays a very solid defensive first base, though it's his bat that will have to carry him up the organizational ladder. How much power he ends up displaying will help determine if he can be an everyday player at first.",0
"After they weren't able to land PERSON, the ORGANIZATION took much of the money they had saved for a run at the GPE two-way star, swung a couple of minor trades for additional international bonus pool funds and signed PERSON in March for $NUMBER.NUMBER million. He batted .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER steals in NUMBER games in GPE's top league as a NUMBER-year-old in NUMBER-NUMBER before defecting. Before joining GPE, he spent parts of two seasons in the independent Can-Am League and hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER steals in NUMBER contests.Though his most eye-catching tool is his well above-average speed, PERSON has the potential to contribute in all phases of the game. He makes consistent contact and shows decent patience from the left side of the plate, so he should hit for a solid average. He's not a big guy and is at his best when he doesn't hunt home runs, but he can generate some surprising pop with bat speed and strength in his hands and wrists. PERSON's quickness makes him a basestealing threat and gives him plenty of range in center field. He has fringy arm strength that's playable in center but would limit his usefulness in right. He doesn't have quite the offensive upside of the ORGANIZATION' best prospect, PERSON, but he's faster and his tools aren't too dissimilar.",0
"PERSON has the size and pure stuff to succeed, but has yet to really get his pro career going. The NUMBER season was his first that saw him throw more than NUMBER innings in one season, as elbow soreness derailed his NUMBER return to GPE and the ORGANIZATION. Now healthy, PERSON features an above-average fastball, with some good sink that allows him to record a lot of groundball outs. He throws both a curve and a slider, and both show glimpses of being PERSON average offerings, though they can sometimes blend into each other in terms of form and shape. His changeup lags well behind the other secondary offerings, but it improved enough to help him be more effective against left-handed hitters than he had been in the past. PERSON has the stuff to fulfill his potential as a back-end starter and he took a step in the right direction by staying on the mound in NUMBER.",0
"The ORGANIZATION ace entered his junior season billed as the most advanced college pitcher in the class and he didn't disappoint, finishing among the ORGANIZATION Division I leaders in a host of pitching categories. That led to the Phillies taking him with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick in the GPE. He signed quickly and made his professional debut all the way up in the ORGANIZATION State League.ORGANIZATIONt the biggest right-hander in the world, PERSON has tremendous command of his three-pitch mix. His fastball sits in the low NUMBERs and appears even faster thanks to his low three-quarters arm slot. He locates to both sides and throws his fastball with plenty of sink. His changeup is plus at times and he throws his breaking ball for strikes at any point in the count.Among the NUMBER pitching crop, PERSON is the best bet to reach his ceiling and likely will be the first starter to appear in the big leagues.",1
"PERSON impressed during his full-season debut in NUMBER but struggled mightily in his next two seasons, both with Double-A Arkansas. The former first-rounder went unprotected and unpicked in the NUMBER Rule NUMBER Draft, but a move back down to the GPE League in NUMBER appears to have helped him right the ship. When he's at his best, PERSON puts himself in a good position to hit and can drive the ball to all fields. He spent two seasonsout of sorts at the plate, with his approach suffering, which in turn limited his power and increased the swings and misses. During his turnaround, his timing improved and he was getting into better hitting counts more consistently. That and his refound confidence have come at the perfect time. Thanks to his makeup, PERSON never took his offensive problems into the field, remaining a talented defender at third base, with a strong arm and good hands. Still only NUMBER, PERSON has re-emerged with plenty of time to fulfill the promise that made him a first-round pick back in NUMBER.",1
"Ever since the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON seven figures to sign in NUMBER, they knew they had a hitter on their hands, one who could be a .NUMBER-average type in the big leagues one day. It hasn't come that quickly, though he still will be just NUMBER for the NUMBER season. PERSON had NUMBER plate appearances in NUMBER, a career high for him. He did a lot with them, showing the ability to hit for average and power. Granted, it was in ORGANIZATION, one of the best places in the Minors to hit, but he did make some progress on the plate discipline front. He's played all three outfield positions, but will likely end up in a corner where, if he can stay healthy, he'll be able to prove his bat was not a product of his environment in NUMBER.",0
"A candidate to go ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall in the NUMBER Draft before slumping as an ORGANIZATION State junior, PERSON fell to the ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. NUMBER and signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million. Considered one of the best defensive college shortstops in years, he has lived up to that reputation as a pro. He made his big league debut last summer and played regularly at third base in the final two weeks of the season after PERSON came down with pneumonia.PERSON is a potential ORGANIZATION shortstop with smooth actions, range to both sides, soft hands and an arm capable of making any throw necessary. Though he made a career-high NUMBER errors at shortstop in NUMBER, he's usually a reliable defender with a .NUMBER fielding percentage at the position through four pro seasons. Because he's hopelessly blocked by ORGANIZATION, GPE began playing PERSON at second and third base last year to prepare him for a possible utility role.PERSON showed offensive promise early in his college days and hit well in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, but he had the worst offensive season of his pro career last year before declining further in NUMBER. He won't ever be more than a bottom-of-the-order hitter because he doesn't produce much power, and his contact and on-base ability have diminished as he has tried to do too much. He has average speed and good baserunning instincts.",1
"A NUMBERth-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of high school in NUMBER, PERSON opted not to sign and instead honored his commitment to GPE, where he pitched for one season before transferring to PERSON and sitting out for all of 'NUMBER. Taken by GPE in the NUMBERnd round the following year, PERSON is looking like a Draft steal after making steady progress in each pro season en route to his first taste of Double-A in NUMBER.A two-sport standout who could have played college basketball, PERSON's tremendous athleticism translates and gives him big upside on the mound. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER right-hander has an exceptional sinker -- it has an average spin rate of about NUMBER rpm -- that sits in the low NUMBERs and nets him ground balls at an elite clip. His NUMBER.NUMBER percent ground-ball rate in NUMBER was tops among qualified starters in the ORGANIZATION' farm system and ranked inside the top NUMBER in the entire Minors. PERSON pairs his heater with a quality changeup, giving him two above-average offerings, and the ORGANIZATION have been pleased with his development of a slider.PERSON possesses average control and command because his athleticism allows him to repeat his delivery and arm action so well. That feel for pounding the zone allows for PERSON's three-pitch mix to play up, and he's never had issues keeping the ball in the park. PERSON is still a work-in-progress, and therefore his ceiling is still coming into view, but his impressive development and remaining projection portends to at least a back-end starter role at the highest level.",0
"Since signing him with an over-slot deal in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION didn't hesitate to challenge PERSON a bit, sending him to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League for his debut, largely against much older competition. Then he spent the NUMBER season in full-season ball at age NUMBER and while his overall numbers were mixed, he finished very strongly, with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA over his final nine starts. The big right-hander could have three above-average-or-better pitches and above-average command when all is said and done. PERSON will touch NUMBER mph with his fastball, with plenty of movement. His changeup has deceptive sink, and it's been his best secondary offering in the past. His curve may have caught up, and the power breaking ball might be just as good down the road. The ORGANIZATION were very aggressive in going after high-ceiling high school arms in the past few Drafts and PERSON has the chance to be one of the best from that effort.",0
"PERSON spent two summers in the ORGANIZATION after signing out of the GPE in NUMBER. The slightly undersized right-hander didn't disappoint in his highly anticipated stateside debut in NUMBER, when he showed the ability to miss bats with electric stuff en route to recording NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts per nine innings in the Rookie-level PERSON. The ORGANIZATION expected big things from him in NUMBER, though he was unable to take the next step as an avulsion fracture in his elbow limited him to just NUMBER innings. He finally made his full-season debut in NUMBER, pitching as part of a loaded piggyback starting rotation at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin. In December, he was selected by the Twins with the first pick in the Rule NUMBER Draft, only to be traded to GPE.  When healthy, PERSON's lightning-quick arm generates a fastball in the mid-NUMBERs with late movement from a high three-quarters slot. His slider, thrown in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with good lateral action, has the chance to be an out pitch if he can throw it for strikes. His changeup lags behind his two other offerings, but club officials believe it will become an effective third pitch for him once he creates better velocity separation relative to his heater. He has the ability to miss bats naturally, though his control and command require refinement, as does his mechanics. PERSON's elbow injury required subsequent surgery, but he was not limited by the injury in NUMBER. Although the ORGANIZATION may continue to develop him as a starter, his fastball-slider pairing gives him undeniable upside in a late-inning bullpen role.",1
"Mostly a reliever in his first two college seasons, PERSON has been PERSON's most effective starter in NUMBER. That's quite an accomplishment, considering he shares the rotation with former first-rounder PERSON and NUMBER freshman of the year PERSON. The ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year, PERSON can't match their pure stuff but could go in the top five rounds as a southpaw with savvy.All three of PERSON's pitches can make a case for being his best. As a starter, he has ranged from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with a fastball that plays above its velocity because it has lots of sink and he pounds the bottom of the strike zone with it. His three-quarters breaking ball and his changeup both can be solid offerings at their best.PERSON hides the ball well with his three-quarters delivery and throws quality strikes, so batters rarely seem to square up his pitches. He hit NUMBER mph and showed a sharper breaker while posting a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA as a reliever last year, though he also missed almost six weeks with an arm strain. He profiles as a back-of-the-rotation starter or a middle-relief option.",0
"While he might best be known right now as the guy who had said he hated the ORGANIZATION in a video recorded well before he was drafted by them, PERSON has the stuff to make a big name for himself on the mound. The ORGANIZATION area high school standout has the chance to have a very good three-pitch mix from the left side. He'll throw his fastball up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph and will complement it with a solid power curve. His changeup should give him a third pitch that's at least PERSON average and he projects to have above-average command of his arsenal when all is said and done.",0
"Over his first two seasons at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON struggled to put up decent numbers, getting hit and not missing a ton of bats. A very strong showing last summer in the ORGANIZATION changed his trajectory and the southpaw has continued to pitch well in the ORGANIZATION' weekend rotation.The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER southpaw does have room to add some strength and thus has some projection, though the pitchability lefty thing is working for him this spring. He commands his fastball, which sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range in most starts, often touching NUMBER mph. His above-average changeup, thrown with excellent deception and late sink, is his best secondary offering. On the GPE, his breaking stuff was solid, but it's been not quite as sharp back in school. He has shown a solid slider and fringy curve, though they lack real bite at times.With his size, relatively easy delivery, ability to throw strikes and solid stuff, many feel PERSON has the tools to start long-term. Others feel he's destined to be a fastball-changeup reliever. A team that believes the former is likely to be the one to take him in the top three rounds.",0
"PERSON began his incredible run in NUMBER by winning the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, and he ended it by winning the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION. In between, the ORGANIZATION made him the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick, and he crushed pitching everywhere he went. That continued as PERSON battled for the NUMBER Minor League home run lead all season long.PERSON has well-above-average power, and he drives the ball to all fields. There is some swing-and-miss in his game, but he has worked to eliminate some of the holes in his swing, and he projects to be able to hit for a good average.PERSON has a strong arm, and he's more athletic than his large frame would suggest. He should be able to stay at third base, but he played some outfield in college, and he'd be able to handle a move to right field if necessary. PERSON wowed in his professional debut, and GPE likely won't have to wait long for him to get to GPE.",1
"The curvaceous GPE outfielder has a perfectly fine collection of average tools, but the bat control is a little lacking and detracts enough from ORGANIZATION's production that he'll likely max out as a low-end regular rather than an impact everyday hitter. PERSON corner bats with fringe contact skills need to walk a lot and/or hit for huge power, and ORGANIZATION doesn't seem capable of that. He probably fits as a bench outfielder in the ORGANIZATION mold.",0
"MLBPipeline.com's top-rated prospect in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON was the first high school player selected and went third overall to the ORGANIZATION. After signing for a franchise-record $NUMBER.NUMBER million, he had a respectable pro debut against older competition in the Rookie-level PERSON, though he missed roughly half the season with a variety of leg injuries. After dedicating himself to strength and conditioning work during his first pro offseason, he has stayed healthy in NUMBER and performed well as a teenager in low Class A.With his lightning bat speed and strength, PERSON generates plus power with an easy right-handed stroke. He doesn't sell out for homers and uses the entire field, which should allow him to hit for a solid average as well. PERSON has the potential to put up similar offensive numbers to former franchise icon PERSON, whom PERSON traded to GPE last summer. PERSON is a fine athlete with average speed and solid arm strength. Scouts who saw him as an amateur were split on whether he'll stay at shortstop, though most gave him credit for soft hands and good instincts. PERSON could become an above-average shortstop and also has gotten some exposure to second base this season.",0
"PERSON has the potential to be the biggest Draft steal in the organization. A top-five-round talent as a GPE high schooler in NUMBER, he dropped to the NUMBERth round amid signability concerns but gave up a commitment to Nebraska-Omaha to sign for well over slot at $NUMBER,NUMBER. PERSON surgery in June NUMBER sidelined him for most of last year, but he impressed enough during five brief Minor League appearances and instructional league to claim a spot on the NUMBER-man roster.PERSON has the makings of a top-of-the-rotation talent, beginning with a fastball that ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER mph. Though his curveball needs more consistency, it can be an absolute hammer at times. His changeup is more of a work in progress but shows solid potential.While his upside is apparent, PERSON needs to establish health and consistency. He hasn't had much success as a pro because he struggles to command and control his pitches. Though he has scuffled in high Class A this year, the ORGANIZATION believe he'll start improving as he gains more experience.",0
"The ORGANIZATION may have given up their NUMBER first-round pick to sign free agent PERSON, but they still got a first-round talent with their top choice (second round) in PERSON. He starred in three years at ORGANIZATION, leading the NUMBER national championship team in hitting (.NUMBER) and slugging (.NUMBER) as a freshman, helping the ORGANIZATION finish second at the NUMBER College World Series and ranking second in the LOCATION with a NUMBER.NUMBER OPS during his Draft year. He's continued to perform in pro ball, batting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER during his first year-plus before he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in the January PERSON deal.A switch-hitter, PERSON has a smooth stroke with good bat speed from both sides. Some scouts wonder if he'll make consistent hard contact against quality pitching, but PERSON was impressed with his ability to make adjustments during his debut. He has begun to drive the ball more consistently and should have at least average power, and he has shown a knack for drawing walks in the past.PERSON knows how to use his solid speed to his advantage on the bases and in center field. He gets good jumps and he should be able to stay in center. He's an average defender there and better on the corners, where he fits better in left field because he has a below-average arm.",0
"Last fall, PERSON went off at the ORGANIZATION Game WWBA World Championships in GPE, Fla., last fall, in front of a lot of decision-makers. The GPE clearly remembered that, and liked what they saw this spring to give him full pick value in the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft. The GPE high school product is a big risk, big reward kind of high school bat, one with a ton of raw power. He showed flashes of it during a rain-soaked senior season, but not with the consistency he showed in GPE. He does have the ability to make loud contact and hit for power to all fields. PERSON's offensive profile fits best in right field and he does throw enough to be able to stay there. He's not overly athletic, but he's far from a sloth on the bases and in the outfield. PERSON showed he can perform well against good competition. He'll now get to work with the GPE on proving he can do it on a consistent basis.",0
"PERSON bounced between the rotation and bullpen during his first three years at ORGANIZATION State before carving out a role as a full-time reliever in NUMBER and becoming a NUMBERth-round pick of the ORGANIZATION in June. He split his first full season between the ORGANIZATION, where he was a midseason All-Star, and the GPE, and then spent all of NUMBER pitching out of the bullpen for Double-A Arkansas. Following the season, PERSON represented the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION. A tall and physical right-hander, PERSON employs a clean delivery with short arm action on the backside that causes his NUMBER-NUMBER mph four-seam fastball to jump on opposing hitters. His slider represents a second average-or-better offering, registering at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with late, hard sweeping action. PERSON demonstrates confidence and feel for locating both pitches, especially the slider, though his current command profile leaves something to be desired. PERSON experienced a dip in his strikeout rate with the move up to the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, but the right-hander still showed the ability to miss bats on both sides of the plate with his fastball-slider combo. That quality, as well as better fastball command, could lead to a seventh-inning role at the highest level.",0
"GPE seems to produce an enticing, projectable high school arm in just about every Draft, and GPE fit that profile when he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a third-rounder in NUMBER. PERSON didn't bring him to full-season ball until his fourth pro season, giving him time to add strength and improve his pitches. His stuff ticked up at the end of NUMBER, when he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in nine Double-A starts, and the ORGANIZATION landed him in December as the headline prospect in a three-team deal that shipped PERSON to the A's and lefty prospect PERSON to PERSON has boosted his fastball velocity and his ability to maintain it since turning pro, now working at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and topping out at NUMBER with some running action. He has some power and late bite with his slider, which has developed into a solid second offering. He also has some feel for throwing a fading changeup, which he continues to refine in order to combat right-handers.GPE had scattershot control coming out of high school but is doing a much better job of throwing strikes now. He still needs to refine his location in order to reach his ceiling as a mid-rotation starter. He has deception in his delivery that makes it difficult for hitters to square his pitches up.",1
"The ORGANIZATION landed a number of promising hitters in the later rounds of the NUMBER Draft, most notably outfielders PERSON (seventh round), PERSON (NUMBERth) and PERSON (NUMBERth) and third baseman PERSON (eighth).

A recurring hamstring injury has slowed him in his first full season.PERSON has a big league body at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER pounds and the athleticism to match. His three homers in NUMBER games at ORGANIZATION last spring belied his plus raw power, which manifested itself in game production more often in pro ball. He makes consistent contact to all fields and the ball jumps off his right-handed bat, which generates some of the best exit velocities among GPE farmhands.PERSON's well-above-average speed plays better on the bases than it does in the outfield, where his reads and jumps can be shaky. He played center field in junior college but mostly on the corners in his debut. He has fringy arm strength, so he'll be best suited for left field unless he can hone his instincts and return to center.",0
"Sturdily built and athletic lefty with a good arm action and repeatable delivery. ORGANIZATION commands his low-NUMBERs fastball to both sides of the plate and has a mature ability to locate his fastball and future above average curveball to various effective locales. PERSON action portends changeup projection (it already flashes at least average) and he's working on a cutter, but his velo has been down recently. Offensively, ORGANIZATION has an easy, lofty swing and at least plus raw power and teams are intrigued by what he might do if focused on hitting full time.",0
"PERSON's exciting GPE debut in NUMBER, followed by his ability to hold his own in the LOCATION League in NUMBER, has the organization excited about his potential to become an everyday shortstop, even if it's way off in the future.Signed in NUMBER, PERSON performed very well in the short-season PERSON in 'NUMBER. A left-handed-hitting shortstop, he has good bat speed at the plate, though added strength and a better knowledge of the strike zone will help his offensive game. PERSON has excellent speed, which should help him on both sides of the ball. He has the range and the arm to stay at shortstop long-term. PERSON is not going to move PERSON off of shortstop anytime soon, and the ORGANIZATION will be sure not to rush him, but PERSON does give GPE a middle infielder who will definitely stick at the premium position long-term.",0
"A NUMBERth-round pick by the ORGANIZATION from a GPE high school in NUMBER, PERSON struggled as a ORGANIZATION freshman before breaking out in NUMBER.

He carried it over into his junior season before a broken hamate bone shelved him for a while.PERSON packs a lot of strength in his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound frame and his well above-average pop extends to all fields. He can get too aggressive at times, though he does a nice job of shortening and controlling his left-handed swing. While he has arm strength and has played right field as a sophomore and junior, PERSON likely faces a move back to his freshman position of first base in pro ball. He's a well below-average runner but has the hands and enough athleticism to be a capable defender at first.A hamate injury won't deflate PERSON's stock and he still has the chance to join PERSON (NUMBER) and PERSON (NUMBER) as the only BC first-rounders ever.",0
"GPE burst on the scene with the Dodgers by making his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER and pitching extremely well. His followup in the GPE League didn't go nearly as well, and the first part of his NUMBER season was up and down, but his youth, stuff and size are all likely reasons the PERSON wanted him as part of the deal for PERSON in July. He has a live arm and a free and easy delivery, which brings fastballs that touch NUMBER mph with good movement. His secondary stuff is more inconsistent, though he's shown glimpses of a strong, tilting slider and an effective changeup. The ball jumps out of his hand, and if he can learn to command the ball within the strike zone more effectively, he still has the chance to get back on track.",0
"Though PERSON helped ORGANIZATION win the GPE NUMBER-A state title and finish No. NUMBER in the final national rankings in NUMBER, he didn't live up to expectations at the plate and concerned teams with his commitment to PERSON. Thus the ORGANIZATION were able to draft him in the NUMBERth round, where they signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER. After a lackluster debut, he was one of the best hitters in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-League as an NUMBER-year-old last summer before he tore a thumb ligament in July.With his hand-eye coordination and all-fields approach, PERSON should hit for average. He shows promising patience and a willingness to use the whole field. Though he hit just one homer in NUMBER games during his first two pro seasons, he has the bat speed and strength to hit at least NUMBER longballs per season as he gets stronger. PERSON has below-average speed but moves well enough to play on the outfield corners rather than at first base. He has a solid arm that delivered low-NUMBERs fastballs when he was a two-way player in high school.",0
"As one of the best high school power arms in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON projected as a possible first-rounder before he hurt his elbow that PERSON. The injury ultimately required PERSON surgery, though that didn't dissuade the ORGANIZATION from paying him $NUMBER.NUMBER million in the sixth round. That gamble could pay off big, as he has more upside than any pitcher in GPE's farm system.PERSON reached NUMBER mph with his fastball before he got hurt and hit NUMBER shortly after he returned to the mound last summer. He sits in the mid-NUMBERs with his heater, which also features life that makes it even tougher to barrel. He has turned what was a three-quarters breaking ball into a true power curveball that one club official likened to PERSON Gooden's.Like most young pitchers with rocket arms, PERSON needs to refine his changeup and use it more. Though he's not very physical, he's able to generate premium stuff with athleticism and arm speed rather than excessive effort in his delivery. The ORGANIZATION have helped him clean up his mechanics some and he should be able to repeat them efficiently enough to fill the strike zone.",0
"One of the best high school position prospects in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON saw his chances of going in the first round disappear when he tore the meniscus in his right knee in a season-opening doubleheader. The ORGANIZATION made a serious run at him after selecting him in the NUMBERnd round, but they couldn't divert him from attending ORGANIZATION. After three strong seasons for the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION made PERSON the highest-drafted position player to come out of ORGANIZATION since PERSON in NUMBER by selecting him in the second round in June. PERSON does a nice job of controlling the strike zone and using the opposite field. He has the bat speed and strength to provide average power and shows it during batting practice, though his current approach is geared more to line-drive contact. PERSON has solid speed but isn't as quick as he was in high school, when he set a GPE national NUMBER-and-under team record with five steals in one game.Though he has lost a step, PERSON gets the job done in center field and exhibits good jumps and routes on fly balls. He has a decent arm and makes accurate throws. Meanwhile, PERSON's game continues to draw parallels to that his head coach at ORGANIZATION, PERSON, the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick in NUMBER.",0
"GPE was a solid senior sign in the NUMBERth round in NUMBER as a Friday starter for PERSON. In that role, he had a TrackMan-friendly rising fastball that sat NUMBER-NUMBER and hit NUMBER mph occasionally, and he relied heavily on an above average-flashing breaking ball, fringy command, and average control to post numbers against weaker competition. After signing, the ORGANIZATION put him in the bullpen and his velocity immediately ticked up in shorter stints, working NUMBER-NUMBER and hitting NUMBER mph. His control and command got a bit worse, and he hasn't quite struck the balance in his delivery and approach between newfound power stuff and control, but he could find himself on the shortlist for big league bullpen contention if and when he does.",0
"This LOCATION product and PERSON are the top high school middle infielders in the country in this class.Well-known on the showcase circuit, PERSON has a plus arm and easy, flowing motions defensively. While he grades out as an average runner, he is a threat on the bases. PERSON has a loose, wristy stroke and can hit the ball to all fields. He has average raw power and could grow into more as he matures.PERSON's stock slipped a bit this spring as some scouts questioned his hitting tools. How high he goes in the ORGANIZATION may depend on how much teams feel his bat will come, though it's fairly certain someone will take the chance in helping him develop given his outstanding defensive skills up the middle.",0
"During college, PERSON was used primarily as a reliever, but both at ORGANIZATION and in two summers in the ORGANIZATION. After drafting him in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION gave him a chance to start, but they scrapped that plan in NUMBER. His fastball plays up out of the bullpen and has touched the upper-NUMBERs. More typically, PERSON throws in the low- to mid-NUMBERs and mixes his fastball with a hard curveball. He throws from a good downhill angle and gets lots of groundballs as a result. Dating back to college, however, PERSON has suffered from control problems, stemming from his extreme overhand arm action and unorthodox delivery. If he can improve his command, PERSON would fit well into the back of a Major League bullpen.",0
"PERSON was thought by many to be unsignable as a two-sport standout, one who had a scholarship to LOCATION to play quarterback. But the ORGANIZATION were creative with their Draft pool and managed to sign the athletic outfielder, who got in a handful of ORGANIZATION League games before heading to school to play football. He appeared in nine games for LOCATION, starting five. PERSON has considerable raw tools, with a Reggie Sanders-like upside, but hasn't had the opportunity to refine them with his focus split among two sports. His approach at the plate isn't bad and he has the chance to have above-average power in the future. He has plus speed that should allow him to be a threat on the bases as well as a solid defensive outfielder. It's going to take longer as he continues to play two sports, but the wait could be worth it.",0
"When PERSON debuted with PERSON last April, he became the first member of his baseball family to play in the big leagues. His grandfather PERSON managed the ORGANIZATION and GPE for parts of his six season and his father PERSON was a ORGANIZATION first-round pick in the secondary phase of the NUMBER January Draft.Kolten Wong's double-play partner at ORGANIZATION and in the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON is a steady defender. He has smooth actions and reliable hands, allowing him to play anywhere in the infield. His average arm is stretched a bit on the left side of the diamond, making second base his best position.PERSON hits for a decent average with a little bit of pop and a few walks thrown in. He has some bat speed but lacks a high offensive ceiling, making him better suited as a utilityman than a potential regular. His makeup and versatility could make him useful in a bench role.",1
"The son of former ORGANIZATION general manager PERSON, PERSON had an outstanding professional debut after being selected in the eighth round of the NUMBER Draft. He continued that in NUMBER, reaching Double-A Mississippi in his first full professional season before being dealt to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in November.PERSON has a line-drive swing and uses his plus speed to get on base. He is an aggressive baserunner and has good instincts. PERSON doesn't have much power, but he is strong enough to drive the ball into gaps and allow his speed to turn those into extra-base hits. He is a solid defender and can play all three outfield positions, though he needs to improve his routes.PERSON has shown his summer debut wasn't an aberration, and he looks like a good bet to become a fourth outfielder, if not more.",0
"PERSON had a seven-figure asking price coming out of high school, which was just out of reach of what clubs were willing to commit from their spending pools. He was set to head to PERSON until a late coaching change caused him to reconsider his commitment, and the ORGANIZATION ultimately lost him to GPE (and PERSON to PERSON). PERSON's velocity ticked up before he even played in an official game for the GPE, sitting NUMBER-NUMBER and hitting NUMBER mph in preseason scrimmages before his freshman year. He kept that velocity throughout his college career and developed a plus changeup. 
The two issues for PERSON are his very short stride, which causes his velocity to play down, and his breaking ball, which is not great. It's still most often a below average pitch, with curveball velocity and three-quarters slider shape. Cogent pitch design may help the pitch, or indicate the ORGANIZATION should just scrap it altogether and try something like a cutter or slider. These issues are almost identical to PERSON's coming out of PERSON; he's appeared to have solved those at times, though not at others.",0
"Sometimes repeating a level can do wonders for a prospect's career. Case in point is PERSON, who had to go back to the GPE League after scuffling there in NUMBER. The former ORGANIZATION farmhand, who came to the D-backs in the three-team trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION, hit his way out of the level in NUMBER and kept on performing well in Double-A, all at the age of NUMBER. However, his progress was slowed in NUMBER by a shoulder injury that kept him out of action for a couple of months. PERSON excels with an innate ability to find the barrel of the bat, especially from the left side of the plate. He's a free swinger with tremendous hand-eye coordination, but one of the keys to his step forward last season was improved plate discipline and a better walk rate. That allowed him to increase his extra-base output, and he could eventually be a NUMBER-NUMBER home run kind of hitter. PERSON has played more shortstop than anywhere else since joining the organization and can make all the plays there. He's also shown the ability to play a more-than-capable second base. PERSON raised the bar a bit following his first full season in the organization but didn't get to replicate it because of injury in NUMBER. He still has the potential to be an everyday shortstop, but he could also move around to create more opportunities to get his bat into the lineup once he's ready for the big leagues.",0
"PERSON was regarded highly by scouts for his athleticism and multi-sport background (baseball/football) as a prep before he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as a second-round pick in NUMBER. He finally graduated to the Triple-A level in NUMBER, only to become a Minor League free agent following the season. He latched on with the GPE to begin NUMBER but didn't last long with the organization and ultimately finished the year in the ORGANIZATION' system. A free agent once again after the season, PERSON signed a Minor League deal with the Marlins in November.PERSON has shown flashes of promise but has never put all the pieces together, partly due to him making seven separate trips to the disabled list since the outset of his career. He makes hard contact and uses the entire field, but offers little in the way of over-the-fence pop. As a right-handed hitter, PERSON's greatest strength is his ability to hit lefty pitchers. He's long struggled against same-side hurlers, though, in turn limiting his utility as a potential everyday player.PERSON is average both as a runner and a defender and continues to see time at all three outfield spots, but his fringy arm strength likely is best suited for left field at the highest level. It's been a long, arduous climb through the Minors for the NUMBER-year-old, but there's a chance he could get his first taste of the big leagues before the end of the season.",0
"The first time he was eligible for the GPE, PERSON faltered as a high school senior in NUMBER and dropped from a potential third-round choice to the point where he wasn't signable and lasted NUMBER rounds. He has fared much better in his second chance this spring, following lackluster freshman and sophomore years with an undefeated regular season as a junior.PERSON's fastball faded a little bit toward the end of the spring, but he's capable of pitching at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reaching NUMBER. His heater appears quicker because he unleashes it with an easy delivery, and its riding life helps it play up further. He does a nice job of maintaining his arm speed on his changeup, giving him a second solid pitch. PERSON's low-NUMBERs slider can rate as average, though it gets slurvy at times. He's built for durability but his lack of a true plus offering limits his ceiling to a back-of-the-rotation role. He'll need to refine his control and command to be effective as a starter in pro ball.",0
"PERSON was a solid mid-tier prep prospect in the ORGANIZATION suburbs who a couple of clubs really liked, but they ultimately couldn't meet his price, pushing him to ORGANIZATION. He made the leap between his sophomore and junior years, growing into his athleticism and developing plus raw power along with above average defensive tools and arm strength. The defensive tools are especially rare for a catcher of PERSON's size, as it's much easier for a more compact-framed player to excel behind the plate. PERSON has the rare ability to slow the game down defensively and scouts rave about his makeup, game calling, and game preparation. 
At the plate, PERSON has big power and gets to it pretty often in games, particularly to his pull side, where he hit a majestic shot that was never found over the facade of the football complex in left field at ORGANIZATION's stadium. But while he is exceptional behind the plate, PERSON doesn't have the same ability to slow the game at it, however, with elevated strikeout rates in his draft year and just okay pitch selection. The bat speed is good and he doesn't have trouble against velocity, and some scouts point to his solid pro debut as evidence that PERSON was just frustrated by being pitched around and developed some bad habits in college. Since literally everything else you could want except for contact is already present, most assume that PERSON will figure out a way to get to a NUMBER to NUMBER bat with above average game power and above average defense, even if it's on the job in the big leagues in NUMBER. He broke his hand early in NUMBER and will miss several weeks. He's a strong ORGANIZATION possibility.",0
"GPE's early-season domincane of Double-A should be taken with a grain of salt as he was significantly older than is usual for prospect at that level. As a left fielder, his bat might fall just shy of profiling and he could be best used as a utility or platoon option.",0
"Named ORGANIZATION of the NUMBER Cape Cod League, ORGANIZATION led PERSON to a ORGANIZATION regional title the following year while ranking second in the nation in hitting, and then became the highest-drafted player in school history when PERSON selected him with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. He was limited to only NUMBER games during his professional debut due to injury as he underwent surgery to repair a partially torn right labrum in October, and then had arthroscopic surgery the following February to clean up the same shoulder. ORGANIZATION did not appear in a game in NUMBER.ORGANIZATIONw finally healthy, ORGANIZATION has begun to show some of the offensive potential that made him a first-round pick in NUMBER. The right-handed hitter utilizes a short, compact swing to spray line drives from line to line, and he still possesses the raw power he showed before the injury.ORGANIZATION's blend of athleticism and tools gives him a high floor behind the plate, but his arm strength obviously is a concern going forward, with a pair of shoulder surgeries to his name. As a result, he's exclusively served as PERSON's designated hitter in NUMBER, and there's no timetable for when he might resume catching duties.",0
"PERSON starred for three seasons at ORGANIZATION, going NUMBER-NUMBER with NUMBER strikeouts (second-most in school history) and appearing in two College World Series. His velocity decreased during his junior year in NUMBER and caused him to drop toward the end of the first round, and he signed for a slightly below-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER after a post-Draft physical raised concerns about his back. His stuff stayed down in his first full pro season but has rebounded somewhat in NUMBER and had advanced to Double-A when the ORGANIZATION sent him, along with PERSON, to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.PERSON had one of the best curveballs in the NUMBER Draft, and while it's still often his best pitch, it's not quite the low-NUMBERs hammer he had at ORGANIZATION. His fastball is back up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph after ranging from NUMBER-NUMBER mph in NUMBER, though he never has commanded his heater particularly well. He improved his fading changeup when he had to use it more often out of necessity, and he also has picked up a cutter.Even when PERSON was thriving in college, scouts questioned the effort in his delivery and some projected him as a reliever. He may never have more than average control or command, a problem for a pitcher without much margin for error. His competitiveness allows him to get the most out of his ability, though he has looked like a back-of-the-rotation starter early in his pro career.",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON enough to give him a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER, but after he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his first three pro seasons, they gave him to the FACILITY for two months of PERSON. He started to make progress during his year in GPE's system, then really blossomed in NUMBER following a trade to the Rockies in exchange for PERSON. PERSON led GPE farmhands with NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings and pitched well in five late-season starts in Double-A.Drafted as a projectable right-hander who topped out at NUMBER mph in high school, PERSON has gained NUMBER pounds since turning pro and now sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reaches NUMBER with some sink on his fastball. His mid-NUMBERs slider is harder than it is sharp but can be a plus pitch at times. He'll also flash an average changeup, though it lacks consistency.PERSON has a durable build, throws strikes and keeps the ball down in the zone. He has all the ingredients to fit in the middle of the rotation and shouldn't require much more development time. If for some reason he doesn't make it as a starter, he could be a high-leverage reliever whose stuff shows even more power in shorter stints.",0
"GPE has a NUMBER rpm curveball and low-NUMBERs sinker, and he hides the ball pretty well and Kâd NUMBER hitters in NUMBER innings at Low-A last year. Because heâs a cold-weather college arm, itâs a little more acceptable that he performed that way at NUMBER, and we think heâs an interesting sleeper who might get pushed quickly this year.",0
"You can copy and paste the ORGANIZATION report into this space, as PERSON also wields an imbalanced but promising offensive profile comprised of tremendious raw power and enough walking to make up for all the strikeouts. PERSON has now been this type of hitter up through Double-A and his offensive profile is pretty stable. He turns NUMBER at the end of May and will likely spend much of NUMBER at Triple-A. The presence of PERSON and PERSON make PERSON a potential trade chip.",0
"PERSON has progressed steadily through the system after signing out of GPE for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER. Even with his development slowed by a high ankle sprain this year, he's on the verge of reaching the ORGANIZATION. Yet it remains to be seen whether PERSON will be an everyday player or a fourth outfielder.An extremely patient hitter, PERSON diligently works counts and uses the entire field. Scouts believe he can be too passive at times, however, and would like to see him try to drive balls more often. PERSON needs to get stronger, as well, or else he might be pegged as more of a tweener than a regular.PERSON' speed, arm and defensive ability are all fine, but he presently lacks the power to fit on an outfield corner or the quickness to start in center. While his skills are best suited for left field, he's capable of playing all three spots.",1
"Fuentes is a NUMBERB/NUMBERB with plus power and some swing and miss issues, problems that will likely relegate him to bench/platoon duty in the big leagues.",0
"Rather than sign with the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-rounder out of high school in NUMBER, PERSON opted to play defensive back for PERSON's football team. He took two years off to complete a Mormon mission and didn't return to baseball until NUMBER, when he showed enough athleticism and upside for the GPE to sign him for $NUMBER million as a third-round pick. Three years later, PERSON still has impressive tools but remains raw at the plate. He struggles to command the strike zone, so he gets himself out too often, and his strength doesn't translate into power as much as it should. He's also not on base enough to take advantage of his well above-average speed, which allowed him to succeed on NUMBER percent of his steals attempts in his first three pro seasons.PERSON has made obvious improvements with his defense, strengthening his arm and improving his jumps and routes to become a plus center fielder. He may never live up to the PERSON and PERSON comparisons that he entered pro ball with, and an outfield logjam awaits him in GPE, but PERSON could become a valuable fourth outfielder if he can get his bat going.",0
"PERSON didn't sign as a NUMBERnd rounder last year for unclear reasons and has had an up-and-down senior year, but his stuff was a little better down the stretch, likely allowing PERSON to go in the NUMBERnd round again but now with less leverage and at nearly NUMBER years old.",0
"After three productive years at ORGANIZATION, where he looked very much like a future center fielder and leadoff type hitter, GPE was a ORGANIZATION B pick of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. As good as he was in college, he was tough to see as a pro, missing nearly all of the NUMBER season and half of NUMBER with injuries, though he did make up for some lost time with a dominant turn in the GPE ORGANIZATION after the 'NUMBER season. The ORGANIZATION, who loved his speed and defense in ORGANIZATION, loved what they did see when he was on the field and were sure to get him as part of the deal that sent PERSON to PERSON this past offseason.One question facing GPE when he entered pro ball was whether he would be physical enough at the plate. While he only got NUMBER at-bats in NUMBER, he showed the ability to drive the ball with extra-base authority, especially to his pull side. His legs and his glove are still his carrying tools and he has more than enough ability to stick in center field long term, albeit with a below-average arm. He has basestealing ability as well and should get back to wreaking more havoc when NUMBER percent healthy.Controlling the strike zone and getting on base are still the keys for GPE to profile as a top-of-the-order catalyst. If he can continue to impact the ball like he has at times, there's still time for him to develop into a big league regular.",1
"PERSON made headlines for all the wrong reasons when he threw a nine-inning, NUMBER-pitch complete game at ORGANIZATION (PERSON, Pa.) in May NUMBER. A month later, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the NUMBERth round and gave him $NUMBER,NUMBER to pass up a commitment to GPE. He made such a good impression in his first Spring Training that he earned an assignment to low Class A at age NUMBER, and he continued to stand out before the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the Yu Darvish trade in July.PERSON's best present weapon is his curveball, which has depth and could become a true plus offering once it adds more power. He usually works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball and should add more velocity once he fills out his projectable NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. His changeup is more of a work in progress, but has some potential.He didn't become a full-time pitcher until he was a junior in high school, so PERSON still has room for lots of growth. He has a quick arm and his pitches should continue to improve as he gets stronger and refines his delivery. ORGANIZATION officials praise his competitive nature.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, Torres tends to get overshadowed by fellow middle infielder PERSON in the ORGANIZATION system. He has played more second base the last two years in deference to GPE, a fixture on top-prospect lists, but it's the less heralded Torres who actually has put up better offensive numbers.A switch-hitter with impressive hand-eye coordination, Torres repeatedly barrels the ball from both sides of the plate. He won't have more than modest gap power unless he gets stronger, but he makes consistent contact and draws a few walks. He's a solid runner who's still learning the nuances of basestealing.Torres has enough arm and range to get the job done at shortstop, but he's an above-average defender at second base. He has quick hands and turns the double-play pivot like he has been doing it for years. He also has seen action at third base during the last two seasons, boosting his utility man cred.",0
"Since the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON with the NUMBERrd overall pick in NUMBER, he has acquitted himself well in full-season ball. And his success didn't go unnoticed. He was first a part of the package the ORGANIZATION acquired in exchange for PERSON in December, then flipped to the ORGANIZATION -- along with PERSON -- in a deal for PERSON. PERSON throws his fastball in the low NUMBERs, and he can occasionally add a bit more velocity. He has advanced feel for his changeup, which might be his best pitch. At its best, PERSON's breaking ball is a solid third offering, though it has a tendency to get slurvy.PERSON's whole arsenal plays up, thanks to his control and the good downhill angle he creates. He is built like a prototypical right-hander, and he has the look of a future middle-of-the-rotation workhorse.",1
"A multi-sport high schooler, PERSON drew some Division I football interest from ORGANIZATION teams like ORGANIZATION but transitioned to baseball full time after suffering a torn ORGANIZATION late in his high school career. In every regard he became a contextually toolsy outfielder at ORGANIZATION, posessing a power/speed blend that's rare for prospects in college baseball, let alone the Big Ten. 
While PERSON ran well for a hefty, NUMBER pound former linebacker/fullback, it was assumed that his size would prohibit long term play in center field and that his arm strength would limit him to left. He has worked doggedly to improve both those issues. Weighted ball work has helped improve his arm, and he's now considerably leaner than he was in college. He's also faster, and shags batting practice fly balls with intense focus. He's willed himself to become viable in center field, which gives him a real shot at becoming an everyday player because PERSON has more raw juice than is typical for center fielders. More likely he's the larger half of an outfield platoon or a strong fourth outfielder, but he has already surpassed developmental expectations and may continue to do so.",0
"The ORGANIZATION used their second of two first-round picks in the NUMBER Draft to get ORGANIZATION, selecting him NUMBERst overall after they had previously taken PERSON at ORGANIZATION. NUMBER. Signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million, he topped the Class A ORGANIZATION in strikeouts per nine innings (NUMBER.NUMBER) in his first full pro season before making the jump to Class A Advanced this year. Along with PERSON, he was one of two Top NUMBER Prospects the ORGANIZATION acquired in a four-player package for PERSON in late July.ORGANIZATION shows the makings of an above-average three-pitch mix. He's hit NUMBER mph with his fastball but usually sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with late, arm-side life and some sink. His curveball flashes plus and projects as a swing-and-miss offering at the highest level, and he made strides developing his changeup in NUMBER. A good athlete with a clean and repeatable delivery, ORGANIZATION has battled his control in Class A Advanced and needs to improve the quality of his strikes.At NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, ORGANIZATION is somewhat undersized but still creates good downhill plane toward the plate and keeps the ball in the yard. Both his secondary pitches and his command require further refinement, but the southpaw has all the tools necessary to develop into a quality mid-rotation starting pitcher.",1
"PERSON PERSON surgery sank PERSON's NUMBER season and he's now a NUMBER-year-old who has yet to pitch a meaningful slate of innings above A-ball. He also only throws in the low-NUMBERs/upper-NUMBERs, but he locates it in spots that make it difficult for hitters to punish, and his funky, low-NUMBER/NUMBERs arm slot disorients them, especially lefties. His delivery, fastball command, and ability to dump his curveball in for strikes should be enough for him to deal with lefties and PERSON's best pitch, a late-sinking, bat-missing changeup, could be enough to keep righties at bay. The report reads like a that of fifth starter, a NUMBER FV. But PERSON's age and what might be an innings limit coming off of surgery are at odds with one another, and ideally we'd like a pitcher firmly in his mid-NUMBERs to be a big league lock for NUMBER, so we've shaded down his FV beneath his true evaluation.",0
"Hailing from the same school -- the ORGANIZATION of GPE -- as long-time big leaguer PERSON, PERSON became the highest-drafted player from the GPE college since PERSON went in the first round, signing for pick value in the fourth round and then throwing very well in a relief role during his pro debut.The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER PERSON comes at hitters with a three-quarters slot and has two pitches that could be plus, especially in shorter stints. Pitching out of the bullpen last summer, PERSON was NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball, and he backed it up with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph slider that could be nasty at times. He has shown some feel for a changeup, though it's behind the other two, and he hasn't needed it as much. PERSON threw strikes during his pro debut and missed a ton of bats while also showing an ability to generate ground-ball outs.With an arm action that is short in back, plus the fact that his stuff would tick down after his first few innings, most see PERSON's future in the bullpen, which could fast-track him to the big leagues. The D-backs will likely give him the chance to start at first, at the very least, to let him amass some innings.",0
"Saving nearly $NUMBER million by signing PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER pick, the ORGANIZATION were able to spread their pool money around later in the GPE. Exhibit A of their efforts might be PERSON, the GPE high school right-hander who got $NUMBER.NUMBER million at the start of the second round, nearly $NUMBER million above pick value.PERSON provides an intriguing combination of projectability and pitchability. The ORGANIZATION native has the chance to have three at least above-average pitches in his arsenal. When he's firing on all cylinders, PERSON's fastball will sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, and with his frame, it's easy to dream about increased velocity. His breaking ball can be an out pitch with good bite, one that should develop into a true slider in time. PERSON has a better feel for a changeup than many high school pitchers, and he has shown advanced command for his age. He typically has a free and easy delivery that he repeats well.Some up-and-down performances last spring moved PERSON down some GPE boards. The ORGANIZATION feel that worked to their advantage, allowing them to get a first-round talent in the second round.",0
"PERSON headed to ORGANIZATION in GPE, GPE, certainly wanted to see first-round talent PERSON swing the bat. They weren't complaining when they got two for the price of one when PERSON was on the mound.PERSON's stock went up when he broke out of the gate firing NUMBER mph fastballs. He's been up to NUMBER throughout the spring, exhibiting plus arm strength that allows him to maintain velocity deep into his starts, throwing his fastball with good sink. His slider is a bit inconsistent, but when he finishes right it has the makings of an average breaking ball. His changeup is behind the other two pitches. All of it comes from a strong and athletic NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame and he goes right after ORGANIZATION is committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE and it is believed he needs to go pretty early to sign him away from that commitment. A team that believes in his arm strength might be willing to roll those dice.",0
"PERSON's cousin is PERSON phenom PERSON Jr. -- his uncle is likely future Hall of ORGANIZATION Sr. -- but this PERSON certainly has the chance to make a name for himself. After signing for $NUMBER.NUMBER million in July NUMBER, he made his ORGANIZATION debut in the ORGANIZATION League the following summer, with the organization excited to welcome him stateside.A solid athlete, PERSON is going to grow into a big, strong adult. He has plus bat speed and gets the barrel of the bat through the zone extremely well. While in-game power didn't show up last summer, it's in there, with the chance to have PERSON average pop eventually. While PERSON is a below-average runner, he actually has decent actions defensively at shortstop to go along with a plus arm. That said, most see him outgrowing the position -- not to mention the depth at that position above him in the system -- and needing to move to third, where he did see some action in the ORGANIZATION during his debut. He also split time between short and second during his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER.PERSON has all the tools to be an everyday player, regardless of where on the left side of the infield he calls home long term. If the bat progresses like many think it will, he should profile just fine at the hot corner.",0
"PERSON electrified ORGANIZATION fans in NUMBER, when he did a backflip on ORGANIZATION right after getting drafted NUMBERth overall and played well at two Class A stops at the end of his debut. He still shows glimpses of the high ceiling that earned him a $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER bonus but has struggled for much of his four full pro seasons. In the last two years in Double-A, he has had trouble making consistent contact and missed time with finger, foot and oblique injuries.PERSON' bat speed and strength give him jaw-dropping raw power, but it remains to be seen whether he'll be polished enough as a hitter to make the most of it. His right-handed swing can get out of control at times and his plate discipline regressed in NUMBER after improving the year before. He may never hit for a high average but could produce NUMBER or more homers per year at GPE Cellular Field if he can refine his approach.Coming out of high school, PERSON had solid speed and arm strength. He since has lost a step as he has matured physically and his throwing motion is a bit stiff, so he now fits best in left field after playing primarily in center field in his first two pro seasons.",0
"Taken very late in the GPE, and from a small Division III college in GPE, PERSON entered pro ball without much fanfare or many expectations in NUMBER. Missing all of NUMBER with a back injury didn't help any, but since then, the right-hander has jumped on a faster track up the ORGANIZATION' organizational ladder.Considering the NUMBER season was the first one that saw PERSON pitch a full season, he's come a long way. He pitches mostly off of his fastball and curve, both of which show flashes of being above-average offering. He can add and subtract velocity on his fastball when needed, and his breaking ball has excellent bite with deception. He is generally able to throw strikes with both.His changeup is behind, but he may not need it should he eventually move into a bullpen role, something that seems a possibility. Given how far he's come, a big league career in the bullpen would far exceed expectations.",0
"At ORGANIZATION, GPE sliced his ERA from NUMBER.NUMBER as a freshman to NUMBER.NUMBER as a sophomore to NUMBER.NUMBER as a junior this spring. He cleaned up his delivery, improved his velocity and control and pitched himself into the second round of the GPE, where he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER.After peaking at NUMBER mph with his fastball in NUMBER, GPE now works at NUMBER-NUMBER and tops out at NUMBER. The life on his fastball also has gotten better, and he uses his size and high-three-quarters delivery to throw it on a downhill plane. His slider has taken a step forward as well and shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. With the makings of an average changeup and a strong build, GPE projects as a possible mid-rotation starter. His command isn't nearly as strong as his control, however, so it's possible he could wind up as a late-inning reliever.",0
"ORGANIZATION blew away the ORGANIZATION' brass during a pre-Draft workout in GPE. They made him the highest-drafted prep to come out of GPE, taking him with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick in the NUMBER Draft, and then lured the left-hander away from a Pepperdine commitment with a $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus. After flashing his potential while missing plenty of bats during his full-season debut, ORGANIZATION has struggled in back-to-back years at the Class A Advanced level. ORGANIZATION lost his hugely deceptive low-three quarters slot in 'NUMBER, instead working from a lower slot that diminished the life and action on his pitches and hindered his control. When he's right, ORGANIZATION' NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball has tremendous late movement and sinking action that makes the pitch incredibly tough to barrel, let alone lift. His slider gives him a second plus pitch, one capable of inducing whiffs on both sides of the plate with its significant lateral break, and he'll also flash above average with his changeup, which has good sink and fade.While ORGANIZATION' delivery does concern some in terms of his ability to start long term, his overall athleticism, surprising strength and impressive three-pitch arsenal will at least give him a strong chance to do so.",0
"Signed out of GPE in NUMBER after performing well at the NUMBER-and-under World Cup in GPE, PERSON hit .NUMBER with NUMBER steals between two Rookie-ball stops in his pro debut in NUMBER.PERSON's game is built around well-above-average speed, which makes him dangerous on the bases and allows him to cover ground in center field, where he shows the makings of a future plus defender. At the plate, the switch-hitter has good feel for the barrel from both sides. PERSON will never offer much in the way of power, but he consistently hits the ball on the ground to utilize his wheels.Slightly built and lacking in physicality, PERSON will need to get significantly stronger to handle better pitching at higher levels. He'll require time to develop, but the tools are there for him to become a potential top-of-the-order contributor at a premium position.",0
"PERSON was considered to be the top prep pitcher in the NUMBER Draft class until a sprained ulnar collateral ligament shut him down in early March. The ORGANIZATION made him the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick anyway, signing him to a well-above slot deal. PERSON made one professional appearance before undergoing PERSON surgery. He returned to the mound in July of NUMBER and showed the same premium stuff that first got the attention of scouts. PERSON has gotten stronger as he gets further away from his surgery and has as much potential as any pitcher in the ORGANIZATION. He showed as much in NUMBER, making the ORGANIZATION. PERSON throws his fastball in the mid- to upper-NUMBERs, often reaching NUMBER mph. He throws a hard, NUMBER-to-NUMBER curveball that is almost as good as his fastball. His changeup isn't as well developed as his other two pitches, but it has the potential to be a third above-average Major League offering. He has good command and an advanced feel for pitching.",1
"PERSON had a strong NUMBER (NUMBER innings, NUMBER K, NUMBER BB, NUMBER% GB%) repeating Low-A as a NUMBER-year-old. He's a husky, low-slot, pitchability lefty with a rainbow curveball and average changeup. The changeup may need to get a bit better to keep righties from teeing off on his fastball, but PERSON also hides the ball really well and can throw his curveball for strikes in fastball counts, so perhaps he already does enough to make the lack of velocity matter less. He profiles as an inning-eating No. NUMBER starter or long reliever.",0
"PERSON was a two-sport star in high school, one who could have headed to PERSON A&M as a quarterback, but was signed away from doing so when the ORGANIZATION took him No. NUMBER overall in the NUMBER Draft. While things haven't been all bad -- he did reach Triple-A for the first time in NUMBER -- it hasn't gone quite as well as planned. The ORGANIZATION left him unprotected from the Rule NUMBER Draft this offseason and he went undrafted.The hope had been that PERSON, as he focused on pitching only and matured, would find increased velocity and be a power-type frontline starter. He has both a four- and two-seamer, with the former topping out at around NUMBER mph and the other thrown with decent sink in the low NUMBERs. He's been a groundball pitcher for much of his career, but he gets too reliant on the two-seamer at times. That's not just in relation to his four-seam fastball, but also in terms of how he incorporates his other pitches, a slider that can be above-average and fringy curveball and changeup.As PERSON has struggled, invariable rumors of him returning to football have cropped up. He's committed to baseball and the ORGANIZATION are hoping they can help him maximize all of his pitches and still reach his potential as a big league starter.",1
"A ORGANIZATION teenager who was another big international signing for the GPE, PERSON made his GPE debut in NUMBER, them moved up a notch from the ORGANIZATION to the GPE League in NUMBER. Once a switch-hitter, he now only hits right-handed, using a line-drive, contact-first approach. While power will never be a big part of his game, he does need to add some strength and will have to work to become an average hitter. A solid runner with a strong arm, it might be PERSONâs defense that carries him up the ladder. He has the chance to be an above-average shortstop in the future. How much the bat develops will determine just how prominent a role heâll play once he gets to the highest level.",0
"Many teams liked PERSON as a pitcher heading into the NUMBER GPE. The ORGANIZATION preferred him a position player, and if his pro debut that saw him hit NUMBER home runs in just NUMBER at-bats is any indication, they have the steal of the GPE on their hands.PERSON has the makings of an impact run-producing hitter. While PERSON thought he'd hit for power eventually, the organization was surprised it showed up in games so quickly. The strikeout rate was a bit high, but PERSON also showed a good knowledge of the strike zone, laying off breaking balls that weren't in it. That bodes well for his future as an overall hitter, knowing that some swing and miss will always likely be there. PERSON trimmed down and became more athletic, giving him a better chance to stay at third than initially anticipated. Even if he has to move, his bat would profile well anywhere.The ORGANIZATION haven't produced many homegrown power hitters of late, but they feel PERSON could eventually join the developed-from-within ranks of run-producing bats like PERSON, PERSON and PERSON.",0
"PERSON reportedly had an agreement in place with the ORGANIZATION on a $NUMBER.NUMBER million signing bonus well before the NUMBER international period began, but the deal never came to fruition, which allowed the ORGANIZATION to land the then-NUMBER-year-old for $NUMBER,NUMBER. He then made his GPE debut two years later with PERSON's Rookie-level ORGANIZATION affiliate and advanced to Class A Short Season in NUMBER before joining the ORGANIZATION with PERSON and PERSON as part of the ORGANIZATION trade in December.  The switch-hitting PERSON is more advanced from the left side of the plate, with good contact skills and the ability to drive the ball to the opposite field. And although he's a work in progress as a righty, PERSON did make strides against southpaws in NUMBER. Hitting for power will never be a part of PERSON' game, but his above-average speed should net him plenty of doubles and triples as well as stolen bases.On the other side of the ball, PERSON draws raves for his upside at shortstop, where he projects as a plus defender with plenty of range and arm strength for the position. He also receives high marks for his intensity and leadership, both on and off the field.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as an NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON never really got going offensively in the ORGANIZATION system with the exception of winning the high Class A ORGANIZATION League batting title with a .NUMBER average in NUMBER. After he slumped again in NUMBER, PERSON sold him to the ORGANIZATION this February. He has performed well in Double-A for his new organization, creating hope that he could contribute as backup catcher in the big leagues.When PERSON keeps his right-handed swing from getting too long and doesn't try to pull everything, he can be effective at the plate. He has some pop and draws his share of walks. PERSON has made himself into a decent receiver and has an average arm. He's bigger than most catchers at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, which can hamper his efforts to block pitches in the dirt.",0
"Signed in NUMBER out of GPE, PERSON struggled during his first three years in the ORGANIZATION' system before breaking out in full-season ball in NUMBER. The right-hander dominated at ORGANIZATION A Lansing early in the year to earn a promotion to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Dunedin as well as a spot on the ORGANIZATION's roster in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON at FACILITY in July. PERSON held his own over NUMBER starts in the ORGANIZATION State League, but he also missed fewer bats and wore down physically late in the year.Working from a three-quarters slot, PERSON sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches NUMBER-NUMBER with his fastball. He has natural deception that makes the pitch's velocity play up, and he did a better job of challenging hitters with it last season while also making strides with his command. PERSON has excellent feel for spinning his above-average curveball, while his slider, thrown in the low NUMBERs with late, short break, should be at least fringe-average. PERSON also employs a changeup, though it's well below average and requires considerable refinement, and exhibits average control of his entire arsenal.PERSON began to attack hitters early in the count last season, and the ORGANIZATION hope he can build on that in future seasons. While underwhelming secondaries limit PERSON' upside to that of a No. NUMBER starter, there are some who believe he could be an effective late-inning reliever based on the merits of his fastball and slider.",0
"The ORGANIZATION doubled up on GPE prep hurlers in the NUMBER Draft, taking left-hander PERSON in the first round followed by PERSON in the NUMBERth. While PERSON was the more highly touted prospect at that time, it's been PERSON who has enjoyed the most success as a pro. He impressed during his full-season debut in the Class A ORGANIZATION and built on that performance in NUMBER Class A Advanced GPE, posting a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA that paced all GPE League hurlers with at least NUMBER innings pitched. With PERSON's arrow pointing in the right direction, the ORGANIZATION acquired him, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON from PERSON for outfielder PERSON. PERSON has seen his stuff and overall pitchability improve in each of his four seasons. He compensates for being undersized with a high-spin-rate fastball that sits NUMBER-NUMBER mph and induces whiffs in and above the zone. PERSON's breaking ball is his best secondary pitch, flashing plus at times with late downer action, and he exhibits feel for a promising changeup. His entire arsenal plays up because he's a good strike-thrower, though he's likely to be challenged in that regarded against upper-level hitters.PERSON's swing-and-miss fastball, combined with his two average-or-better secondary offerings, gives him a chance to be successful against hitters on both sides of the plate, which he was in NUMBER. That he's an undersized righty who lacks a plus pitch leads some to peg PERSON as a future reliever, but he's passed every test in his career thus far.",1
"Few players in the ORGANIZATION system have as great a difference between their present ability and future potential than PERSON, who was signed out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. He has spent four consecutive years in GPE ball before he started to show signs of breaking out in NUMBER. That breakout has become a reality for the left-hander this season, as he ranks among the ORGANIZATION leaders in most pitching categories. In GPE, PERSON pitched for the World squad in the ORGANIZATION Game.PERSON is a NUMBER-foot-NUMBER left-hander with a fastball that already reaches NUMBER mph and features nice life. And with room to add even more strength to his large frame, some scouts believe he will eventually sit in the mid-NUMBERs. He has a chance to have two average secondary pitches, with his changeup currently grading better than his slider.Pedromo's control and command are still very much works in progress, but he has enough deception and natural movement to generate whiffs and weak contact even when he missed a spot. As a southpaw who could grow into a mid-NUMBERs fastball, he'll get plenty of opportunity to prove himself as a starter. At the same time, it doesn't take much effort to envision how his stuff might play out of the bullpen.",0
"There is little question the ORGANIZATION have some aptitude in evaluating, drafting and developing college hitters. The big league roster is all you need to see as proof, with PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON serving as perfect examples. ORGANIZATION could be part of the next wave of college bats to impact PERSON's advanced approach at the plate, with excellent plate discipline and a good idea of the strike zone, has helped his transition to pro ball. He has both strength and bat speed from the right side, with the chance to have at least PERSON average in-game power, which was on display as he slugged .NUMBER during his pro debut and reached full-season ball. ORGANIZATION moved around defensively at ORGANIZATION, but played third base exclusively during his pro debut. He has a solid arm, though needs to work on his accuracy, and he's a fringy defender. The ORGANIZATION believe he has a chance to stay there.ORGANIZATION has quickly become the top third baseman in the system and there's not much in front of him blocking his path. Assuming he plays solid enough defense, he could hit PERSON in a hurry.",1
"One of the areas of depth in GPE's system is its crop of interesting left-handed pitching. While PERSON doesn't top the list, he certainly has the potential to impact the big league staff, and in the not-too-distant future.Many thought PERSON might be destined for the bullpen one day, and while the Marlins haven't discounted the possibility entirely, they still are hoping the southpaw will develop as a rotation candidate.The key to that will be PERSON's breaking ball, to go along with his above-average fastball and solid changeup. His slider has improved, though it's not a finished project yet. PERSON knows he has to establish it as a consistently Major League-average offering to be a starter long term.",0
"A big lefty out of GPE Atlantic taken in the fourth round of the NUMBER Draft, PERSON absolutely dominated the ORGANIZATION during his first full season of pro ball, leading the ORGANIZATION organization in wins, ORGANIZATION and batting average against, while finishing second in strikeouts to top prospect PERSON Reyes.While PERSON's stuff doesn't jump off the page, he does have two above-average pitches at his disposal. His NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball plays up because of its life. He gets many swings and misses off of his changeup, his best pitch, maintaining his arm speed very well while throwing it. The ORGANIZATION call his breaking ball a curve, but it's more of a NUMBER-NUMBER mph slurve, which can be an effective third pitch. PERSON throws all of his pitches for strikes, working both sides of the plate effectively and mixing his pitches well.PERSON's upside is somewhat limited to that of a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter, but he seems a safe bet to reach that ceiling. With his advanced pitchability, he could start moving through the system a bit more quickly.",0
"There might not have been another college arm who shot up ORGANIZATION boards more than this ORGANIZATION ace during the spring. His rise slowed a bit with some struggles, perhaps caused by fatigue, in April. But he still has the size, stuff and command to potentially be a frontline starter at the highest level. PERSON's fastball will touch NUMBER mph and is consistently at least above average with good sink. He throws a nasty slider, and his changeup projects to be a legitimate weapon as well.PERSON has above-average control and command and the ideal athletic frame scouts love to see in a pitcher. There's room for gaining strength, which gives him a high ceiling as well.",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON twice, in the NUMBERth round out of an ORGANIZATION high school in NUMBER and in the NUMBERth round as a redshirt junior from GPE Tech four years later. In between, he spent a season each at LOCATION and GPE (Ariz.) CC and had PERSON surgery. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER, he made his big league debut in September NUMBER and was sold to the Athletics a year later.PERSON somehow misses bats despite lacking a true plus pitch. He operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with a fastball that has some armside run, throws a downer curveball to left-handers and back-foots his slider against righties. He also mixes in a changeup that can be an average offering at ORGANIZATION's control and command never have been his strong suits. He did a better job of locating his pitches where he wanted in NUMBER, though his walk rate jumped back up in NUMBER. He's unusual as a situation lefty who's not easy prey for right-handed hitters.",1
"The wave of teenage talent currently at Hi-A drove PERSON to push PERSON straight to Double-A to start his first full season, and he's risen to the occasion, off to a pretty strong start, at least from bat-to-ball standpoint. A minimalistic swing enables him to make high rates of contact while the strength in PERSON's hands generates doubles power. It's not an exciting, athletic style of hitting but on an inoffensive, fundamentally sound defensive shortstop, it's a pretty interesting skillset. Barring a significant swing change, PERSON's offensive output will likely cap his ceiling in the NUMBER/NUMBER FV range, but for a third round pick who moves quickly, that's a great outcome.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE in NUMBER, GPE had a successful GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, getting named to the ORGANIZATION post-season All-Star team and helping his Phillies team reach the rookie league's championship. He went NUMBER-for-NUMBER in the postseason (.NUMBER), ending the summer on a high note and leaving everyone excited for what might come. When GPE first joined the organization, he did so as a shortstop, splitting time between there and second during his NUMBER professional debut in the ORGANIZATION. In NUMBER, GPE played the right side of the infield exclusively and has the chance to be an outstanding defensive second baseman. GPE has shown a maturity at the plate that belies his years. He works counts and draws walks, having done more of that than striking out in his two summers combined. He makes consistent hard contact and can spray line drives to all fields from the left side of the plate. He has some extra-base pop and could develop a little more power as he matures. He has average speed, one of the reasons his range might be lacking for shortstop, and he isn't a base-stealing threat. It was an encouraging first summer in the GPE for GPE. His advanced approach should help him as he moves up the ladder, and he has the chance to develop into a big league second baseman with outstanding contact and on-base skills.",0
"PERSON displayed an interesting array of tools when he won the NUMBER/NUMBER-year-old division of the GPE, PERSON & Run competition at the NUMBER All-Star Game in GPE, and he's continuing to do so since turning pro as a third-round pick in NUMBER. In his first full pro season, he led the Minors with NUMBER runs while ranking fourth with NUMBER steals and fifth with NUMBER triples. In his second, he became the fifth PERSON shortstop to reach this big leagues this millennium, following PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON's well above-average speed is his standout tool and he employs it well. After hitting too many routine fly-balls in college, he has adjusted his approach to put more balls on the ground and use his feet to get on base, where he had NUMBER steals in NUMBER attempts during his first two seasons. He has a quick right-handed swing and barrels the ball consistently, and while he doesn't offer much power, he does show good patience at the plate.After spending his pro debut at shortstop, PERSON split time between second base and short in NUMBER. While his actions, range, hands and internal clock work at both spots, his average arm is a better fit at second. He shows ORGANIZATION upside at second base as he continues to learn the position.",1
"When No. NUMBER overall pick PERSON didn't sign in NUMBER, second-rounder PERSON became the top choice the ORGANIZATION landed in that Draft. He signed for a below-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER when a post-Draft physical raised concerns about his elbow that proved legitimate when he required PERSON surgery following his brief pro debut. After missing all of NUMBER, he returned in NUMBER to show the stuff that got him drafted so high, only to have his season end in mid-August with a NUMBER-game suspension when he tested positive for amphetamines.Before he got hurt, PERSON flashed the potential to have four solid or better pitches. He has regained his pre-surgery fastball, working at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touching NUMBER, with sink. His slider is his best secondary pitch, and he also throws a knuckle-curve and a changeup.PERSON throws strikes but will need to refine his command to succeed against more advanced hitters. His athleticism should help in that regard, and he's still young, so time is on his side.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their fifth-round PERSON pick in NUMBER, singing him with an above-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus, and he had outstanding pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON. He made the jump to full-season ball in NUMBER but got off to a painfully slow start, leading to a demotion to Class A Short PERSON in mid-May. PERSON thrived in the more age-appropriate LOCATION, pacing the league in doubles (NUMBER) and slugging (.NUMBER) and ranking second with NUMBER steals. In January, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION as part of the ORGANIZATION McGee-Corey Dickerson trade.PERSON has the chance to be an everyday third baseman when all is said and done. The right-handed hitter drives the ball with authority to all fields, showing the potential to hit for average, though his raw power plays only to his pull side at the moment. He has an advanced approach and good plate discipline for his age, a notion supported by the high on-base percentages and walk rates he's posted early in his career. On top of that, PERSON's average speed and surprisingly quick feet give him value as a baserunner, and he knows how to read pitchers and picks his spots to run wisely.Defensively, PERSON makes all the plays at the hot corner, with a very strong throwing arm highlighting his defensive skill set. He'll need considerable time to develop in the Minors, but PERSON shows the makings of becoming an everyday third baseman who provides NUMBER-plus homers and average defense annually.",0
"Standing NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and weighing NUMBER pounds, PERSON is an athletic shortstop with a solid skill set and an above-average run tool. He's a switch-hitter without much power, and there is a belief that he is a better hitter from the right side of the plate. That said, PERSON has made improvements from the left side and has made a name for himself as a contact hitter.On defense, PERSON has quick feet and good balance, and he is versatile enough to play multiple positions in the infield, but there is a belief he will stay at shortstop until he is forced to move elsewhere. Scouts have praised his bat control, but he is not known as a dynamic offensive player.PERSON is based in GPE, GPE, and is trained by PERSON. PERSON is considered the favorite to sign the ORGANIZATION teenager.",0
"No player from ORGANIZATION II Northeastern State in GPE has ever made it to the big leagues. PERSON, taken in the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft, is poised to be the first after a second full season that saw him pitch across three levels of the ORGANIZATION' system, though shoulder fatigued slowed his progress in NUMBER. Even though he's a bit undersized, PERSON has proven to be strong and durable, a right-hander who is all about power. He relies largely on his fastball-curve combination, recording high spin rates. He'll touch as high as NUMBER mph with his fastball, sitting comfortably around NUMBER-NUMBER mph. The curve is a true power breaking ball, one that misses bats. He's added a cutter recently that's a usable weapon and he does show some feel for his changeup. There has been concern about PERSON's command, but he stays around the strike zone and gets high marks for his attention to things like fielding his position and holding runners.Because of his size, arm strength and command, some have thought PERSON was destined to land in a bullpen. He'll continue to start for now, with the ORGANIZATION knowing that his fastball-curve combination would play up nicely in shorter stints as needed.",0
"PERSON was one of the youngest players in the NUMBER Draft class and perhaps its best athlete. He was certainly its fastest member and some scouts even believe his speed is comparable to fellow ORGANIZATION native PERSON Hamilton.But for all his physical tools, PERSON remains very raw and is a high-risk, high-reward player. He struggled in his first two full Minor League seasons, and his .NUMBER OPS in NUMBER was the fourth-worst among qualified players in the ORGANIZATION League.If PERSON can make some necessary adjustments at the plate, his power-speed combination has the potential to make him a truly dynamic player. He still has time on his side to figure it out, as he won't turn NUMBER until the second half of the season, but the clock is ticking.",0
"GPE has feel to hit from both sides of the plate and a non-zero chance to stick in center field, though he isn't as sure a bet to stay there as the some of the true burners ahead of him on this list.",0
"PERSON had a bit of a breakthrough in NUMBER, teaching himself a splitter that flashes plus in the second half when he wasn't happy with how his breaking ball was coming out of his hand. One pro scout we spoke with saw PERSON once early, when he was into the upper-NUMBER's with a plus-flashing breaking ball, then saw him later with the same heater and the plus-flashing splitter, only this time, he wasn't throwing the breaking ball much. That scout said if all three elements were together at once, it would be something like PERSON (who was a NUMBER or NUMBER PV/FV at his peak). There's some obvious risk that PERSON's stuff plays below it's peak NUMBER showings, that his command is a bit below average, and that his size limits him to multi-inning relief, in which case he's more of a NUMBER or NUMBER FV reliever who dazzles at times. He probably isn't a NUMBER inning starter, but PERSON will be one to watch early in NUMBER to see what sort of stuff he's showing. He could be the next Phillies Latin power arm to be moved to relief who then shoots to the big leagues after PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. We like the makeup and ability to make adjustments, so expect his grade to be higher in NUMBER if he continues doing what he did in NUMBER.",0
"At the NUMBER trade deadline, the ORGANIZATION acquired two left-handers who could be part of their future. PERSON made the better first impression, though PERSON made his big league debut that September after coming from the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON in a deal for PERSON Peavy.If PERSON's stuff and performance hadn't slipped a bit last year, PERSON might have parted with him. He usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with the ability to alter the velocity and movement of his fastball. His slider and changeup show signs of becoming solid secondary offerings but weren't as reliable in NUMBER as they had been in the past.PERSON throws strikes with all three of his pitches and mixes them well. He could help GPE as either a durable starter or as a lefty reliever, depending on the team's need.",1
"The PERSON made PERSON their eighth-round pick in June NUMBER, and then gave him $NUMBER,NUMBER to forgo his commitment to PERSON A&M. His dominance as an amateur carried over to his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, and PERSON built on that performance during his NUMBER full-season debut. The ORGANIZATION acquired the right-hander for PERSON on June NUMBER -- while in the midst of a stretch that saw him toss three straight hitless outings of five innings --- only to have to shut him down with a forearm strain that required PERSON surgery in GPE and cost him all of NUMBER. When healthy, PERSON has an impressive combination of stuff and feel. An uptick in velocity in NUMBER pushed his fastball into the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range in his pro debut, and he's adept at locating it to both sides of the plate. PERSON's changeup is a double-plus pitch and easily his best secondary offering, thrown with convincing arm action and outstanding tumble. He made strides with his breaking ball before undergoing surgery, throwing it with greater depth and sharper bite, giving him a promising arsenal of three average-or-better pitches. The right-hander uses his height to create good plane toward the plate, and it's only going to improve as he adds strength and gains better control of his core.PERSON returned to the mound late last season during fall instruction league and began his NUMBER season in late April in the GPE, where he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA with NUMBER strikeouts and four walks over NUMBER starts to earn a promotion to Double-A. He will need to refine his command and continue to improve his breaking ball, not to mention address ongoing concerns about his durability, but PERSON has the necessary ingredients to develop into a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter if it all comes together.",1

He finished his junior season at ORGANIZATION on a tear, then hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER after signing for a slightly over-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER.PERSON makes consistent contact, lacing line drives to all fields. His power mostly goes to the gaps at this point, but he has the potential to hit NUMBER homers per season if he adds some loft to his swing and turns on more pitches.

PERSON shifted him to second base in NUMBER, and he has enough athleticism and arm strength to become at least an average defender there.",0
"PERSON projected to go in the middle of the first round of the NUMBER Draft, yet the FACILITY Sox were able to get him with the NUMBERth overall choice in the second round. If his pro debut (which included a NUMBER/NUMBER K/BB ratio) is any indication, he could be a bigger steal than PERSON was with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick.PERSON has a promising four-pitch repertoire that starts with a low-NUMBERs fastball that tops out at NUMBER mph with good sink. His hard slider gives him a potential second plus pitch, while his curveball and changeup show the makings of becoming solid offerings. Add in his control and makeup, and PERSON has a high floor to go with his lofty ceiling. One of the most athletic and projectable pitchers available in the NUMBER Draft, he's a former three-sport star who easily repeats a loose, effortless delivery.",0
"Reid-Foley has been a similar pitcher from his junior year of high school all the way to his fifth year of pro ball in NUMBER. His arm action and delivery are a little stiff, and his command isn't quite enough to be a traditional starter, but he's stayed healthy and flashes two plus pitches with knowledge of the right way to sequence them, if not always execute them flawlessly. The ORGANIZATION will continue to run him out there as a starter -- he made NUMBER starts and threw NUMBER innings last season across three levels -- but most agree this is more of a multi-inning or high-leverage reliever, as opposed to a traditional starter. The pure stuff would fit any role on a staff, but the quality of the strikes (his command) is the issue, rather than the amount of strikes (his control), which was evident from his NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his major league debut in NUMBER.",0

PERSON has a good approach at the plate and the potential to be a solid all-around hitter.PERSON's defense remains a question mark, though he has gotten better behind the plate. He still needs to work on his receiving and blocking balls. PERSON's strong throwing arm remains an asset behind the plate. His bat would make him a valuable Major ORGANIZATION, even if he had to change positions, but he has star potential as a catcher.",1
"A two-way player at ORGANIZATION, PERSON had more success as an outfielder than as a pitcher before having PERSON surgery that cost him his entire NUMBER junior season. The ORGANIZATION still took him in the NUMBERth round that June, signing him for an above-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER. They didn't have him make his pro debut until May NUMBER and didn't fully turn him loose until this season, when he has been one of the top breakout performers in the system.Extremely athletic and possessing a quick arm, PERSON usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with late finish on his fastball. Though he's relatively inexperienced on the mound, he actually shows more present feel for his changeup than for his breaking ball. He'll flash some solid curveballs and also is working on a cutter.PERSON still has a lot to learn on the mound, which is understandable. He doesn't always attack hitters as much as he should, and his ability to locate his pitches will determine whether he winds up as a starter or reliever.

The eighth ORGANIZATION pitcher taken in the first round in the past NUMBER PERSONs, PERSON pitched sparingly during his pro debut following a long college season, though he competed well in a brief taste of the Class A Advanced PERSON League.PERSON has four pitches, all of which will flash at least better than average, with the ability to throw all of them for strikes. He throws his plus fastball in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range and can comfortably sit around NUMBER-NUMBER mph, maintaining his velocity deep into starts. He has two distinct breaking balls, with his hard curve a plus pitch that is just a touch ahead of a power slider. His changeup might be a touch behind the other three, but it's a usable weapon and he will throw it at times with above-average deception and movement. While PERSON struggled a little with command during his junior year, he is physical and athletic enough to repeat his delivery and throw more than enough strikes. His combination of size, stuff and projectability point to a future frontline starter, one who should move up the ORGANIZATION ladder quickly.",1
"PERSON set a Rice record with NUMBER saves as sophomore, eclipsing future big leaguers PERSON and PERSON, then moved into the ORGANIZATION' rotation early last spring. He missed time with elbow inflammation yet showed enough to get drafted in the third round and earn a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus. He was fully healthy after signing and made a scoreless four-inning cameo at the end of his pro debut.PERSON maintained his stuff while moving from reliever to starter, beginning with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball with armside run and downhill plane. He throws a spike curveball that can reach NUMBER mph and confound hitters, though it can be tough to command and PERSON curtailed his use of it last summer. He also has a fading changeup.He fills the strike zone and works with an efficient delivery, giving PERSON a good chance to remain a starter. He's not very physical, so he'll have to prove he's durable enough. If not, he could be a dynamic late-inning reliever.",0
"PERSON grew up in the ORGANIZATION area and didn't go far for college, heading to PERSON, where he was the ORGANIZATION' starting shortstop for over two years. A solid junior season led to his selection by the ORGANIZATION in the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft, and PERSON had a solid, albeit unspectacular, pro debut in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League.Tall and lanky, PERSON does have some offensive upside. While he can get pull-happy at times, and his approach suffered as he got fatigued late in his pro debut, he does have the chance to be a solid average hitter if he can use the entire field consistently. There might be more power to come if he can refine his approach as well. While PERSON has a strong arm and good hands, his fringy speed and limited range might mean an eventual move off of shortstop. He could handle third base capably enough defensively, but there will be more pressure on his bat to profile from a corner spot.For now, PERSON will continue to play shortstop as the ORGANIZATION get to see how it looks for a full season. If the power does come, he might profile at third. At worst, he could be a very valuable utility type with some feel to hit.",0
"GSP's offensive potential warranted a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus when he signed out of GPE in NUMBER, but it wasn't always evident when he went through the entire NUMBER season without an extra-base hit in NUMBER games. He exploded last year, earning ORGANIZATION honors in the ORGANIZATION after leading the ORGANIZATION league in hitting (.NUMBER), doubles (NUMBER) and ORGANIZATION (NUMBER) while also homering six times in NUMBER games.While the ORGANIZATION is a hitter's haven, GSP shows a patient approach and makes repeated hard contact. He drives the ball to both gaps and has some home run power to his pull side. As a left-handed hitter who could bat .NUMBER with NUMBER-NUMBER homers per year, he has more offensive upside than the typical catcher.A shortstop when the ORGANIZATION first worked him out, GSP still is learning the nuances of catching. Though he led the ORGANIZATION backstops with NUMBER errors, he has solid arm strength and the hands to become an average receiver. He'll have to watch his weight -- it's more than his listed NUMBER pounds -- to retain his agility behind the plate and avoid becoming a true baseclogger.",1
"More of a first baseman in high school, PERSON became a full-time pitcher at GPE (GPE) JC but couldn't find the strike zone as a freshman in NUMBER. He improved enough as a sophomore for the ORGANIZATION to draft him in the NUMBERth round, but he turned them down to transfer to ORGANIZATION and blossomed into a third-rounder in NUMBER. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER, he recorded a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and a NUMBER/NUMBER K/BB ratio in a spectacular pro debut, then reached Double-A in mid-May of his first full season.PERSON gets a remarkable amount of swings and misses on fastballs in the strike zone. He works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and peaks at NUMBER with running action that's as notable as his velocity. His creates deception with his crossfire and uphill delivery and locates his heater to both sides of the plate.After scrapping a curveball, PERSON has found more success with a slider/cutter that has a promising spin rate but lacks consistency. He's still working to refine his changeup after primarily relying on his fastball as an amateur. Some scouts question whether his delivery and arm action are conducive to starting every fifth day as a pro, though the ORGANIZATION have no such qualms.",0
"PERSON starred for the GPE national NUMBER-and-under team as a rising sophomore in August NUMBER, dominating GPE to win the gold-medal game at the ORGANIZATION championships. He already threw in the low NUMBERs and looked like a potential first-round pick for NUMBER, but he injured his elbow and had PERSON surgery as a junior and then pitched just one inning this spring. The ORGANIZATION made him its first pick on the third day of the GPE, taking him NUMBERth overall and then giving him $NUMBER.NUMBER million, more $NUMBER million above pick value, to lure him away from a GPE commitment. PERSON did hold bullpen workouts for scouts before the GPE, during which he looked as athletic and projectable as ever. He generates easy velocity, reaching NUMBER mph with some arm-side run and the promise of added heat once he fills out his lanky NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. He'll need time to develop his secondary pitches but shows the potential for at least a solid curveball and an average changeup.PERSON's athleticism should allow him to throw strikes and his arm works well, giving hope that he'll stay healthy going forward. It's that combination of feel and projection that has the ORGANIZATION excited about his future.",0
"After graduating high school, ORGANIZATION played basketball at ORGANIZATION II PERSON for a season, then transferred to GPE, where he re-introduced himself to baseball. He began throwing harder than he did as a prep prospect. The ORGANIZATION picked him late in the NUMBER draft and ORGANIZATION's velocity has continued to climb as he has moved fairly quickly through the system, reaching Double-A and the ORGANIZATION in his second full season. He now sits NUMBER-NUMBER and has touched NUMBER. He can alter the shape of his fastball to either ride or sink, and he will flash an above-average slider on occasion. He also has a well-below average changeup. With this size and small school, multi-sport athletic background, it's possible ORGANIZATION has some remaining development despite his age. He projects as a middle relief option.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the third round of the NUMBER Draft out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks. The projectable left-hander opened his first full pro season in the Rookie-level GPE, and he was pitching well there when the ORGANIZATION acquired him at the ORGANIZATION in the PERSON deal. In NUMBER, PERSON was having an uneven pro debut at ORGANIZATION A PERSON when he landed on the disabled list in June with an oblique strain. At NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER pounds, PERSON' frame offers a lot to dream on. So does his four-pitch mix. He can hit NUMBER mph with his fastball but usually sits around NUMBER-NUMBER, using his height to create a steep downhill plane. His low-NUMBERs curveball is his best secondary offering, and he also throws a slurvy slider in the low NUMBERs. PERSON made progress developing a changeup last season, though it lags behind his other offerings. He can throw strikes with his entire arsenal and is naturally tough to barrel.The ORGANIZATION expect PERSON to return to the mound in the near future and hope that he can make up for some of the time he lost while injured. He may be raw, but PERSON has the tools to become a back-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"Then with PERSON, GPE got red hot during the early part of NUMBER and looked like he might be turning a corner. PERSON saw him as multi-positional infielder with good feel for contact, but were forced to revisit that evaluation when GPE had a long stretch during which he was also hitting for power. He was promoted, his performance regressed, and he was traded to PERSON for PERSON just before the NUMBER season. Then, the upper levels of the minors took advantage of GPE' epicurean pitch selection, as his numbers continued to decline in NUMBER and NUMBER, forcing a move to the mound late in the summer. He has been into the mid-NUMBERs.",0
"One of the top athletes in the NUMBER international class, PERSON has made a quick ascent through the Minors since signing with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER. He opened eyes during his full-season debut in NUMBER and then reached Double-A as a NUMBER-year-old the following year, only to be traded to the ORGANIZATION during the offseason as part of a prospect package used to land PERSON. After a strong first half with Triple-A El Paso, PERSON suited up for the World team in the NUMBER ORGANIZATION Game at ORGANIZATION. PERSON is an all-around talent, possessing a high-end blend of athleticism, physical tools and baseball savvy. His quick bat and outstanding hand-eye coordination help him generate hard contact to all fields from the right side of the plate, and his advanced feel for controlling the strike zone suggests he'll continue to hit for a high average as he progresses. He's a bit undersized but has good strength to his frame and should offer at least fringe-average power at maturity. Though PERSON employs an aggressive approach and doesn't strike out much, he'll need to become more selective and draw more walks.PERSON's plus speed makes him a constant threat on the bases and should allow him to swipe at least NUMBER bags annually. It also enables him to cover a ton of ground in center field, and he shouldn't have trouble remaining at the position. PERSON has shown more polish and advanced quicker than expected, putting him on track to reach PERSON at age NUMBER.",1
"A power-filled performance for the GPE Junior National Team in NUMBER gave PERSON some late Draft helium, and he became the highest-drafted GPE hitter when the PERSON picked him NUMBERth overall that June. While he impressed in his full-season debut the following year, PERSON suspended PERSON in June after he was the perpetrator of a knife ""prank gone wrong"" that resulted in teammate PERSON needing thumb surgery and a lengthy stint on the disabled list. In GPE, the PERSON dealt PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in a deal for PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. After earning a second PERSON selection in NUMBER, PERSON reached Double-A for the first time at age NUMBER, and then performed well in his return to the level 'NUMBER.  Though known best for his robust left-handed raw power, PERSON has stood out more for his hitting ability early in his career. The ORGANIZATION native makes hard contact to all fields thanks to his plus bat speed and excellent hand-eye coordination, all while keeping his barrel in the zone for an extended period of time. PERSON tightened his approach in NUMBER and as a result had both his strikeout and walk rates move in positive directions. However, it's that same approach that can make PERSON too passive at the plate and fuel the pitch-selection issues that prevent him from getting to his power as often as he should during games. PERSON is short and stocky but also a good athlete for his size, with surprising, albeit below-average, speed. He's made strides with his defense at first base but still profiles as a below-average defender there, and the ORGANIZATION have played him more in left field at Double-A this season as a result. Defensive concerns aside, PERSON will have to tap into his power to make his corner profile work at the highest level.",1
"The ORGANIZATION may have gotten a steal by taking PERSON, the ORGANIZATION II Pitcher of the Year in NUMBER out of ORGANIZATION in GPE, in the fifth round of that June's Draft.With his relatively short and stocky build, along with his power stuff, PERSON may be best suited to a bullpen role, but the ORGANIZATION think he has the chance to start. It begins with a fastball that sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, with the right-hander being able to reach back for more, touching as high as NUMBER mph. His hard slider gives him a second potential swing-and-miss pitch. His changeup is effective at times, with some splitter-like action, but it's inconsistent. PERSON and physical, PERSON does have some effort in his delivery, and his command needs improvement -- more reasons why some see a future in the bullpen.A move to the pen could speed PERSON's progress to the big leagues, but the ORGANIZATION will let him start for the time being to see just what they have.",1
"The younger brother of GPE second baseman PERSON, PERSON is beginning to make a name for himself in the ORGANIZATION organization. As a NUMBER-year-old, the NUMBER fourth-rounder was a ORGANIZATION All-Star in his first full professional season. PERSON has shown he has a knack for making hard contact. He has a compact swing, a good feel for the barrel and an advanced approach at the plate. He's more of a contact hitter, but his solid build does help him create some power, especially when he can turn on the ball.PERSON has worked hard to improve defensively since being drafted, especially with his throwing. He's a capable defender and earns praise for his makeup and instincts. But it'll remain up to his offensive ability to get him to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION scouted PERSON at FACILITY A&M, they thought his stuff as a reliever could have placed him in the top two rounds of the NUMBER Draft. But he struggled in his junior year, so he was still on the board when the ORGANIZATION picked in the fifth round that June. His power stuff has played well in the lower levels of the Minors, and he was a ORGANIZATION State PERSON All-Star in NUMBER.With big stuff that projects well for the ORGANIZATION as a reliever, PERSON has two effective pitches with a plus-plus NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball and an above-average power curveball that ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER mph. There is no question he has swing-and-miss stuff, with a NUMBER.NUMBER K/NUMBER ratio entering NUMBER. He also gets a lot of weak contact on the ground, as evidenced by his NUMBER.NUMBER GO/AO ratio through the NUMBER season.PERSON still has work to do to sharpen his command and control after he had NUMBER.NUMBER walks-per-nine innings last season at ORGANIZATION while he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in NUMBER games. He doesn't need to have pinpoint control in short relief, but more consistent strikes could lead to him getting high-leverage innings late in games.",0
"It hasn't been the easiest road for PERSON, the one-time ORGANIZATION ace. It started with an elbow issue during his junior year of college, though he turned it around and had a huge Cape Cod League showing to get an over-slot deal as a sandwich round pick. He had a full, healthy season in NUMBER, reaching the Class A Advanced PERSON. That progress halted when he was limited to just seven starts in NUMBER as he battled a groin injury for much of the year, followed by shoulder fatigue that officially ended his season in July. Now healthy, the ORGANIZATION Sox are hopeful he's moving back in the right direction. When he's healthy, he still has the stuff to be dominant and his stuff appeared to be creeping back to where it should be when he was pitching in the GPE Winter League. While command of his above-average fastball was spotty, the consistency of his outstanding curve was back to his pre-injury college days. Add in a good feel for a changeup and there's still a lot to like.",0
"A two-way player who had started in ORGANIZATION's weekend rotation as a sophomore, PERSON served as the ORGANIZATION' closer this past season during their march to the ORGANIZATION World Series. The ORGANIZATION, in taking him No. NUMBER overall in the NUMBER Draft, think he might have the chance to head back into a rotation.As a starter, both at ORGANIZATION and in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON would throw his fastball in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, occasionally touching NUMBER. In short relief, he's been up to NUMBER-NUMBER and has been touching NUMBER mph. PERSON's mid-NUMBERs slider has tilt and bite when it's good, but it can get slurvy at times. He doesn't use his changeup much, and it's the development of that third pitch, along with refined fastball command, that will determine if the athletic PERSON can start at the next level.Cincinnati has had some success turning former college relievers into starters and getting them to the big leagues, so this process is worth watching.",0
"Known as a glove-first shortstop coming out of the GPE high school ranks in the NUMBER Draft, the ORGANIZATION started PERSON off slowly, first in the ORGANIZATION and then up to the GPE. After swinging the bat better than expected there, they jumped him to full-season ball in NUMBER, which may have been too aggressive of a move. PERSON didn't fare any better this year in his second crack at the LOCATION, prompting the ORGANIZATION to deal him to GPE in July in exchange for international signing bonus slots. Playing in over NUMBER games for the first time can be an arduous task, and PERSON did struggle with focus, leading to an inconsistent approach. He does have the tools to hit -- he raised his walk rate from his time in the ORGANIZATION and doesn't strike out a ton -- and he can even drive the ball on occasion, though power is not going to be a part of his game. But he had difficulty finding a consistent swing path, hampering his production. PERSON has the speed to steal a base, and that should be a bigger part of his game. He definitely has the tools to stay at shortstop, with good hands and instincts and a solid arm.PERSON showed a renewed focus during instructional league play last fall, and played well as a result. Though he's struggled to build on that momentum in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION are hopeful PERSON' game will flourish following a change of scenery.",0
"PERSON was a big name out of high school, reportefly turning down seven figures to go to PERSON knowing he would be an eligible sophomore due to his age. He's had an up-and-down spring, coming out of the chute blazing hot, leading to top-NUMBER pick momentum for the first month of the season, then slowly regressing in performance, fastball command and changeup usage. Most scouts think PERSON needs a delivery adjustment in pro ball to make himself more online to the plate as a way to improve his fastball command. That would likely tease out a bit more performance from PERSON's above-average stuff, but he's been too reliant on his plus curveball. To that point, hitters late in the season would sit on the pitch, knowing he had trouble locating his fastball and he barely threw his changeup, including his disastrous outing at GPE where he allowed NUMBER runs. PERSON has interest as high as NUMBERth overall to GPE and a couple other spots in the teens, but his mixed second half of the season has his likely range more in the NUMBERs.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have a very deep pitching staff, making it tough for even quality arms to get regular innings. PERSON has been the case for Dunning, who has the stuff to start, but because he has more value for the team as a reliever, hasn't been a regular part of the rotation in NUMBER.Dunning has gotten some starts on GPE, but because of him being needed to relieve on weekends, it's been sporadic. But many scouts feel he has the stuff to be in a rotation at the next level. He has a plus fastball, up to NUMBER mph, sitting NUMBER-NUMBER mph and with outstanding movement. He has a very good feel for his changeup as well. His breaking ball is fringy, but shows glimpses of being an average offering. Dunning's arm is so quick that he sometimes struggles with keeping the ball down in the zone, an issue most feel is correctable.Dunning reminds some of another talented Gators arm who had trouble finding rotation innings in college: PERSON. Dunning has the chance to be similar, a relatively quick to the big leagues back-end starting pitcher.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION drafted GPE out of GPE, they were hoping he'd be that college power bat that could develop into an everyday player in the future. While there are vastly differing opinions about GPE, he appeared to be on that track after the NUMBER season, when he led the organization in hits, homers, ORGANIZATION and slugging percentage while finishing second in batting average. Added up, that gave GPE the Double-A LOCATION MVP Award. But he struggled at ORGANIZATION in NUMBER and was unable to break through to PERSON, despite the ORGANIZATION' revolving door at first base. His improved plate discipline has allowed him to find better pitches to drive, for both two-base hits and home runs. Some really feel he has a chance to hit at the highest level. He's a below-average runner but should be just fine defensively at first base.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON pitched to mixed results as a swingman during his first two season at ORGANIZATION and didn't fare much better as a junior in NUMBER after a move to bullpen. His raw stuff continued to improve throughout his college career, though, and the ORGANIZATION took notice, eventually selecting PERSON in the NUMBERth round. After trying to gain traction as a starter early in his pro career, PERSON moved to the bullpen in NUMBER and promptly took off in the new role, turning in a dominant first half with PERSON en route to his first ever Double-A promotion at age NUMBER in July. A big and physical right-hander, PERSON has proved to be a late-inning force with his power fastball-curveball combo. He reaches NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his heater and throws it with late life that makes it difficult to lift for hitters on both sides of the plate. PERSON's breaking ball is equally dynamic, thrown in the upper NUMBERs with sharp, downer action that helps him miss bats with ease.PERSON's ability to induce whiffs with both pitches makes his below-average control a lesser issue, but there is some concern over whether hitters will continue to chase his stuff outside of the zone at higher levels. But with even minor improvements on that front, PERSON could soon find himself in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON has long impressed scouts with his pure stuff, but his erratic command has held him back. He took a step forward in NUMBER, making the LOCATION All-Star Game for Class A GPE, but struggled with his command after a second-half promotion to Class A Advanced Jupiter. A return to the ORGANIZATION State League and a move to the bullpen in NUMBER produced better results, though his walk rate remains a concern.PERSON's best weapon is his fastball-slider combination. His fastball can reach up to NUMBER mph, though he more typically dials it back some to gain more control. His mid-NUMBERs slider can be a swing-and-miss offering thanks to its late, biting action. He seldom uses his changeup, which lags behind his other two pitches. While PERSON's fastball-slider combination and the low arm slot he throws from make him tough on hitters, he has averaged more than five walks per nine innings as a professional. He will need to throw strikes more consistently to advance to the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION.",0
"After he put it all together during a breakout NUMBER -- which included NUMBER homers and NUMBER stolen bases, not to mention a GPE League record NUMBER-game hitting streak -- PERSON initially struggled in NUMBER. A left thumb ligament injury suffered early during Spring Training games when he crashed into the wall trying to make a catch made it tough for him to get on track.Brimming with tools and athleticism, PERSON could play center field in the ORGANIZATION right now. With PERSON departed, there is no center fielder in the system who can get to a fly ball or line drive like PERSON can. And his cannon arm also enables him to be a good right fielder. Offensively, he has well above-average raw power, but he still lacks in pitch selection and discipline while being super-aggressive at the plate, keeping him from tapping into that power consistently. PERSON has been working with him and had PERSON move his hands down on the bat to create more leverage. He possesses great bat speed and can create good backspin on the ball.Now is the time for PERSON to put it all together, especially after seven years in the organization and being NUMBER years old. On any given day, a scout could give him NUMBER and NUMBER grades across the board. But he needs to improve his emotional control and be pushed at times to reach what still appears to be a high ceiling. As one scout said, ""He'll show the tools at NUMBER o'clock, but will it translate at NUMBER?""",0
"GPE regarded as the best defensive shortstop in the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON has move up the organization's depth chart for middle infielders. There are two reasons for that: PERSON traded prized prospects Willy GPE (to the ORGANIZATION in the PERSON deal) and PERSON (to the D-backs in order to get PERSON from the ORGANIZATION) in NUMBER, and PERSON had by far his best year at the plate.PERSON's glovework is still his calling card, as he's capable of making dazzling plays at shortstop. He has quick, soft hands to go with a strong arm and a fast release. Unlike some acrobatic defenders who try to do too much, he's reliable and not error-prone.Whether PERSON's .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER production last season was for real remains to be seen. He always has controlled the strike zone well, but he was a career .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER hitter entering NUMBER. He has added strength and no longer gets overpower by pitchers, so there's hope he can hit enough to become a big league regular.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, he was an unheralded NUMBER-year-old with a high-NUMBERs fastball. He's made significant improvements since then and became one of the club's breakout stars of NUMBER with a dominating performance at two levels of the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has gotten stronger as a professional, and his fastball now comfortably sits in the mid NUMBERs and touches NUMBER mph. His curveball has also made strides and is a swing-and-miss pitch at its best. His changeup shows promise, but he's still learning the pitch. He doesn't have great height for a right-hander, but the ORGANIZATION have helped him adjust his delivery to allow him to throw from a steeper downhill plane and create groundball outs.In addition to signing at an older age than most of his compatriots, PERSON missed almost all of the NUMBER season due to injury. As a result, he hasn't thrown many innings as a professional, but his breakout performance already has scouts excited about his potential.",1
"PERSON had established himself as perhaps the most advanced pitchability high school lefty in the GPE class last summer and teams were initially excited when he broke out of the gate getting his fastball up to NUMBER mph. The enthusiasm was tempered quickly when PERSON blew out his elbow and needed PERSON surgery. Never one to shy away from drafting PERSON recipients, the PERSON selected the PERSON in the third round and gave him $NUMBER.NUMBER million, more than twice pick value, to forgo his commitment to Miami.It's possible the physically mature NUMBER-foot-NUMBER southpaw was overthrowing, leading to the elbow injury. Over the summer, he was comfortably touching NUMBER mph and sitting in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. It played up thanks to its good sinking action and how well PERSON commands it. He can change speeds on his curveball well and has a very good feel for a changeup.The PERSON' success in developing PERSON and PERSON, whom they drafted in the first rounds in NUMBER and 'NUMBER, respectively, bodes well for PERSON's future. Though he'll be eased along as he continues to recover from GPE surgery, PERSON's all-around package gives him the potential to move up the ladder quickly once fully healthy.",0
"The consensus top prospect on the international amateur market last summer, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER.NUMBER million. One club official called him a NUMBER-year-old version of PERSON.Like PERSON, PERSON fits the right-field profile extremely well. His most impressive tool is his power potential, as he has plenty of bat speed and room to add strength to his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. PERSON is more advanced than most NUMBER-year-olds at the plate, showing a precocious feel for pitch recognition and strike-zone discipline.Though PERSON is an above-average runner now, and he may begin his pro career in center field, he figures to lose a step once he fills out. That likely would dictate a move to right field, where his strong arm will fit nicely.",0
"PERSON starred for GPE at the NUMBER-and-under World Championships in the fall of NUMBER, but he worried scouts when his stuff and delivery didn't look as a good when he pitched at the World Baseball Classic the next spring. The ORGANIZATION still signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER as part of their NUMBER international spending spree, and he successfully navigated both Class A levels in his first two years as a pro.PERSON is one of the most polished pitchers in GPE's system, but his stuff ticked down in NUMBER. Though he still does a good job of locating his fastball on both sides of the plate, it now operates in the high NUMBERs and never has featured much life. He has good feel for spinning a tight curveball and using a changeup, though the latter pitch is less consistent than it had been in the past.If PERSON can regain some velocity -- he sat around NUMBER mph and reached NUMBER in NUMBER -- and his changeup returns to form, he still could be a back-of-the-rotation starter. His command and competitiveness have allowed him to succeed with a fringy fastball, and he won't beat himself by giving up walks or home runs.",1
"Over the NUMBER and NUMBER seasons, PERSON hit a combined NUMBER home runs and stole NUMBER bases. That power-speed combination not enough for the ORGANIZATION to protect on their loaded NUMBER-man roster, but PERSON was not selected in last December's Rule NUMBER Draft. That made him available to be one of four young players PERSON sent to the ORGANIZATION in GPE's PERSON trade.PERSON is very capable of impacting the ball and making productive hard contact. His improved launch angle and swing plane have led to his increased power numbers of the last two years and point to future pop. He has been more power over hit, as he swings and misses quite a bit and his overall plate discipline regressed when he moved to Double-A in NUMBER, but he made some nice adjustments in his first season with the ORGANIZATION. He's also struggled against left-handed pitching for much of his career. PERSON has shown he can play all three outfield positions capably, though he does have a below-average arm.Given the left-right splits and issues with his approach, PERSON might best be suited for a fourth outfielder or platoon role at the highest level. If he can get back to working counts better, he could hit his way into a larger role, though his defense doesn't necessarily profile well enough in one spot to stick there.",1
"Much like fellow outfield prospect PERSON, PERSON has a veritable toolchest to work with. He, too, started to figure some things out in NUMBER, albeit in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION.PERSON was all over the ORGANIZATION leaderboard, as the NUMBER signee out of the ORGANIZATION started tapping into his considerable raw power consistently for the first time. Tall and lanky, PERSON still has room to get stronger and he started showing a better overall approach at the plate. More patience will allow him to get into better hitter's counts so he can use that extra-base pop to an even greater advantage. An above-average runner who can steal a base, PERSON has a very strong arm, making him a good fit as the prototypical athletic right fielder. He still has a long way to go, but the ORGANIZATION were encouraged by his progress and hope he builds on that as he moves up the ladder.",0
"| Overall:NUMBER/ NUMBER The former PERSON standout has an intruiging three-pitch mix coming from a perfect pitcherâs frame that allowed him to lead the organization in strikeouts in NUMBER. His changeup stands out as his most effective pitch, with excellent sink. Heâs picked up velocity on his fastball and will touch NUMBER mph. His slider should give him a Major League average breaking ball. He keeps everything down in the strike zone and everything moves. He earned a promotion during his first full season and after a strong stint in the ORGANIZATION, heâs ready to move on the fast track.",1
"PERSON had a productive college career at GPE and helped the ORGANIZATION to a runner-up finish at the NUMBER College World Series. PERSON viewed him as an advanced hitter, and the GPE agreed, sending him to low Class A Lake County for his professional debut after he signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as a supplemental first-rounder. At GPE, PERSON was one of the best hitters in college baseball. He showed excellent plate discipline and pitch recognition, hit line drives to all fields with a balance left-handed swing and displayed promising power potential. Outside of drawing walks, he hasn't looked like the same guy as a pro, striking out more than expected and often making weak contact when he puts the ball in play.PERSON primarily played first base as a junior, but the GPE returned him to the outfield, where he played earlier in his career. His arm and athleticism are both good enough to make him a capable corner outfielder.",0
"PERSON was under the scouting radar until a breakout campaign on Cape Cod, during which both he and teammate PERSON (a second round pick by the ORGANIZATION) emerged as top tier bats in the NUMBER draft. During the spring, PERSON steadily worked his way up from the late first round to the third overall pick by hitting more than scouts expected a long-limbed power threat to hit. PERSON pulls this off by keeping his arms tucked in during his swing and having a flatter plane; as a result he's both quicker into the zone and in the zone longer than most power hitters. Ideally, hitters with PERSON's plus-plus power have more loft in their swing plane and extend their arms to generate the most power, with PERSON an example of a hitter with a similar frame and this more power-focused approach. We're projecting PERSON as a NUMBER bat with NUMBER game power and split the difference a bit--he could go even more extreme for power at the expense of contact--but there are a number of ways this offensive skillset could turn out, particularly with new and more progressive hitting instruction this year for the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's defense also could go a few different ways, depending how much weight he adds to his lean frame and how his lateral quickness ages. Defensively, PERSON looks major league average at times and clearly below average at others, but he'll get plenty of chances to make things work at third base.",0
"After making the move from shortstop to center field in NUMBER, PERSON began to settle into his new position in NUMBER. His speed and athleticism play up in the outfield, and he has the tools to be a good defender as he gets more experience. His plus speed works on the basepaths as well, and he should be a threat to steal as he develops. PERSON is never going to be a part of his game, but if he can continue to improve his approach at the plate to get on base more and become an average hitter, he has the skills and makeup to become a solid leadoff hitter in the future.",0
"In the NUMBER international amateur class, PERSON got most of the attention regarding players from the ORGANIZATION. But the D-backs liked what they saw in fellow GPE shortstop PERSON, signing him for $NUMBER,NUMBER. A solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER had the organization excited for his full-season debut in NUMBER, but after shaking off a slow April with a hot start to May, GPE tore his right meniscus, ending his season.GPE's knee is fine and he was back in time to participate at the organization's instructs in the ORGANIZATION last fall. He has a ton of offensive potential to tap into, with the ability to impact the baseball consistently and plenty of raw power. He needs to keep refining his approach from the left side of the plate and it looked like he was making strides in that regard, raising his OPS by over NUMBER points over the NUMBER games in May last year before he got hurt. The D-backs are hopeful those improvements carry over to NUMBER and with a better approach, more over-the-fence power should follow.There is little question GPE can stay at shortstop, with good hands and actions to go along with enough arm for the premium position. As a kid from the ORGANIZATION who didn't face a ton of top-notch competition, GPE could take longer to learn the approach necessary to tap into his raw tools. The D-backs are hopeful a healthy NUMBER will help move him in the right direction.",0
"An excellent athlete, PERSON was considered the top two-way player in the NUMBER Draft class. In the end, however, scouts couldn't pass up his combination of size and stuff from the left side, and GPE selected him seventh overall as a pitcher.PERSON throws his fastball in the low NUMBERs, and there is projection left in his lanky frame. He only began throwing a curveball a couple years ago, but it already shows the potential to be an above-average pitch. In the absence of a breaking ball, PERSON's changeup blossomed, and it has the potential to develop into a plus offering.Despite his height, PERSON's athleticism gives him a chance to learn how to repeat his delivery well enough to have solid command. Though he is further away than most of the ORGANIZATION's top pitching prospects, PERSON's ceiling might be the highest of all of them.",0
"Some international evaluators had a longer history of seeing PERSON than area scouts did, as PERSON spent his freshman and draft-eligible sophomore seasons at two different schools, but he's been pitching for GPE's national team since NUMBER. A dual citizen, PERSON was the first ever GPE to have his name called during baseball's draft. His stuff drastically improved once he began to be nurtured by the ORGANIZATION' player development machine, and PERSON'd more hitters over NUMBER innings of work in NUMBER than he did during his entire college career. His fastball has middling velocity but it's lively, and PERSON's arm slot is tough on righties. Both of his secondaries are capable of missing bats and while PERSON lacks pinpoint command, he throws enough strikes to start. Before he was part of the ORGANIZATION trade, PERSON projected as a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter or multi-inning reliever. We think he's best suited for the latter role, but given the rebuilding nature of the GPE, he'll likely begin his big league career as a starter.",0
"PERSON passed on an opportunity to turn pro as the ORGANIZATION' NUMBERrd-round pick in NUMBER and instead honored his commitment to GPE, where he enjoyed a breakout campaign as a sophomore and then continued to star during the summer for the GPE collegiate national team. As a result, PERSON ranked as the ORGANIZATION's top position prospect entering NUMBER based on his combination of hitting and athletic ability, and he backed up that title by hitting NUMBER homers with NUMBER steals as a junior. The ORGANIZATION made him the fifth-overall pick in June, gave him $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER -- the largest bonus in club history -- and then an aggressive assignment to the ORGANIZATION State League for his pro debut.With a quick left-handed bat and a knack for making hard contact, PERSON projects to hit for both power and average from the left side of the plate. There's NUMBER-homer potential in his bat, perhaps even more if he can become more comfortable driving the ball the other way. PERSON did a better job of managing the strike zone last spring and then during his pro debut, but he still struggles at times to recognize spin, resulting in some swing-and-miss tendencies. PERSON's plus speed makes him a consistent threat on the basepaths and also serves him well in center field, where he spent his entire pro debut after manning right field exclusively at ORGANIZATION suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee during instructional league and underwent subsequent surgery in October, which delayed the start to his NUMBER campaign. Though he's struggled this season back in the ORGANIZATION State League, PERSON's combination of power and speed could help him to jump on the fast track to the big leagues once everything clicks.",0
"PERSON signed as an under-the-radar, NUMBER-year-old GPE defector in July of NUMBER. The NUMBER season was PERSON' first full year of baseball since the NUMBER-NUMBER PERSON because his defection, international signing rules, and the NUMBER offseason led to an eon between actual games for him. He was a college-aged player in the LOCATION in NUMBER and had a mandatorily strong statistical season, hitting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with PERSON. He continued a strong bat-to-ball showing during instructional league, looked good at several different defensive positions, and was then firmly on the pro scouting radar. He got some reps with the big league team during 'NUMBER spring training. For now, he looks like a possible infield utility piece with some contact skills, but it might behoove GPE to hit the gas on his development and promotion to see if there could be more here.",0
"After spending a second-round pick and $NUMBER,NUMBER to sign PERSON out of high school in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION deployed him mainly as a reliever for three seasons before trading him and fringe infield prospect PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in December NUMBER. PERSON shifted to the rotation with his new organization and reached Double-A at age NUMBER before PERSON surgery cost him most of NUMBER and a lat injury knocked him out for most of NUMBER. He bounced back to reach the big leagues in NUMBER, again back largely in a relief role. The ORGANIZATION sent him to the ORGANIZATION in December. A big-bodied right-hander in the mold of GPE, PERSON had a so-so fastball in the past but returned from surgery with more velocity, working at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touching NUMBER. He flashes a plus slider, but it's mostly an average pitch, while his curveball and changeup are effective at times. PERSON' NUMBER-pound frame doesn't lend itself to an athletic delivery, so the ORGANIZATION thought his stuff could play better in shorter stints, and they moved him to the bullpen in late May as a result. He did have success as a starter in the upper Minors, so it's not out of the question the ORGANIZATION will give him another shot at making the rotation.",0
"PERSON has always been blessed with tremendous raw tools, but has had trouble developing them, dealing both with injury and off-the-field issues. The NUMBER season may prove to be the year the ORGANIZATION look back on as the time when the outfielder really started to put things together. He still only played in NUMBER games as he was delayed coming back from shoulder surgery, but he performed well in the ORGANIZATION State League and then kept going with a strong ORGANIZATION showing. PERSON has all the tools in the box, starting with plus speed that works on both sides of the ball. He has a very quick bat and can drive the ball to all fields, with more than enough future power, though he needs to continue to work on his selectivity. He can flat out play the outfield with a well above-average arm. He plays with an all-out style that's infectious. It's all about health at this point. If he can stay on the field, he has the chance to be an impact player.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"Has been hurt a lot and is now NUMBER and still walking lots of batters, but heater has touched NUMBER this year and breaking stuff fits in a relief role.",0
"A reliever throughout his college career at GPE, PERSON saved NUMBER games in his two seasons as the ORGANIZATION closer. The diminutive right-hander throws his fastball in the low-NUMBERs, occasionally touching the mid-NUMBERs. His two-seamer has good movement and complements his slider well. He also has a changeup, though he seldom uses it. PERSON is strictly a reliever and has the mentality needed to pitch in high-leverage situations. The D-backs have used him as a closer in his first two stops as a professional. Whether he can remain in that role as he advances to the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION will depend on his ability to tighten his somewhat shaky command.",0
"The ORGANIZATION sent PERSON straight to full-season Augusta for his GPE debut in NUMBER and after stumbling out of the gate, the big lefty regained his footing and pitched very well down the stretch. PERSON will challenge hitters with a sinking fastball and he does a good job of keeping his three-quarters slider down in the strike zone as well. His sinking changeup gives him a third future average pitch and all of his stuff plays up because of his advanced feel for pitching and ability to throw strikes. It all comes from a clean and easy delivery that he has no problem repeating, which should help him on his way up the organizational ladder.",0
"GPE's velo was down a bit last year and at times his fastball sat in the mid-NUMBERs instead of the upper-NUMBERs and low-NUMBERs like it had the year before. He's on this list because he has one of the better changeups in the minors and throws a lot of strikes, but he'll need to exhibit a velocity bounce-back this year to remain here, or else show that he has traits that make his fastball playable despite the lackluster velo.",0
"The NUMBER season is PERSON's ninth since signing with the ORGANIZATION out of GPE way back in NUMBER. It's been a long road for the right-handed reliever, but he finally reached the upper levels of the system and made his big league debut at the beginning of June.PERSON took a big step forward, results-wise, in his first season in Double-A in NUMBER, with an improved ability to consistently find the strike zone. PERSON walked just NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings a year ago while also missing more bats -- he struck out one per inning -- than he had previously in his career, trends that generally carried over to NUMBER. Over the years, the NUMBER-foot-NUMBER reliever has increased his velocity and will now sit in the low NUMBERs and bump it up to around NUMBER mph at times. He's capable of throwing an effective slider along with it.The ability to command both pitches will be essential if he's to contribute to the big league bullpen, though he doesn't profile as a closer at the highest level.",1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON, PERSON and PERSON out of the NUMBER international signing class, with PERSON getting $NUMBER,NUMBER to sign out of GPE. He took a small step backwards with the move to full-season ball in NUMBER, and his season ended in late July because of a stress reaction in his wrist. Injuries plagued him again in NUMBER, as hamate bone surgery forced him out of action in June.Some of the regression is really a matter of comparison to his huge season in PERSON in NUMBER, where he hit .NUMBER and slugged close to .NUMBER. It's possible he may not be the offensive force some thought was emerging, but the ORGANIZATION still feel there's enough bat here for him to be a legitimate prospect. Excited by his extra-base output in the GPE, it's possible there won't be much power moving forward. There are no questions about his defense, however, with the hands, arm and range to stay at shortstop long-term, making him the best defensive shortstop in the system.Just NUMBER, PERSON is plenty young enough to shrug off these setbacks and rediscover his solid approach. How much his bat develops will ultimately determine what kind of player he'll be once he arrives in GPE.",1
"PERSON's arrival in pro ball took longer than expected. He declined to sign with the ORGANIZATION as a ninth-rounder out of high school, missed most of his first year at ORGANIZATION with a shoulder injury that required labrum surgery and turned down the ORGANIZATION as a second-rounder in NUMBER. He repeated as a second-rounder last June, signing for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as a redshirt junior.In his first summer as a pro, PERSON quickly became a favorite of ORGANIZATION officials for his ability to throw four pitches and locate them where he wants. He works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches NUMBER with his fastball, which plays up because of its armside run. His slider is often his best pitch and grades as plus at times, and he also can spin a curveball and fool hitters with his changeup.PERSON's stuff was a tick sharper in NUMBER, so he could have more in the tank. He finished his pro debut with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in five starts (including the playoffs) at ORGANIZATION A Advanced, and his feel for pitching should allow him to advance rapidly through the Minors.",0
"An effective three-year college starting pitcher at GPE taken in the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft, PERSON found his home in the ORGANIZATION system as a reliever and racked up NUMBER saves in his first three years. But in NUMBER at ORGANIZATION, he was employed mainly in a set-up role, pitching well enough to earn a spot on the NUMBER-man roster.PERSON has an often deceptive three-quarters delivery that enables him to hide the ball well. Able to throw up to NUMBER mph, he can also keep hitters guessing by changing arm angles and tempo or shortening his stride. Unless he develops his below-average and seldom-used changeup, he could have time managing left-handed hitters in the big leagues. He could temper that with by burying a backdoor slider in on lefties.While he certainly has the mentality to be a big-league closer with a delivery not unlike PERSON or PERSON, his stuff projects as a likely better fit as a middle reliever or right-handed matchup specialist. PERSON doesn't walk a lot of batters nor he is victimized much by the long ball, and he is capable of racking up strikeouts.",0
"Signed as a skinny infielder at age NUMBER in July NUMBER and immediately transitioned to the mound, PERSON has added size and strength to his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame over time. A big 'NUMBER that saw him go to the ORGANIZATION, lead the organization in strikeouts and get added to the NUMBER-man roster put him more firmly on the map. He reached Double-A in NUMBER, but wasn't nearly as dominant in the process.Stuff-wise, PERSON has more than enough to get big league hitters out. He has a lively fastball that he throws consistently up to the mid-NUMBERs that can miss bats and get weak contact on the ground. He'll show a plus curveball that can be a true out pitch and a changeup that might be above-average when all is said and done. The premium stuff can play down at times because of his below average command and control. He walked just over four per nine innings in NUMBER, in line with his career rate, though he really struggled to find the strike zone when he moved up to Double-A.PERSON has some effort to his delivery and can fly open at times, leading to those control problems. There's long been talk about him being a reliever in the future, where his outstanding stuff would play up and his durability could allow him to handle multiple innings.",1
"PERSON has had an up-and-down couple of years; he's dealt with serious health issues and death in his immediate family, and living far away from home, along with some relatively less important professional matters, has also proven to be burdensome. A series of off-the-field issues and maturity concerns led the ORGANIZATION to sell low on him in the trade that brought him to GPE. He has a frame along the lines of a Prince Fielder or a ORGANIZATION in that he looks unathletic when static, but you can see he's deceptively athletic for his size. PERSON has reportedly recently lost a lot of weight and gotten into the best shape of his life (alarm sound). He has high octane stuff with a plus fastball/slider combo and a changeup that's come to be average, along with better control and command than you might expect from a young power pitcher. PERSON is very close to losing eligibility, but he may be the rare case of a player who actually demonstrates in March that the changes he's made are real and moves up a list, since it's hard to upgrade a guy based on verbal reports that he's making progress in non-competitive environments.",0
"Most talented junior college prospects end up either signing or transferring to a Division I program after a single year, but PERSON is the rare two-year ORGANIZATION prospect who stuck around for multiple seasons and still saw his draft stock soar. He's a hulking NUMBER-foot-NUMBER with huge arm strength, but the rest of the profile has not progressed despite two and a half years of development as a starter. Even during starts, PERSON sits NUMBER-NUMBER and will touch NUMBER. Heavy use of that pitch alone could make him a fine middle reliever, even if his slider is only average. Scouts are hesitant to project on PERSON's secondaries because he's a below-average athlete, but we're curious about what the velo might do if he were just airing it out for an inning at a time.",0
"Five years after PERSON went No. NUMBER overall in the Draft out of PERSON, PERSON went No. NUMBER overall in the third round as another hard-throwing right-hander from the program. PERSON can light up a radar gun with the best of them, making him one of the numerous power arms the ORGANIZATION collected in the NUMBER Draft. He's reached triple digits in shorter relief stints and will sit in the mid NUMBERs, touching NUMBER-NUMBER mph as a starter. PERSON has a lot of moving parts in his delivery and still is learning to control his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame, so he lacks consistency with the rest of his pitches as well as his control and command. His low-NUMBERs slider has the most potential of his secondary offerings, and he also throws a curveball and a changeup. PERSON started and relieved during his college career, working as PERSON's closer during his junior year. The ORGANIZATION began developing him as a starter before moving him to the bullpen, with good results before a stint on the disabled list in early June. He has the stuff to thrive at the back end of a bullpen.",0
"PERSON went in the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft because he was an efficient, durable lefty starter, and he has been exactly that in his first two pro seasons. He led the high Class A GPE League with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his NUMBER pro debut and successfully made the jump to Double-A last year.PERSON keeps hitters off balance by mixing two types of fastballs, two types of breaking balls and a sinking changeup that grades as his lone plus pitch. His fastball usually ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER mph, with sink on his two-seamer and cutting action on his four-seamer. His curveball and slider are two distinct, average offerings.He has an easy delivery that he repeats consistently. His lack of overpowering stuff leaves him with little margin for error, but he doesn't make many mistakes.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of GPE in the fall of NUMBER, they saw a tall and projectable right-hander they hoped would evolve into big league starting material. It appeared like he was just starting to put it together when he was one of three pitching prospects sent to GPE as part of the huge PERSON trade. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER NUMBER-year-old has natural size and arm strength working in his favor. With a loose arm, he can run his fastball up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph. He throws it with a ton of sink, already showing a propensity for groundball outs. He complements his fastball with a slider that shows glimpses of being a quality breaking ball and also has a feel for a changeup. In small increments, PERSON has shown an ability to make adjustments, and he's become a little more efficient, in terms of finding the strike zone. PERSON back at the start of the NUMBER season in extended spring training, PERSON impressed the ORGANIZATION enough to earn a move to full-season Lansing in early May,",0
"Over the years, PERSON has been a veritable factory producing right-handers who really know how to pitch and compete without premium stuff. In NUMBER, PERSON went in the second round to the ORGANIZATION. Two years later, the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the third round. This year, it's PERSON's turn and he's hoping to join his predecessors in the top three rounds. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER right-hander has been a solid college performer, with a highlight being throwing PERSON's fifth no-hittter in history in late March. As a freshman, he was touching NUMBER mph with his fastball, but hasn't gotten back there since, typically sitting in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. Early this season, PERSON used a plus changeup with tremendous success and showed a below-average breaking ball. Over the course of the spring, his curve has bounced back and flashes above-average, but his changeup has regressed. He's a strike-thrower, but not quite with the precision PERSON or PERSON showed during their days anchoring the Titans rotation. PERSON missed a good chunk of his sophomore season with elbow inflammation and has not pitched over the summer in either of the past two years. He's shown no ill effects this year, though, and a team that believes he could have two above-average secondary offerings to go along with his feel for pitching could snag him early as a back-end starter type who could move quickly.",0
"Coming off a strong Cape Cod League season last summer, PERSON stepped up in a big way during his junior season at FACILITY, picking up the slack when teammate PERSON went down with an injury. PERSON known as a strong hitter, he added power to his game, helping the ORGANIZATION win the ORGANIZATION World Series after being selected No. NUMBER overall by the ORGANIZATION, who eventually signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million, $NUMBER,NUMBER below pick value.PERSON had long been known for his advanced approach from the left side of the plate. He's not afraid to draw walks and makes consistent hard contact, always loving using the opposite field. PERSON had thought there was power to tap into and he did that this spring, reaching double-digit home runs. With a tick above-average arm, there's a chance PERSON could play right, though a lack of speed makes most feel left field is his likely long-term defensive home.Wherever he lands in the outfield, it's PERSON's bat that got him drafted in the first round by the ORGANIZATION. With his plate discipline and ability to drive the ball, he is the type of college performer who could move pretty quickly through PERSON's system.",0
"In his first year and change in the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON pitched out of the bullpen. The next two seasons, he got a chance to start. In all instances, the lefty out of GPE has had success, despite an array of fringy stuff that says he shouldn't be knocking on the big league door.On paper, PERSON shouldn't be in the mix to contribute. His fastball sits in the upper-NUMBERs. His changeup and cutter are PERSON average and he has a fringy slider he mixes in effectively. He's a rare southpaw who has a knuckleball, but he doesn't throw it very often. What PERSON does do is command all of his pitches to both sides of the plate exceptionally well. He adds and subtracts, mixes his pitches well and works quickly, so fielders love playing behind him.Take NUMBER pitchers with PERSON's stuff and at least NUMBER of them don't even make the upper levels of a system. PERSON's competitiveness and smarts on the mound, however, have him bucking the odds, with a chance to be a lefty swingman or No. NUMBER starter in the future.",0
"PERSON anchored the ORGANIZATION of GPE's offense for four years, helping the Gators reach the ORGANIZATION World Series three consecutive times. He has continued to hit as a professional, impressing PERSON general manager PERSON, who said he hopes PERSON can develop into ""the ORGANIZATION"" of GPE's system.PERSON has flown a little under the radar despite his long track record. He has a good feel for hitting and he doesn't strike out much. PERSON's power is his best tool, and his NUMBER home runs in NUMBER ranked second among all PERSON Leaguers.PERSON has moved between first base and the outfield corners throughout his career. He has the ability to be a serviceable outfielder, but it will be up to his bat to carry him to the Major Leagues",0
"PERSON turned down the ORGANIZATION as a ninth-round pick out of high school in NUMBER, missed much of his first year at ORGANIZATION with a shoulder injury that led to labrum surgery and declined to sign with the ORGANIZATION as a second-rounder in NUMBER. He finally turned pro after his redshirt junior season, signing with the ORGANIZATION in June for $NUMBER.NUMBER million after going in the second round again.PERSON missed a couple of starts in NUMBER with an oblique strain, and when he came back, his stuff wasn't quite as sharp as it had been the year before. He spent much of the spring ranging from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball after touching NUMBER previously. His slider lost some power too but still ranked as his best pitch and a potential plus offering.A true four-pitch guy, PERSON can spin a curveball and deceive hitters with his changeup. He controls and commands his pitches well, giving him a reasonable chance to at least become a back-of-the-rotation option.",0
"It's amazing what some strength and conditioning can do. Initially a diminutive glove-only shortstop when he signed in NUMBER, PERSON has been through the organization's strength program twice. The result was a breakout NUMBER season that saw him make the LOCATION League All-Star Team and earn a promotion.There are some who feel PERSON is the best defensive shortstop in the system, high praise considering J.P. Crawford's presence. PERSON has all the tools to play the premium position at a high level, with a plus arm, glove and range. His NUMBER speed on the scouting scale allows him to have excellent range and makes him a basestealing threat. His offensive tools all play up now thanks to that added strength. He can drive the ball to the right-center-field gap with authority and his NUMBER extra-base hits show that he no longer will have the bat knocked out of his hands.PERSON still has a ways to go in terms of refining his approach and improving his offensive game. But he's headed in the right direction and now looks like he has the chance to be an everyday shortstop at the big league level.",0
"The ORGANIZATION got three members of their NUMBER Top NUMBER list when they decided to trade reliever PERSON to the ORGANIZATION last June. PERSON is the highest ranked of the trio, and the only one on the NUMBER-man roster. Signed a bit older than most international amateurs at age NUMBER, he entered the NUMBER season just about ready to knock on the big league door and he knocked it down with his first big league callup in late April.PERSON has always hit from the right side of the plate, showing a knack for making hard contact to all fields. What hasn't shown up consistently yet is his power, but the ORGANIZATION think there's more in there. Much of it has to do with his hitting philosophy. Because of his advanced bat-to-ball skills, PERSON would often catch the ball too deep in the zone and not get his bat head enough. There could be more over-the-fence power if he can find a better point of contact.An uptick in power would let him profile well at third because there is no question he can defend there. He's more agile than you'd think given his size and he could be a plus defender with a plus arm. His perceived ceiling might be higher were he NUMBER with his tools, but PERSON might just be a late bloomer who still turns into an every day player at the hot corner.",1
"After beginning his pro career is ho-hum fashion, PERSON had a breakout NUMBER season and a solid follow-up in NUMBER. He has bat speed and some leverage, showing good raw power, though it didn't show up in games in NUMBER like it did the year prior. That was partially because of a broken hamate bone suffered at the beginning of the year, but he showed better hittability upon his return, cutting down his strikeouts and getting on base at a better clip. A solid average runner, he plays a decent center field, but he's seen time in all three spots and probably will settle into a left field job in the future. With the power-speed output of NUMBER, followed up by the higher average NUMBER season, it's a little tougher to figure out what PERSON will be, but he should hit himself to the big leagues soon.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON began his college career at FACILITY A&M before transferring to GPE, where he paced the LOCATION Conference in average (.NUMBER), home runs (NUMBER) and stolen bases (NUMBER) en route to ORGANIZATION player of the year honors in his second year with the Aggies. Intrigued by his combination of tools and performance, the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON $NUMBER,NUMBER after selecting him in the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft. PERSON fits the bill of a raw-but-toolsy college player, standing out for his top-of-the-scale speed and arm strength, with the defensive chops to remain in center field long term. He's less advanced at the plate, however, although he does show some feel for finding the barrel and has enough raw power to project for double-digit home runs once fully developed.Though his tools are impressive, PERSON will need time to refine his overall baseball skills on both sides of the ball. If it all comes together, he could develop into an up-the-middle asset capable of impacting games in several ways.",0
"Lightly recruited out of high school, GPE has established himself as one of the most reliable power hitters in college baseball. He homered six times in seven games in March and has reached double figures in two of his three seasons at ORGANIZATION. Facing top competition in the ORGANIZATION last summer, he tied for second with six longballs.GPE has good strength and excels at generating backspin on his drives from the right side of the plate. He can get pull-conscious at times but generally stays under control at the plate and manages the strike zone reasonably well, so he should hit for a decent average.GPE has enough arm strength for third base but almost certainly will move to a different position in pro ball. His throws lack accuracy at times and his hands and quickness are subpar for the hot corner. First base is his likely destination.",0
"PERSON opened his senior season at GPE (Okla.) High in NUMBER with consecutive no-hitters then blew out his elbow in his third start and required PERSON surgery. He spent NUMBER rehabilitating his elbow and turned down the Indians as a NUMBERth-round pick before enrolling at GPE. A rare Draft-eligible freshman, he led the LOCATION with NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER innings before going to the ORGANIZATION in the third round of the NUMBER Draft. PERSON's development accelerated in NUMBER, and the right-hander finished the year with a strong performance at ORGANIZATION, striking out NUMBER batters and allowing one hit in his final regular-season start, then firing another six-inning, one-hit gem in the LOCATION playoffs. He struggled to build on that progress in NUMBER, as a combination of control problems and diminished stuff led to a demotion from PERSON back to Class A Advanced GPE, and he ultimately landed on the injured list with tightness in the back of his shoulder in June. PERSON's power stuff is headlined by a plus fastball-curveball combo. His heater currently sits in the mid-NUMBERs with riding life, and there's a chance he adds even more velocity as he continues to distance himself from the surgery. His curveball, meanwhile, is a NUMBER-to-NUMBER hammer that he throws with power in the mid- to upper-NUMBERs. Together, the two pitches give PERSON the ability to induce ugly swings-and-misses, which he did at a near NUMBER percent clip in NUMBER, while averaging NUMBER.NUMBER strikeouts-per-nine. PERSON's split-changeup gives him a third above-average-or-better pitch, one that at times can be almost as effective as his curveball. While PERSON's dynamic arsenal and room for improvement give him a chance to remain a starter, most scouts project him as a reliever long-term because he doesn't have an athletic delivery, doesn't consistently throw strikes and his command is even more sporadic. He does create deception with his mechanics and does a good job attacking hitters north and south, using an aggressive nature that could work well in a high-leverage bullpen role.",0
"GPE school pitchers from places like PERSON are invariably long-term projects. The ORGANIZATION knew this when they drafted ORGANIZATION, but they they thought it was a project worth taking on and going well over pick-value to do it.It might be a slow process with PERSON, but it's easy to see why the ORGANIZATION think there's a lot to tap into. He has good size at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and has already seen an uptick in velocity, up to the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. He uses his size well to throw downhill and there's even some deception due to a three-quarters arm slot. He throws a curve and a changeup and while both need work, he's shown a feel for each secondary offering . An ability to repeat his delivery should help him find the strike zone consistently.Talking about PERSON as a potential big league contributor would be extremely premature at this point, but with his potential, don't be shocked if he's in that conversation in the future.",0
"PERSON was an infielder at tiny PERSON, an ORGANIZATION program in GPE, when a lack of production moved him to the mound full-time. He became PERSON's ace and landed in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft, the first time any player from that program had been drafted. After a solid debut that summer, he needed PERSON surgery in NUMBER, and when he returned in NUMBER, he moved into the bullpen where, after shaking off the rust, he's been able to move quickly, reaching Triple-A in NUMBER.PERSON is now a prototypical two-pitch power pitcher. A fastball that sat in the low NUMBERs back during his PERSON days is now comfortably up in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range in shorter stints with a sneaky quick arm, which adds deception. His slider can be a little inconsistent, but when it's on, it shows very good depth. He misses a ton of bats, but command has been an issue from time to time, though he improved in that regard a bit in NUMBER. His power stuff means he doesn't have to have pinpoint command. He's definitely put himself on the radar as a viable bullpen piece for the big league staff with how he's returned from that NUMBER elbow surgery.

He encored with a strong sophomore season as the ORGANIZATION finished second at the NUMBER College World Series and topped the LOCATION in GPE (NUMBER.NUMBER) entering the ORGANIZATION playoffs as a junior. He also has bolstered his resume by performing well in stints with the GPE collegiate national team and in the ORGANIZATION League.ORGANIZATION doesn't have a standout tool, but his offensive potential and his solid speed and defensive skills make him one of the more well-rounded college position players in the NUMBER Draft class. A switch-hitter, he has a smooth swing and feel for the barrel from both sides, though scouts do have some concerns about swing-and-miss issues. He has driven the ball much more consistently this spring while continuing his penchant for drawing walks.While ORGANIZATION isn't a burner, he shows aptitude for stealing bases, and he uses good jumps and routes to cover plenty of ground in center field. If he has to move to an outfield corner, his below-average arm likely will relegate him to left field.",0
"Some projection-friendly traits for pitchers are: young age, size/frame, cold-weather background (they're raw, but also fresh from limited reps). PERSON, a NUMBER-foot-NUMBER Minnesota high school prospect, who was NUMBER on his draft day, has all of these, and also missed a whole year of innings rehabbing from PERSON. And yet, still just NUMBER, PERSON is in Double-A and on the doorstep of the big leagues. 
His size and arm slot create tough angle on his fastball and vertical depth on his curveball. One should feel free to project on the changeup and the still-lacking fastball control into PERSON' mid-NUMBERs because of the aforementioned traits and the ORGANIZATION. So while there's a chance PERSON winds up in the bullpen (where he could be a good multi-inning option) he also has realistic No. NUMBER starter upside. He was into the mid-NUMBERs with his fastball this spring and has a chance to debut this year if GPE is competitive and think he's one of the NUMBER best arms in the org.",0
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON was decent as a freshman and sophomore before taking a step forward and earning PERSON All-Star honors in the summer of NUMBER. He built on that momentum and hit the ball with more authority this spring, propelling him into the third round. The highest Rebels hitter selected since PERSON was an Athletics second-rounder in NUMBER, he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER.PERSON has a compact left-handed swing and a patient approach that produces line drives to all fields. He can catch up to quality fastballs and translated his deceptive strength into more power as a junior, hitting NUMBER homers to double his total from his first two seasons. He also has plus speed and good instincts on the bases, completing a package that could fit atop a lineup.PERSON's quickness and savvy allow him to cover ground in center field, where he displays average arm strength. He played second base as a ORGANIZATION freshman and would have even more value if he could play there, though the Royals have no immediate plans to use him in the infield. He has drawn comparisons to PERSON and PERSON that would hold more true if he moved to second.",0
"PERSON was regarded as one of the top prospects in GPE when PERSON signed him in NUMBER. Now, after slow but steady progress through the ORGANIZATION, he is close to realizing that potential and helping the Indians in the Majors.Defense has always been the strongest part of PERSON's game. His arm, glovework, range and ability to make plays while coming in all make him an above-average defender at third base.At the plate, PERSON isn't quite as advanced, but he has made strides recently. His hand-eye coordination makes him difficult to strike out, even though he is something of a free-swinger. PERSON has a good feel for hitting, and he makes good use of his solid raw power.",1
"Ranked No. NUMBER on MLBPipeline.com's Top NUMBER international prospects list entering the NUMBER July NUMBER signing period, GPE signed with the ORGANIZATION for a reported $NUMBER.NUMBER million as the ORGANIZATION were extremely active in the international market, signing five players from that Top NUMBER list.GPE sits at the top of that group, lauded as the best international prospect since PERSON and his talents have been compared to a young PERSON and PERSON. The ORGANIZATION teenager is a switch-hitter who has shown power from both sides of the plate. He has also displayed hitting mechanics and an approach at the plate that are beyond his years. PERSON and agile, GPE is a sound defensive player and has displayed good range in both directions. He has one of the best arms in the class and a high baseball IQ. PERSON also like his frame. Currently a shortstop, he profiles best as a third baseman in the future. Scouted since he was NUMBER, GPE tends to make the game look easy. Some see him as a once-in-a-generation type talent and no one would be surprised to see him jump up prospect lists once he gets his pro career going.",0
"One of the many international free agents the ORGANIZATION signed in NUMBER, PERSON has pitched well since making his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. He excites scouts both with his projectability and present three-pitch arsenal.  PERSON's fastball sits in the low- to mid-NUMBERs and reaches NUMBER mph. He has improved both his changeup and slider and both could be true weapons with a little more refinement. He doesn't have great command yet, but that should improve as he gets more comfortable with his delivery.  PERSON will be NUMBER for all of NUMBER and, while he isn't overly physical, should be able to add enough strength to his wiry frame to eliminate any lingering fears about his durability.",0
"PERSON battled the strike zone in two years at ORGANIZATION before boosting his stock by leading the ORGANIZATION with NUMBER saves and reaching NUMBER mph with his fastball during the summer of NUMBER. He decided to transfer to ORGANIZATION II power PERSON, where he continued to struggle to harness his power arsenal. That continued after the ORGANIZATION signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER in the fourth round last June.PERSON usually works with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that features armside run as a reliever and with a little less velocity when he starts. He also can miss bats with a pair of breaking balls, a low-NUMBERs curveball with good depth and an upper-NUMBERs slider/cutter, though he can't always land them in the strike zone. He also uses a changeup that might give him a decent offspeed pitch if he uses it more often.Though PERSON drafted PERSON with the idea of trying to develop him as a starter, club officials concede that his never-ending search for command means he'll likely be a reliever. He has cleaned up his delivery some since high school but it still contains a lot of effort and he has difficulty keeping it in sync. Coming out of the bullpen, he'd have late-inning upside if he could throw enough strikes.",0
"ORGANIZATION stands out as one of the more projectable high school arms in the NUMBER Draft. He's NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds with the room to add a lot of strength. He also has good body control for a tall youngster, allowing him to repeat his delivery and throw strikes with ease. It was those characteristics that earned him an above-slot bonus as the ORGANIZATION' fourth-round pick in June, as he became the highest-drafted player to ever come out of GPE (Ky.) High. ORGANIZATION's fastball velocity increased steadily throughout his high school career. He operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph, and his heater seems quicker because he gets good extension out front and his size creates tough angle and plane. He can throw his fastball to either side of the plate, with some sinking and tailing action.His secondary pitches are raw, but the ORGANIZATION are confident that both offerings will be average-or-better once fully developed. The right-hander has some shape but not much power to a curveball that he doesn't consistently stay on top of, and some scouts wonder if he'll need to switch to a slider. His changeup is also a work in progress.",0
"A NUMBER-game suspension now firmly in his rearview mirror, PERSON is building off of a solid NUMBER season that saw him finish the year in Double-A. He is close to knocking on the big league door.Though small in stature, it would be a mistake to underestimate PERSON due to size. He has a compact body with strength particularly in his wrists and forearms. With an advanced approach at the plate, a knack for making consistent contact and excellent speed, PERSON has the chance to be a true top-of-the-order catalyst. His defense, once very crude, has come a long way and he profiles well at second.PERSON is known for his hustle and hard-nosed style of play. He has the chance to be an everyday second baseman who can set the table well for the run producers in a big league lineup.",1
"Used exclusively as a reliever in his first two college seasons and while dominating the ORGANIZATION last summer -- he allowed one run while striking out NUMBER in NUMBER innings and was the co-MVP in the playoffs -- PERSON opened this spring in ORGANIZATION's rotation. He has the requisite three pitches and the durable build to make it as a starter, but he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in five outings before moving back to the bullpen and becoming the ORGANIZATION' closer. PERSON has a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that plays quicker because he throws it with late life and good downhill plane, though he has yet to prove he can maintain his velocity over long starts. He shows good feel for a sinking changeup and also has a three-quarters breaking ball that varies between a low-NUMBERs slider and an upper-NUMBERs curveball.PERSON's control and command have improved in each of his seasons at ORGANIZATION. Whichever team drafts him in the first three rounds this June will have to decide whether to develop him as a potential No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter or move him quickly as a possible high-leverage reliever.",0
"The ORGANIZATION gave $NUMBER million bonuses to two high school outfielders with baseball bloodlines in the NUMBER Draft, and PERSON massively outperformed PERSON in their first full pro seasons. A No. NUMBER overall pick and the younger brother of ORGANIZATION outfielder PERSON, PERSON batted .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER extra-base hits and NUMBER steals while advancing to high Class A. He has continued to rake in NUMBER, earning a promotion to Double-A by the end of May.Some scouts considered him the top hitter in the NUMBER prep class, and he has done nothing to dispel that notion. A product of the same Plant High (PERSON, Fla.) program that spawned ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION, PERSON has a smooth left-handed swing, quick hands, advanced pitch recognition and a patient approach. He has good leverage in his swing and likes to pull the ball, so he should grow into at least NUMBER-homer power as he gets stronger.A more well-rounded player than his brother, PERSON has spent most of his first two years as a pro in center field. He'll probably lose a step and become more of an average runner once he fills out, but he should fit nicely in right field with his solid arm and instincts. He runs the bases well, though he won't be a big threat to steal at higher levels.",1
"Drafted in the NUMBERth round in NUMBER by the ORGANIZATION as a catcher, PERSON was a full-time hitter as an GPE freshman before becoming a two-way player as a sophomore and solely a pitcher as a junior. He excited scouts by running his fastball up to NUMBER mph and showing a hard slider at the NUMBER Big Ten Conference tournament and in the ORGANIZATION, but he hasn't been as sharp this spring.PERSON has a big league body at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds and shows flashes of becoming a power pitcher. He's still reaching the mid-NUMBERs with his fastball, but he's not maintaining his velocity deep into games. He's dipping as low as NUMBER mph and usually pitching around NUMBER-NUMBER with minimal life.PERSON's breaking ball hasn't been as sharp in NUMBER and now resembles more of a curveball. He does show some feel for a sinking changeup but has a lot of work to do with his command. While he's understandably raw as a pitcher, he also has left scouts wishing he had made more progress this year.",0
"The former ORGANIZATION product has had trouble staying on the field, playing in just NUMBER games from the time he signed in NUMBER through the NUMBER season. Staying relatively healthy in NUMBER, PERSON performed solidly enough in the ORGANIZATION State League to earn a promotion to Double-A Altoona in July.When PERSON is healthy, he has shown glimpses of being able to do a little bit of everything. He swings the bat well, with solid bat speed and a good approach at the plate, giving him the chance to hit for average with average power. He runs well, though some of the leg issues he's had might contribute to him slowing down a touch. Initially a center fielder, he switched over to left field in NUMBER.Turning NUMBER in late July, there is some pressure for PERSON to start moving. That happened in NUMBER, thanks to his ability to stay off the disabled list more often than not for the first time in his career.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their third-round pick in NUMBER, targeting the GPE ORGANIZATION native for his immense raw power. That power was on full display in NUMBER and NUMBER, as PERSON finished second in the ORGANIZATION with NUMBER home runs the first year and won LOCATION MVP honors with NUMBER homers and NUMBER the following season. After a slow start in Triple-A in NUMBER, PERSON was rediscovering his power swing when he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in July.A physical specimen, PERSON's strength and explosive bat speed generate plus-plus raw power from line to line. He can get too pull-happy at times still, though there was progress in his overall approach in NUMBER. A former high school catcher, PERSON's above-average arm strength is a clean fit in right field, where his athleticism makes him an aggressive but average defender.PERSON checked all of the necessary development boxes in NUMBER and did so against advanced competition. Bouncing back from his sluggish first half of NUMBER, he still has the chance to be a run producer in a big league lineup.",1
"A solid high school prospect in NUMBER, PERSON was deemed unsignable, though the ORGANIZATION made a run at luring him away from GPE. Now, three years later, PERSON is back as one of the toolsier college bats in the class. And he certainly looks the part, strong and athletic, with the ability to hit for power and run well. After a solid Cape Cod League season last summer, PERSON wasn't able to show what he could do during his junior year until early April because of a stress reaction in his elbow. That gave him just enough time to show scouts he was healthy and prove he can turn his tools into consistent performance. There is a stigma surrounding GPE hitters, and PERSON will have to fight past that. He has the tools to do that and profile as an athletic right fielder when all is said and done.",0
"PERSON was a three-year starter at shortstop for GPE, helping the GPE make the ORGANIZATION World Series as a freshman in NUMBER. Unlike most college shortstops, he has a good chance to stick at the position, which helped him go in the sixth round of the NUMBER Draft. He has hit better than expected at the onset of his pro career, even holding his own in Double-A after getting promoted there out of necessity in late June.Nevertheless, it's PERSON's glove that will be his ticket to the big leagues. He has smooth middle-infield actions, solid range to both sides and arm strength to match. He has shuttled between shortstop and second base while also seeing action at third base and in center field, hinting at his possible future as a utilityman.PERSON offers little pop at the plate, so he mainly focuses on making contact from the right side. He has decent plate discipline and fits best at the bottom of a batting order. Though he's just an average runner out of the batter's box, he plays quicker on the bases and has the savvy to accrue some steals.",0
"A teammate of GPE first-rounder PERSON at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Ala.), PERSON spurned the Indians as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER to stay home and attend GPE. He has been a power-hitting presence in the middle of the ORGANIZATION lineup since day one as a freshman and ranked second with NUMBER home runs entering the ORGANIZATION Division I tournament this year. With the exception of Reds NUMBER first-rounder PERSON, he's the best prospect in GPE history.PERSON proved himself with wood bats against quality competition last summer in the ORGANIZATION, where he ranked third in extra-base hits (NUMBER) and fourth in slugging (.NUMBER). He doesn't have the prettiest right-handed swing, but he's exceptionally strong and makes enough contact to do damage. He's also willing to take a walk when pitchers are loathe to challenge him. A good athlete for his size, PERSON has average speed out of the box and is a shade quicker once he gets going. His solid arm strength helps him fit the profile in right field, where he gets the job done.",0
"PERSON comes from a baseball family, with a father and uncle who both played at LOCATION. His dad went on to coach at his alma mater and at ORGANIZATION, while his uncle spent NUMBER years in the ORGANIZATION. The younger PERSON jumped on the map as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, scuffled as a sophomore, but has bounced back with a strong junior season, at least with the bat.The switch-hitting backstop has swung the bat well, especially in the second half of his junior season, using an advanced approach at the plate to hit for average and power while drawing a ton of walks. It's more power over hit, with some concern over him hitting enough at the next level to tap consistently into that raw pop. PERSON's defensive game, however, has not taken the same step forward this year. Not overly athletic, he hasn't been very agile behind the plate and his blocking and receiving have been inconsistent, as has been his arm.College catching is always hard to find, and PERSON has done it for three years at ORGANIZATION. PERSON will be buying the bat here, with the hope that he'll defend just well enough to stick there as an offensive-minded catcher.",0
"Louisiana-Lafayette had a storybook regular season, going NUMBER-NUMBER to match the school record for wins and posting the best league mark in ORGANIZATION play at NUMBER-NUMBER. Adding to the intrigue is the fact that that coach PERSON's top pitcher is also his son.Austin PERSON fills the strike zone with three average pitches. He throws his sinker at NUMBER-NUMBER mph, his curveball in the mid-NUMBERs and his changeup in the low NUMBERs. On any given day, any of his offerings can be his best weapon.Though PERSON has advanced feel for pitching, there are some concerns. He's extremely skinny at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds, and some scouts don't love his arm action or the effort in his delivery. That leads to concerns about durability, and he did miss two starts this spring with biceps tendinitis.",0
"PERSON PERSON's development made PERSON redundant on the ORGANIZATION, so they sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for right-handers PERSON and PERSON in November NUMBER. While PERSON helped PERSON win the NUMBER World Series, GPE has no complaints with the deal because PERSON shows the upside of a frontline starter and PERSON became the headline prospect in the ORGANIZATION trade with the ORGANIZATION. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON has missed time with a shoulder strain, appendectomy and elbow inflammation the last two years but has impressed when he has taken the mound.When PERSON is at his best, he exhibits command of three pitches that all grade as plus or better. His fastball usually runs from NUMBER-NUMBER mph, tops out in the triple digits and features sink and run that generate both swings and misses as well as weak ground-ball contact. His power breaking ball looks like a curveball at times and a slider at others, more often the former, and he also can miss bats with his fading changeup.PERSON has a bit of a short-arm delivery that adds deception, making him all the more difficult to hit. His walk rate dropped from NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings in three years in the ORGANIZATION system to NUMBER.NUMBER in his first with the ORGANIZATION, quieting talk that he might be destined for the bullpen. He still needs more consistency with his secondary pitches and his command but made encouraging progress in those areas last year.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION's male athlete of the year in NUMBER after starring in four sports at FACILITY (Calif.) High, PERSON lasted NUMBER rounds in the Draft that June in part because he had a poor junior season in the diamond. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER, he spent two years in GPE ball and led the ORGANIZATION with NUMBER homers in NUMBER but was overmatched in his first taste of Class A in NUMBER. He continued to struggle when he returned there in NUMBER but surged after a second-half promotion to Class A Advanced, where he hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER homers in NUMBER games. PERSON's bat speed and leverage give him above-average raw power that he began to translate into game production once he began managing the strike zone better in Class A Advanced. He'll need to prove that he can make consistent contact and continue to exhibit patience against more advanced competition, but the progress he made in NUMBER is encouraging. So too were the four homers he drilled in NUMBER games in the ORGANIZATION. After splitting his time between center and left field in his first three pro seasons, PERSON spent most of NUMBER at the latter position. He has average speed once he gets going and has worked diligently to improve his arm strength from well below average to fringy.",0
"Now NUMBER, PERSON was scuttled around various orgs in NUMBER (ORGANIZATION, then ORGANIZATION, then ORGANIZATION). He has one of the fastest arms in pro baseball. He sits NUMBER and touches NUMBER, but has no idea where it's going. We think altering his stride length and direction might solve some of his issues but he also might just be a guy who never repeats his delivery. He could be a dynamite bullpen arm or nothing at all.",0
"Hailing from the southern GPE high school ranks, PERSON springboarded from a strong summer showcase to a spring that saw him continue to excel, moving up boards and landing as the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. The ORGANIZATION signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million, well under pick value, and PERSON had a solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, though fatigue and a minor hip flexor slowed him temporarily.PERSON has considerable tools that should excite ORGANIZATION fans. He can flat-out rake, making consistent hard contact from the left side of the plate. He started showing more power during his senior year and he could approach PERSON average pop as a pro. Perhaps more impressive than his innate ability to barrel up the ball is his IQ at the plate, with an approach far advanced for his age and a willingness to use all fields. PERSON runs very well, allowing him to be a threat on the bases and to cover a lot of ground in center field, where he has the chance to be an elite defender.PERSON was already gaining good weight and adding strength last fall, something that served him well in his first full season of pro ball. His instincts, work ethic and natural tools all point to him living up to the expectations usually heaped on a ORGANIZATION. NUMBER pick's shoulders.",0
"A two-way talent at GPE, PERSON impressed scouts with his left-handed power potential but most teams liked him better on the mound. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER as the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall choice in the NUMBER Draft, he made his first big league start last July, though he was shut down shortly afterward with nerve irritation in his elbow. He went through the worst stretch of his career when he opened NUMBER in Triple-A before taking six weeks off to deal with anxiety issues.PERSON's stuff regressed a bit in NUMBER, leaving him with just one above-average offering. His sharp curveball is his best offering and can be a plus pitch at its best. His lively fastball sat in the upper NUMBERs last year but had previously resided in the low NUMBERs. His sinking changeup wasn't quite as deceptive as it had been, while his cutter mainly served to give batters a different look.PERSON has the best feel for pitching among ORGANIZATION farmhands, so he doesn't have to overpower hitters to succeed. He can add and subtract from his pitches and locate them where he wants, usually down in the strike zone. Whether or not his stuff ticks back up with determine if he's an option for the middle or back of a rotation.",1
"After two nondescript years at ORGANIZATION, PERSON jumped on the radar with a strong junior season, building off an All-Star campaign in the ORGANIZATION League the previous summer. The top college prospect in GPE in the NUMBER Draft class, he was taken by the ORGANIZATION in the fourth round and given a slightly above-pick value bonus to sign. Pitching in relief in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League during his debut, PERSON struck out NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings, then followed it up with a solid first full year in the LOCATION, once again striking out better than NUMBER per nine.With a quick arm and a strong frame, PERSON can run his fastball up to NUMBER mph and sit at NUMBER-NUMBER and while his velocity had dipped after heavy use in his last college season, he proved durable and effective over his first full season, finishing with NUMBER innings pitched. He's fiddled with different versions of a breaking ball in the past, but now features a hard slider/cutter that has good, late life. PERSON can spin a curveball with good depth and has aptitude for throwing a changeup. His fastball, slider and changeup all can be plus pitches at their best, so he has the ingredients to start. In order to succeed in that role as he moves up the ORGANIZATION' ladder, he will have to continue to refine his overall control and command (NUMBER.NUMBER BB/NUMBER through NUMBER).",0
"As PERSON was breaking out in NUMBER in the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' system, PERSON was doing the same in the lower levels. Making his professional debut, the NUMBER-year-old excelled, first in the ORGANIZATION and then the GPE, where he was the third-youngest position player. He was having an impressive sophomore campaign, too, before he fractured his right thumb in GPE, prematurely ending his NUMBER season.PERSON makes a lot of contact, thanks to his quick swing, excellent hand-eye coordination and innate feel for the barrel. He has a line-drive stroke and, while power will never be a part of his game, drives the gaps well. His above-average speed gives him all the tools to fit at the top of the order.PERSON has a strong arm, and scouts believe he has the skills necessary to remain at shortstop. The island of GPE has produced several talented middle infielders in recent years, and PERSON has a strong chance to continue the line.",1
"PERSON began his college career at GPE (GPE) JC in NUMBER before transferring to GPE, where he suffered serious head injuries and needed subsequent gall bladder surgery after his car was rear-ended in a high-speed accident. He pitched just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in two years with the ORGANIZATION, then won ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year honors in the summer of NUMBER and transferred to LOCATION A&M. He led ORGANIZATION II in strikeouts (NUMBER) and strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) before becoming the highest pick in GPE history, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-rounder.PERSON has continued to miss bats at an exceptional rate since turning pro, doing so with basically one pitch. He challenges hitters with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that seems to rise at the plate. He throws over the top, a la PERSON, and opponents have trouble picking up his heater because it seems to come straight out of his ear.Whether PERSON can survive on fastballs alone at higher levels remains to be seen. He also has a curveball that gets NUMBER-NUMBER break from his delivery but arrives in the low NUMBERs, and he's fiddling with a changeup that has a long ways to go. He battles the strike zone but has gotten away with it so far because his heater has been unhittable.",0
"After going undrafted as a ORGANIZATION high school senior in NUMBER, ORGANIZATION headed to the ORGANIZATION (Conn.) PERSON -- a prep school -- instead of college. The move paid off as he went in the third round in June and signed for $NUMBER million.ORGANIZATION added strength during his year at ORGANIZATION, which helped boost his fastball from the upper NUMBERs to the low NUMBERs, with a high of NUMBER mph. He also has a hard curveball and could have two above-average pitches when he's fully developed. His changeup needs a lot of work but he shows the ability to throw all three of his offerings for strikes.ORGANIZATION is physically mature and doesn't have as much projection as the typical non-college Draft pick. However, he also has a frame for durability and the upside of a No. NUMBER starter.",0
"GPE school pitchers aren't supposed to get to the big leagues quickly, and certainly not in their first full professional season. But PERSON lived up to his billing as a prepster with an advanced feel for pitching by reaching GPE in September NUMBER after being the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick in the NUMBER Draft. Since then, though, the express train was derailed by PERSON surgery in June NUMBER and by shoulder inflammation in NUMBER.When healthy, PERSON has a fastball in the mid-to-upper NUMBERs, though he was a tick or two below that upon his return from elbow surgery. Both his curve and changeup can be at least above-average pitches when he's NUMBER percent, and his command should be solid as well.The PERSON had hoped the NUMBER season would be about PERSON getting a full year's workload in, but the shoulder injury kept that from happening and somewhat clouded his future.",1
"PERSON ORGANIZATION had a pair of talented offensive performers in its lineup in NUMBER, and scouts came in often to see both PERSON and first baseman PERSON. PERSON's power-speed combination, which had intrigued some when he was a GPE high schooler back in NUMBER, helped him trump Sheets by three picks in the second round. After signing for just over $NUMBER.NUMBER million, PERSON went to the Rookie-level PERSON to make his pro debut. While PERSON had an up-and-down collegiate career, with an All-America freshman season followed by a rougher sophomore campaign, he came on strong as a junior. He has a higher ceiling than many college hitters from this Draft class, with the strength and bat speed to hit for power. His plus speed should allow him to steal bases and perhaps stick in center field long-term. He draws walks and isn't afraid to wear a pitch to get on base. Not everyone was completely sold on PERSON's swing from the right side, with some concerned about his ability to hit enough to tap into that power, especially after he struggled with wood in his hands during the ORGANIZATION League a summer ago. More consistent contact and improved reads and routes could make him a true center field prospect, though a move to left eventually could be in the offing.",0
"The ORGANIZATION are no strangers to being aggressive on the international market, particularly when GPE players become available. They jumped at the chance to sign PERSON, who was No. NUMBER on ORGANIZATION's Top NUMBER ORGANIZATION list when he got $NUMBER.NUMBER million from the ORGANIZATION to sign. After impressing early with his bullpen sessions and showing initial polish similar to fellow PERSON, the right-hander appeared to get away from his strengths during a rocky first pro season in NUMBER.The NUMBER season was a nice step forward for PERSON. He did a good job of finding his delivery, which enabled him to stay on top of the ball better and created a better angle. As a result, he had better action on his pitches and a more consistent break on his curveball, which lost its sharpness when he would get under or on the side of the ball. But he wasn't able to repeat that success in NUMBER.An improved tempo also increased PERSON's ability to pound the strike zone in NUMBER, though his walk rate spiked the following season.. With a three-pitch mix that gives him a good chance to start, PERSON's fastball touches as high as NUMBER-NUMBER mph.

His low NUMBERs curveball continues to improve and will flash above average to plus on occasion. PERSON continues to work on his changeup, which might be an average pitch when all is said and done, and he's working in a new cutter, with slider-like action, this season.

Unfortunately, he missed all but NUMBER total games of the NUMBER season because of a hamstring issue he had difficulty shaking. Once he did, though, he performed the way everyone expected him to.PERSON has a smooth swing from the left side of the plate with an advanced approach, especially for someone of his age and experience level. He's more of a line-drive type right now, using all fields, but the bat speed is there to project more power as he matures. PERSON has excellent speed that helps him cover a lot of ground in center field, though it hasn't translated to stolen base success. He should be able to stick in center long-term, albeit with a slightly below-average arm. He should fit the profile of a left fielder offensively should he have to move.PERSON missed a considerable amount of development time in NUMBER and there certainly is no pressing need in the ORGANIZATION outfield. Still, PERSON' offensive ability should allow him to start moving more quickly now that he's healthy.",0
"PERSON was ranked No. NUMBER on MLBPipeline.com's Top NUMBER international prospect list in NUMBER, and the ORGANIZATION loved his athleticism and makeup enough to give him $NUMBER million to sign in July of that summer.

The switch-hitting infielder is a stronger hitter from the right side, where he can make consistent contact with a line-drive swing. It's gap power right now, but he might grow into a little more in the future, especially as he refines his approach. His best offensive tool is his speed, and it's plus, which should allow him to be a basestealing threat. It also helps him cover a lot of ground in the infield, with his range and feet giving him a chance to stay at short. His arm might not. He has fringy arm strength and struggles with his mechanics at times, with some thinking he might end up at second or in center field. For now, he'll continue to get work at shortstop, where he'll continue trying to live up to the comps to Jose PERSON that were dropped on him when he was an amateur.",0
"Originally drafted in the NUMBERth round by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was a part of the package the ORGANIZATION received in the ORGANIZATION trade in NUMBER. PERSON was named the 'NUMBER PERSON of the Year.PERSON stands out for his fastball, which routinely reaches NUMBER mph. That kind of velocity, combined with the good downhill plane his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame generates, makes it very difficult to square up. PERSON's changeup is an average offering, while his slider lags behind. His command is well below average, and he will have to learn how to harness his stuff to find success in the big leagues.PERSON underwent PERSON surgery in GPE, ending his season. That, combined with his command issues, may be enough to make him a reliever again.",1
"The son of Louisiana-Lafayette coach PERSON, PERSON helped the ORGANIZATION' Cajuns match the school record for wins and reach PERSON in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the NUMBERth round and sent him to Rookie-level Orem to make his debut.Robichaux fills the strike zone with his whole three-pitch arsenal. He gets good sinking action on his low-NUMBERs fastball, and effectively mixes in a curveball and changeup. On any given day, any of his offerings can be his best weapon. PERSON has advanced feel for pitching, there are concerns about his durability. He missed two starts during his junior season with bicep tendinitis and there's some effort in his delivery. That might mean he ends up in the bullpen in the long run, but his understanding of the craft gives him a chance to move quickly in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Signed for just $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON had a spectacular GPE debut two years later. He won the ORGANIZATION League batting title with a .NUMBER average and also led the Rookie-level circuit in on-base percentage (.NUMBER), runs (NUMBER), hits (NUMBER) and total bases (NUMBER).PERSON uses his strong forearms to whip the bat through the strike zone. His swing is flat and geared more toward line drives at this point, but he should produce at least gap power and could be a home run threat if he adds some strength and loft down the road. He uses the entire field and has better plate discipline and pitch recognition than most players his age.PERSON also has the plus speed to steal bases and run down balls from gap to gap in center field. There's no reason he should have to shift a corner, but he does have the solid arm strength to fit in right field if needed.",1
"ORGANIZATION was billed as the top pure hitter in the NUMBER Draft class, especially from the college ranks, and the hope was he would be the type who could move quickly through a farm system. After the ORGANIZATION product went No. NUMBER overall to the ORGANIZATION, he's lived up to the hype, batting his way to Double-A in his first full season and actually hitting better once he got to that advanced level. He was red-hot in Triple-A in 'NUMBER -- despite a bout with vertigo -- when a fracture in his right index finger required surgery and ended his season. When healthy, ORGANIZATION uses a combination of strength and bat speed, along with an advanced approach at the plate, to be an extremely dangerous hitter from the right side. He makes consistent hard contact, doesn't strike out a lot and draws walks, which points to a future of hitting over .NUMBER and perhaps competing for batting titles. While ORGANIZATION is not a pure power type, he did have NUMBER extra-base hits in NUMBER and homered NUMBER times in NUMBER at-bats in Double-A. ORGANIZATION is not a burner on the base paths, but he is very aggressive and has excellent instincts that allow him to pick up some steals and take extra bases. His plus arm works very well from the hot corner and he's worked to improve his hands and footwork, and can stay there long-term, though the ORGANIZATION had him playing second and even some shortstop to increase his versatility. There isn't much more for ORGANIZATION to prove at the ORGANIZATION level, but he'll have to wait until NUMBER to put on the finishing touches of his development and show what he can do in GPE.",0
"Since being a top NUMBER pick back in NUMBER, PERSON' pro career has been one of contradiction. On the one hand, the toolsy outfielder has had trouble staying healthy, with hamstring issues, a broken orbital bone and an oblique injury that prevented him from going to the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, all keeping him off the field. At the same time, the GPE native reached Triple-A at age NUMBER, which is well ahead of the curve.The main reason PERSON has been able to move so quickly despite the interruptions has been his advanced approach at the plate and his innate ability to hit for average regardless of time away. He has a very smooth left-handed swing, one that has largely featured a hit-first approach, though the power started to show up a bit more in NUMBER. He draws walks and does not strike out a ton, though he struggled a bit in Triple-A for the first time. PERSON' reads and routes in center field have improved, and he should be an outstanding defender there with an accurate, albeit slightly below-average, arm.Part of the reason rumors spread about the ORGANIZATION' willingness to trade PERSON during last offseason was because PERSON is nearly ready, though repeated hamstring issues in NUMBER kept him from banging down that door.",1
"A product of PERSON in GPE, alma mater of big leaguer PERSON and former first-round pick PERSON, PERSON was one of the better pure hitters in the NUMBER Draft class. While injuries have slowed his progress somewhat, he still reached Triple-A at age NUMBER last year and was added to the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER-man roster this past offseason. He made his big league debut in NUMBER, riding the Louisville-ORGANIZATION shuttle on multiple occasions.PERSON's best tool is still his bat and approach at the plate. He draws walks and works counts and even while dealing with wrist issues, continues to hit for a high average. His patience has allowed him to post a career on-base percentage of close to .NUMBER while hitting nearly .NUMBER in his ORGANIZATION career. His power took a step back in NUMBER, but he has shown extra-base ability in the past and now past the wrist issues, should be able to add more over-the-fence ability as he continues to mature and learn when he can turn on pitches effectively.A below-average runner, PERSON has played both corner outfield spots but is likely a left fielder at the highest level because of his below-average arm, but he should be an acceptable defender there. PERSON's surprising NUMBER notwithstanding, PERSON still appears to be the future in left for ORGANIZATION.",1
"There may not have been a better bet to hit in the NUMBER Draft than PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION considered taking with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick before opting for PERSON. Selected sixth overall by the ORGANIZATION and signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER, he wound up in GPE as part of a trade for PERSON a year later and started to come into some power in the second half of NUMBER. He slumped to .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER in Triple-A in NUMBER before bouncing back with the best numbers of his career in NUMBER and earning a callup in GPE, then went to the ORGANIZATION as part of the GPE deal this January.Known for his pure left-handed swing and his ability to barrel balls easily while controlling the strike zone, PERSON made adjustments after his whiff rate spiked to a career-high NUMBER percent in NUMBER. He added some loft to his stroke and started to look to pull pitches more often, allowing him to tap in more to his strength. He's not the walk machine he was in college at FACILITY but still draws his share of free passes.PERSON has the hands and solid arm to play the hot corner but lacks range there. He's a well below-average runner whose only other real defensive option is first base, though he also has seen time in left field this year.",1
"A senior sign out of GPE in NUMBER, GPE began his pro career as a starter, but a NUMBER move to the bullpen seems to have been a wise choice after the right-hander led the organization in saves in NUMBER and pitched his way to his big league debut in late May.Armed with a power repertoire and a bulldog approach on the mound, GPE looks like he has found a home in short relief. His fastball will sit in the mid-NUMBERs and he can reach back for more. His best secondary pitch is now a cutter/slider offering, a hard breaking ball. From his days as a starter, he throws more pitches than your typical bullpen guy, mixing in a curve that can be average at times as well. His command is well below-average and he doesn't miss as many bats as you'd think given his pure stuff, leading some to think he may not close at the highest level. At the very least, GPE is looking like a future setup man.",0
"After going to the ORGANIZATION in a NUMBER PERSON deal with the ORGANIZATION, PERSON made his Major ORGANIZATION debut the next year. He made another brief appearance in GPE in NUMBER before the ORGANIZATION traded him to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON on the day after Thanksgiving.PERSON has the makings of a solid starting pitcher and works with a four-pitch arsenal. His fastball sits around NUMBER mph and he commands it well, especially in the bottom of the zone. PERSON's curve is more of a ""get-it-over"" pitch early in counts, but he can work his slider and changeup off of his fastball effectively. PERSON has a good feel for pitching and mixes his pitches well, keeping hitters off balance. After spending the majority of the last two years at Triple-A, he is nearly ready for an extended look in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"The ORGANIZATION gave bonuses of $NUMBER,NUMBER or more to four international shortstops during the NUMBER-NUMBER signing period, spending $NUMBER million to land PERSON out of GPE. Because he was the oldest of that group at age NUMBER, they've pushed him the fastest, sending him to the Rookie-level Appalachian League for his pro debut last summer. He's a quality athlete with the chance to contribute in all phases of the game.PERSON's speed and defense are more advanced than his offense at this point. He makes playing shortstop look easy, effortlessly gliding to balls and using his quickness and strong arm to make plays. He's a plus runner who will be a basestealing threat once he learns the nuances of that craft.PERSON has more offensive upside than the typical shortstop. He has a sound left-handed swing, barrels a lot of balls and understands the strike zone. Once he adds some much-needed strength to his slight frame, he could produce double-digit home run power.",0
"PERSON has an unusual profile. He bats right-handed and throws left-handed, he's as athletic as it comes among first basemen and -- unheard of at his position -- his power might be weakest among all of his tools. He has produced and improved throughout three seasons at ORGANIZATION, and he should join PERSON (ORGANIZATION, NUMBER) as the only Wildcats position players ever to get drafted in the first round.PERSON manages the strike zone well and usually focuses on hitting line drives from gap to gap with a relatively flat swing. He has good bat speed and a long frame built to create leverage, so power should come once he adds more strength to his body and more loft to his swing. He's starting to turn on more pitches this spring, which bodes well for his future.Whichever team drafts PERSON will have to decide whether to deploy him as a potential ORGANIZATION first baseman or to try him in the outfield. Former Wildcats coach PERSON thought he had the tools to try center field in pro ball. A plus runner with solid arm strength, PERSON handled himself well on the outfield corners with the GPE college national team last summer.",0
"Two main things stood out as PERSON came out of high school in NUMBER: His power and his size. He didn't get to show it in games in NUMBER after receiving an above-slot bonus, but it was on display at two stops in the Minors in NUMBER. He can hit the ball out of any park, to any field. He isn't a one-trick pony at the plate, though. He has excellent plate discipline with a lot of bat speed and projects to be a good all-around hitter. PERSON was overweight as an amateur, but he worked hard to trim down, something he'll have to watch for the remainder of his career. Even with better conditioning, he's a well-below-average runner who will never be better than average defensively, so his bat will have to propel him up the ladder.",0
"PERSON spent the first two years of his college career at GPE, but transferred to PERSON for his junior season. After a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION over the summer, he has stepped in as the ORGANIZATION' ace and has helped them be one of the top ORGANIZATION teams in the country.Now NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, PERSON has some projection, with the chance to add velocity as he adds strength to his frame. He's already up to NUMBER mph with his fastball and comfortably sits around NUMBER mph. His low-NUMBERs slider is inconsistent, but shows depth and tilt enough to make you think it can be an average pitch in the future. He'll flash a solid changeup with fade on occasion as well. PERSON has missed bats this year at a good clip, but command has eluded him, both in and out of the strike zone, leading to a high walk rate and getting hit more than he should. Still, his live arm and good frame could point to a future in the back of a rotation, enough for a team to consider him in the top six rounds.",0
"The second of two college pitchers the ORGANIZATION took atop the NUMBER Draft, PERSON excelled as GPE's Friday starter. He's not the biggest guy in the world, but clearly that doesn't scare away GPE. PERSON can get his fastball up to NUMBER mph, and it has above-average run and sink. His secondary stuff, a breaking ball and changeup, both should be solid average pitches in the future, and PERSON has shown the ability to mix his pitches well and keep hitters guessing. With his size and his ability to reach back for a little more velocity when needed, some see a future in the bullpen, but don't count out PERSON's ability to make it to GPE as a starter just yet.",0
"PERSON is one of the many high-ceiling prep pitchers the ORGANIZATION grabbed in recent Drafts. His early results weren't indicative of his talents, but his tools started to line up with his performance in NUMBER, as he reached Double-A PERSON as a NUMBER-year-old. After that successful season, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION as a part of the three-team trade that sent PERSON Myers from the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION.PERSON throws his fastball, which regularly hits the mid NUMBERs, from a good downhill angle, creating lots of ground balls. His power slider gives him a second above-average pitch, but the development of his changeup will be critical to his future. PERSON' older brother PERSON has pitched in the ORGANIZATION for the past five years. Though it might still be a couple years before PERSON is ready to join him in the big leagues, he has the potential to be a solid starter in time.",1
"PERSON signed as an over slot NUMBERth rounder ($NUMBER,NUMBER) in NUMBER and in his first full pro season was the NUMBER minor league ORGANIZATION leader and the ORGANIZATION' PERSON of the Year. Big-conference college arms are supposed to carve up Low-A, but PERSON was especially dominant. He struck out NUMBER and walked just NUMBER in NUMBER innings, most of which came at ORGANIZATION. He has plus command of average stuff, with the changeup flashing above, and the stuff plays up against lefties because of PERSON's lower arm slot. There's significant risk that upper-level hitters tee off on his fastball, but PERSON might do enough other stuff to offset the lack of velo and pitch at the back of a rotation. If the latter happens, PERSON should materialize as viable big league depth pretty quickly.",0
"It's said that speed can't be taught. That's fine for GPE, who has more than enough of hit naturally to be an intriguing prospect.The fastest player in the ORGANIZATION system, GPE rates at the top of the scouting scale as an NUMBER runner. A former multi-sport standout, the other part of his game are a bit raw, but he's not without tools. He's willing to work counts and draw walks, knowing his job is to get on base. He has some strength, unlike some pure speed guys, giving hope that there's some hitting ability to be unlocked. He will need to cut down on his strikeouts in order for that to happen. He uses his speed well on the basepaths as an efficient basestealer, something that will only improve as he learns the nuances of his craft. He covers a ton of ground in center field, showing improvement on his reads and routes.GPE's plus tool will give him many opportunities. If the bat comes around, he could be more than just speed off of the bench.",0
"He threw in the low NUMBERs as a left-handed reliever at GPE, but it was PERSON's bat that got him drafted in the fourth round in NUMBER. After failing to take full advantage of a short right-field porch at low Class A Asheville in NUMBER, he got his power going last year and led the Minors in doubles (NUMBER) and extra-base hits (NUMBER) while batting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER and reaching Double-A.A big man with long arms, PERSON had a lot going on with his left-handed swing when he entered pro ball but has calmed it down without costing himself any leverage. He's doing a better job of handling breaking balls and southpaws, and he still offers impressive bat speed and strength. If he can learn to control the strike zone better, he could be a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER homers per season.PERSON has surprising athleticism for his size and is aggressive on the bases with his average speed. He's a natural fit in right field with his strong, accurate arm and has also seen time in left and center. The ORGANIZATION also have played him at first base to increase his versatility.",1
"PERSON's high price tag as a Draft-eligible sophomore in NUMBER scared away many teams, and he ultimately turned down the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-round pick to return to PERSON. As a junior, PERSON once again ranked among the LOCATION's premier starters and helped lead the ORGANIZATION to a runner-up finish in the NUMBER College World Series. The GPE, after selecting PERSON in the third round in June, went $NUMBER,NUMBER above slot to sign the right-hander for $NUMBER.NUMBER million.PERSON may be extremely skinny, listed at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds, but he has some power to his fastball, which sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and peaks at NUMBER. He also has a mid-NUMBERs slider that has a high spin rate and qualifies as a plus pitch at its best. He also will mix in an effective changeup and a curveball he can throw for strikes. PERSON has a quick arm and generates velocity without much effort in a repeatable delivery that allows him to fill the strike zone.PERSON's stuff stands to improve in the professional ranks if he can add weight to his wiry frame. It also would help answer questions about his durability, especially after PERSON held him out of summer ball for two straight years and limited him in fall practice as a junior. It's a mid-rotation profile if all comes together for PERSON, though he's likely to be brought along slowly given the relevant concerns about his durability.",0
"PERSON put on a show with his power during a ORGANIZATION workout in NUMBER, leading the ORGANIZATION to pay him an over-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus as a fifth-rounder. He wasn't ready for full-season ball until his third year as a pro, but he displayed plenty of pop (NUMBER homers) and patience (NUMBER walks) in NUMBER-NUMBER once he got there. He reached Double-A at age NUMBER last August and handled himself well there in the final month and again in NUMBER.With bat speed, strength and loft in his swing, PERSON has the best raw power of any left-handed hitter in GPE's system. The question is whether he'll make enough contact to get the most out of it because he gets aggressive and lengthens his swing, resulting in a NUMBER percent strikeout rate though his first four seasons. He does manage deep counts and take walks, but more advanced pitchers aren't going to work around him as often if they can get him to chase.PERSON has to hit because he's limited athletically. He has worked hard on his conditioning and defense, but he still has well below-average speed and will be adequate at best at first base. His only other option would be DH, which would put even more pressure on his bat.",0
"The first college position player selected by the Rockies in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a seventh-rounder out of PERSON. His bat will have to carry him and has so far early in his pro career. He enjoyed a solid pro debut and has been one of the best hitters in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION in NUMBER.PERSON's best tool is his plus raw power from the right side of the plate, though he employs a mature approach and resists the temptation to swing for the fences. With his bat speed, strength and discipline, he could hit for average and power and do some damage if he makes it to PERSON. Recruited as a catcher by PERSON, PERSON spent most of his college career at ORGANIZATION with limited time at first base. He led short-season LOCATION first basemen with NUMBER errors in NUMBER games during his pro debut but has worked hard and looked better this year. He probably will be an adequate defender at best and doesn't offer much speed on the basepaths.",0
"The ORGANIZATION haven't produced an impact type talent internally since PERSON made his way to GPE. While it would be completely unfair to compare PERSON to the perennial ORGANIZATION candidate, the organization is nearly as excited about the NUMBER second-round pick's future as they were about their NUMBER first-rounder.PERSON' game has vastly improved across the board since he began his pro career. He comes from a football background as a receiver in high school -- his father played in the ORGANIZATION as did one brother, with a second brother playing collegiately -- and he has quickly translated his plus athleticism to performance on the diamond. His baseball IQ is off the charts on both sides of the ball. He'll use a refined up-the-middle approach and he's already starting to grow into his power, showing the ability to backspin balls into the right-center field gap. His plus speed is an asset and he maximizes it by being a smart baserunner and by improving his reads and routes in center field, where he has the potential to stay long term.Obviously, he might have to move in deference to that Trout fellow, but he has the arm and offensive profile to be just fine in a corner. With off-the-charts makeup and work ethic, don't be surprised to see PERSON start to move a little more quickly and vault up prospect rankings.",0
"PERSON saw limited action at GPE (GPE) JC as a freshman in NUMBER before transferring to GPE (Mo.) JC, where he was a two-way player who drew comparisons to PERSON on the mound. The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON as a left-handed pitcher in the NUMBERst round of the NUMBER Draft, but he chose to transfer to PERSON and performed better for the ORGANIZATION as an outfielder. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER, he has shown more power and speed in pro ball than he did as an amateur.PERSON offers considerable raw power from the left side of the plate, though he's still learning to maximize it. His NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame gives him good leverage but also a long stroke that has led to swing-and-miss issues since he made the jump to full-season ball this year. He could stand to add some loft to his swing because he hits too many ground balls for someone with his pop.Surprising for someone his size, PERSON grades as a plus runner and could be a NUMBER-NUMBER player one day if he gets regular at-bats at ORGANIZATION. After playing exclusively in right field during his pro debut, he has seen most of his action in left field this year. His arm, which delivered NUMBER-NUMBER fastballs in college, is strong enough for either position.",0
"PERSON was a two-way star at GPE, hitting NUMBER homers and winning NUMBER games while leading the ORGANIZATION to three straight PERSON from NUMBER-NUMBER. The NUMBERst overall pick in the 'NUMBER PERSON, PERSON signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million, but he had his pro debut truncated when a line drive broke multiple bones in his face during the annual Futures at ORGANIZATION event.PERSON lost weight because he was unable to eat solid food for months, and his stuff was down at the start of NUMBER. But after he added strength and shook off a bout of shoulder tendinitis, he showed why the ORGANIZATION made him a first-round pick. PERSON spotted his fastball, which sat around NUMBER mph and touched NUMBER, to both sides of the plate, and he backed it up with a sharper curveball than he had thrown as an amateur.PERSON also has a sinking changeup and a cutter in his repertoire. His command is better than he showed in his first full pro season, and it helps give him a ceiling as a No. NUMBER starter.",0
"ORGANIZATION starred as a quarterback at ORGANIZATION in GPE, GPE, following in the footsteps of PERSON winners PERSON and PERSON, as well as college stars PERSON and PERSON. He had a brighter future in baseball, so he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER as a second-round pick with the ORGANIZATION, who have a long tradition of drafting passers such as PERSON, PERSON Holliday, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZATION produced everywhere he went in his first three pro seasons, batting a combined .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER and leading the high Class A GPE League with NUMBER doubles last year, but his numbers have plummeted in Double-A in NUMBER. PERSON still believes in his offensive upside because he has a smooth left-handed swing with bat speed and loft, generating power to all fields. ORGANIZATION has some feel for hitting and the patience to take walks, but he must make adjustments and cut down on his strikeouts.ORGANIZATION has the tools to be an asset at the hot corner, but he is an erratic defender who has led his league in errors by a third baseman in each of the past two years, including NUMBER in NUMBER. A good athlete with solid arm strength and reliable hands, he gets into trouble with his footwork. He began playing some first base this year because the ORGANIZATION are set at third base with PERSON.",1
"Depending on who was asked, PERSON was the first or second best high school bat in the NUMBER Draft class along with fellow GPE prepster PERSON. PERSON looks the part: tall, athletic and projectable with five-tool potential. A left-handed hitter, PERSON has a smooth swing and a fairly advanced approach at the plate, leading many to believe he'll be at least an above-average hitter in the future. He has room to add strength to his frame, though there was debate over just how much power he'll end up having. PERSON runs very well and has a solid arm in the outfield. One scout not with the ORGANIZATION said he wouldn't be surprised if PERSON ended up being the best player from this Draft class when all was said and done.",0
"PERSON is one of the two pitchers the ORGANIZATION got from the ORGANIZATION, along with shortstop PERSON, in the ORGANIZATION deal. The NUMBER season was the first full one in which PERSON was a full-time starter and he has pitched well in that role, making his Major League debut in June. He has a good three-pitch mix, starting with a plus fastball that can be up to NUMBER mph, and he maintains his velocity deep into starts. His breaking ball sometimes features late bite and it can be an above-average pitch. His changeup is below average right now, and he does have trouble commanding his pitches. That, and a tendency to fall off to the first-base side, has some thinking he might end up going back to a bullpen role, but the pure stuff and stamina make it worth keeping him going as a starter for as long as possible.",1
"The GPE product spent his first full season of pro ball pitching in the bandbox that is PERSON's home stadium and ended up leading the organization in ORGANIZATION and finishing second in batting average against. An advanced college lefty, he could start moving quickly now with a four-pitch mix at his disposal. His fastball is average, but he works it to both sides of the plate effectively, working quickly to throw strike one. His changeup is outstanding, an above-average offspeed pitch with sink. He throws a slider and a curve, with the former a touch better than the latter, and he mixes all his pitches well with a fairly deceptive delivery. His ceiling is limited, but he could fly up the ladder to the big leagues in a hurry now.",0
"A sixth-round Draft pick in NUMBER, PERSON was named the ORGANIZATION of the Year in 'NUMBER after his breakout campaign between Class A Quad Cities and Class A Advanced Lancaster. He was traded once more the following year, this time going to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION Gomez/Mike Fiers deal in GPE, only to spend two weeks on the disabled list in late August with an irritated nerve in his thumb. PERSON' stock continued to slide in NUMBER with a full year in the LOCATION, where he showed good power (NUMBER homers) and speed (NUMBER steals) but also hit just .NUMBER and paced the circuit in strikeouts (NUMBER). Back on track in NUMBER, PERSON made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in early June after an impressive first half in Triple-A.PERSON has a short, compact swing from the left side that produces hard contact across the whole field, though he became too pull-oriented last season and his numbers suffered as a result. He's continued to surprise with his power while climbing the organizational ladder, and there's enough raw power and patience to project average power at maturity. Meanwhile, PERSON' above-average speed makes him a threat on the basepaths, especially if he can reach base at a favorable clip. PERSON' above-average defense is a clean fit in center field, and his cannon arm is more than enough for right field should he be forced off the position. In spite of his disappointing NUMBER campaign. Overall, PERSON' intriguing blend of power, speed and hitting ability could make him a dynamic top-of-the-order hitter, with the floor of a productive fourth outfielder.",1
"Finding college bats with power seems tough to do these days, so when a hitter at a good college program not only has it, but shows he can use it in games, teams will take notice. PERSON was among the nation's leaders in home runs in NUMBER, a breakout season at just the right time.PERSON's power from the right side of the plate is not in question, with home run pop to all fields, and not just in batting practice displays. He has a solid approach at the plate, though some evaluators have concern about his ability to hit better pitching. The biggest worry, though, is about PERSON's throwing arm, which is well below-average. He's played third and the outfield in the past, but it seems like first base, where he's played this spring, is his only future position.Regardless of defensive inadequacies, PERSON has hit in the ORGANIZATION and then carried it over to his junior season. Someone is bound to buy the bat in the top four rounds.",0
"A reliever in NUMBER, PERSON was GPE's No. NUMBER starter in NUMBER when the team finished second in the ORGANIZATION World Series. He began the NUMBER season as the top college lefty in the GPE class, but PERSON's drop in velocity and command issues caused some concern, as did a lat strain that shelved him in April. He returned to help GPE win the series in NUMBER and the ORGANIZATION signed him at the deadline for under pick value because of some medical concerns.PERSON has been up to NUMBER mph in the past, but was sitting around NUMBER-NUMBER mph this spring, with some saying the dip was because he was throwing too many sliders, a plus pitch. The fastball can play up because of its life and angle and his ability to work it to both sides of the plate and he backs it up with that slider and a solid changeup. PERSON usually fills the strike zone, but was nibbling too much leading to an uptick in his walk rate. Even with that and the injury, his track record, arm strength and stuff point to a future as a middle of the rotation type starter.",0
"PERSON improved in each of his three years at ORGANIZATION, earning Big GPE All-Conference honors as a junior. The ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the NUMBERth round that June, signing him for $NUMBER,NUMBER. He's done nothing but produce as a pro, using his blend of hitting ability, speed and defense to move quickly through the ORGANIZATION' system. He was a ORGANIZATION All-Star in his first full season and played just five games at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lakeland at the outset of NUMBER before advancing to Double-A, where he was an LOCATION All-Star and produced a .NUMBER average with NUMBER steals. After the season, PERSON continued to boost his prospect stock with a strong turn in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has a good feel for what he's doing at the plate. His approach is geared toward hitting the ball back up the middle, and he does so often using a short left-handed swing. While PERSON's contact is mostly of the ground-ball variety, it actually plays into his strength because he's a plus-plus runner with well-below-average power. PERSON is a skilled bunter, with the ability to lay it down either line, and he's an aggressive, sometimes over-aggressive basestealer. He fared better against same-sided arms (.NUMBER average) than righties (.NUMBER) in Double-A. PERSON's wheels enable him to play center field, and he's seen significant time at all three outfield spots in full-season ball. That versatility, along with his speed and bat, give PERSON a clear path to the Majors as a fourth outfielder.",0
"The ORGANIZATION of the NUMBER Under PERSON All-America Game at FACILITY, PERSON was one of the best two-way talents available in last year's Draft.

Add in his bat speed and strength, and he has the potential to develop into a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER homers per season. He's an average runner with good instincts on the bases.He broke into pro ball as a center fielder but probably will wind up in right field.

Control issues during his first full season moved him back to the bullpen.PERSON started as a sophomore at GPE, though he served as GPE's closer in his Draft year en route to the ORGANIZATION World Series. He does have the stuff to potentially be a starter long-term and be a middle-of-the rotation type in the future. His fastball and slider alone are enough to get hitters out, with both having plus potential, especially in shorter stints. As a starter, he's more likely to sit in the low NUMBERs. PERSON has some feel for a changeup, but obviously didn't throw it much as a closer. PERSON has shown a smooth delivery and solid command in the past. If he can rediscover that, he still has the ability to start, though a permanent move to the pen could allow him to move more quickly.",0
"When evaluating where PERSON is on the development path, it's important to note that GPE is not a very nice place to hit. Just ask PERSON, who hit zero homers in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League at age NUMBER. PERSON, the Wyoming native who didn't have a high school baseball team, hit six as a raw teenager. There's a lot of raw power to tap into for PERSON and as he continues to refine his approach, he should have at least above-average pop in games. He does understand the strike zone quite well, so he should hit for average as well. A solid average runner, PERSON has a good arm and while he has work to do to stay in center field, should be an average defender across the board. The ORGANIZATION knew it might take PERSON some time to develop given his experience, but in many ways he's ahead of the curve.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON had hamstring issues during his senior year of high school in GPE, forcing him to miss the season, which led to him being available in the second round at pick No. NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION' first selection in the NUMBER Draft. The problems persisted that summer and into NUMBER, limiting the talented outfielder to just NUMBER at-bats over two summers. In NUMBER he avoided leg injuries, but an elbow problem ended his season in July with ulnar nerve surgery and he spent time on the disabled list again in NUMBER.The good news is that despite all the missed time, PERSON still shows solid tools at the plate. Trouble seeing the ball led to a rough start during his first taste of full-season ball in NUMBER, but after that was addressed with a new prescription, he started to hit for average and power before his season ended, though that didn't carry over to the following season. He can drive the ball to all fields and will draw walks, albeit with a fairly high strikeout rate, though that improved with the sight adjustment. He still runs well, despite the leg issues, and while he was hesitant because of the injuries, he might get the green light more moving forward on the basepaths and it allows him to cover a lot of ground and play a solid center field. His arm is fine for center, but he'd likely have to move to left should he slow down.The first order of business is for PERSON to get a full season of reps in on both sides of the ball so he can continue refining his approach at the plate as well as his reads and routes in the outfield. If he can do that, then it might be easier to project his upside.",0
"It's the job of every scouting department to uncover talent. It's unusual, however, for ORGANIZATION-eligible talent to be found after the ORGANIZATION has been completed. That's exactly what happened with Nevada-Reno outfielder TJ PERSON. It ended up being the gain of the ORGANIZATION, who signed the passed-over player for $NUMBER,NUMBER.No one, including PERSON himself, realized the speedy outfielder was eligible for the NUMBER ORGANIZATION as a redshirt sophomore. PERSON started to get wind of it as PERSON was trying out and then playing for the ORGANIZATION. Several teams other than the ORGANIZATION showed interest, most notably the ORGANIZATION and PERSON. But it was the ORGANIZATION who were able to sign him. PERSON played very well for PERSON in international competition, with some feeling he was the second-best position player on the team, behind PERSON's PERSON, who will be a hot commodity in next year's ORGANIZATION. PERSON has plus speed, which helps him steal bases and cover a lot of ground defensively. He played a corner spot in deference to Kendall on PERSON, but he is a center fielder long-term. With a good approach at the plate and a line-drive, gap swing from the left side, the ORGANIZATION might have a future leadoff hitter on their hands.",0
"A NUMBERth-round Draft pick in NUMBER out of GPE (Calif.) High, PERSON made developmental strides in NUMBER after a successful full-season debut the previous year. He was named co-Pitcher of the Year of the ORGANIZATION State League and led all Minor League pitchers in wins, also ranking third in both ORGANIZATION and strikeouts. He was added to the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER-man roster after the season. PERSON and projectable when he was drafted, the NUMBER-foot-NUMBER righty has matured physically in the past year and repeats his delivery more consistently as a result. PERSON creates excellent plane toward the plate and works down in the zone with his fastball, which jumped into the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range in NUMBER. His command of the pitch lags behind its velocity right now, though the former stands to improve given his athleticism and easy delivery. PERSON's NUMBER-to-NUMBER curveball is a work in progress and projects as slightly below average, but he can throw it for a strike and mix it effectively. His changeup in the mid NUMBERs flashes plus and is thrown from the same slot as his fastball with similar arm speed. It's a weapon against both right- and left-handed hitters. PERSON made a name for himself in NUMBER, and the ORGANIZATION believe there's more to come from the NUMBER-year-old. He has the potential to become a No. NUMBER starter with better fastball command and a sharper curveball, while his plus fastball-changeup combo also gives him upside in either a seventh- or eighth-inning role.",0
"It doesn't happen often for a college hitter to go through a season hitting over .NUMBER and not be noticed or taken in the GPE. That's because most didn't realize PERSON was a GPE-eligible sophomore at Nevada-Reno until after the GPE. He was playing well for the GPE National Collegiate Team when a bidding war of sorts ensued, won by the ORGANIZATION, who gave him $NUMBER,NUMBER to sign. PERSON hit well in the ORGANIZATION (.NUMBER OPS) during his first full season, then fizzled a bit after a promotion to the ORGANIZATION State League.PERSON has a good idea of what he wants to do at the plate, with a contact-oriented approach. He puts the ball in play, sending line drives to the gaps without striking out much and drawing a decent amount of walks. While he's never going to be a huge home run guy, he does have a little sneaky pop and might run into a few homers. His plus speed works on both sides of the ball, allowing him to take an extra base as well as steal a few of them. It also plays well in the outfield. He's seen time in all three outfield spots, but he's better suited in center or left because of his fringy arm.In all likelihood, PERSON will fit the fourth outfielder mold really well. If his bat comes around a little bit more, he could be an everyday outfielder, though it would have to be in center since he doesn't fit the offensive profile for a corner spot.",0
"PERSON didn't pitch as a sophomore at ORGANIZATION (GPE) JC, then transferred to PERSON and set the ORGANIZATION' single-season (NUMBER) and career (NUMBER) saves records, surpassing current Pirates shortstop PERSON in the latter category. A $NUMBER,NUMBER senior sign by the Athletics in the NUMBERnd round of the NUMBER Draft, PERSON recorded a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his first two years as a pro and saved NUMBER games in his first full season while reaching Double-A. He reached Triple-A in his first year in the ORGANIZATION' system after being acquired in a trade for PERSON, but he drew a NUMBER-game suspension in the offseason after testing positive for a stimulant.PERSON may be small (NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER pounds) and possess below-average fastball velocity, but he is effective because he's extremely deceptive, mixes four pitches and locates them where he wants. His fastball maxes out at NUMBER mph, but hitters don't punish it because it features good life and he works it to both sides of the plate and down in the strike zone. His best offering is his solid curveball, and he also can get swings and misses with his average slider and changeup.Throwing from a variety of arm slots to keep hitters off-balance, PERSON has dominated left-handers as well as right-handers. He's a good bet to become at least a middle reliever in the big leagues and could ascend to that role in NUMBER.",0
"PERSON played mostly third base on PERSON last summer, while PERSON was at second and PERSON played shortstop. All three project as shortstops in pro ball and they may all go in the first round. PERSON is small and has toned down his swing a bit this spring to focus more on contact, but it's stilla  bit funky, relying more on his standout quickness and instincts in all phases of the game.",0
"PERSON blew out his elbow as a ORGANIZATION high school senior in NUMBER, causing him to miss his first season at LOCATION. He continued to battle injuries in his first two years on the ORGANIZATION staff, then showed enough as a redshirt junior in NUMBER for the ORGANIZATION to sign him for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERnd-rounder. After working as a swingman in NUMBER, he has taken off this year as a late-inning reliever.PERSON worked in the low NUMBERs as a college starter but now operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reaches triple digits with his fastball. Hitters can't afford to sit on his heater because he also has a hard breaking ball that can reach the upper NUMBERs, pairing slider velocity with curveball depth. He also has a splitter but doesn't use it very often.The biggest issue with PERSON is his ability to harness his improved stuff. Despite a relatively easy delivery, he didn't throw a lot of strikes in college and hasn't as a pro. His ability to do so will determine whether he can be trusted with high-leverage situations in the big leagues.",0
"A late bloomer in high school, ORGANIZATION opted for GPE instead of the ORGANIZATION, who had taken him in the NUMBERth round in NUMBER. PERSON surgery wiped out his freshman year, but he came back and pitched well as the ORGANIZATION' Saturday starter. ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION stock surged as ORGANIZATION's ace during the spring, as he ranked second in the nation in strikeouts per nine innings (NUMBER.NUMBER) and garnered honors as one of NUMBER players named to ORGANIZATION. A regression in command cost him some traction late in the spring, but he still received a slightly above-slot bonus of $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER from PERSON after it selected him with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. Perhaps the hardest thrower among college hurlers in his class, ORGANIZATION consistently touched triple digits with his fastball during the spring while sitting at NUMBER-NUMBER on a regular basis. The left-hander complements his dynamic heater with a plus changeup, a pitch he throws with good arm speed that features a ton of late drop to it. ORGANIZATION's slider gives him a third at least average pitch.While ORGANIZATION's strikeout rate has been really high, his walk rate has been as well. That, plus a delivery that features a fairly big recoil, has led some evaluators to project him as a future reliever -- albeit one who could get to the big leagues in a hurry. But with a loose and very athletic frame, ORGANIZATION might be able to get away with those mechanics. He's elicited some PERSON comps, with some scouts thinking he has better stuff now, at least with the fastball, than PERSON did in his ORGANIZATION year.",0
"PERSON was one of the hottest players in college baseball early in NUMBER, hitting .NUMBER through NUMBER games at ORGANIZATION before an errant pitch injured his right hand. Signed by the ORGANIZATION for a slightly under-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER as a second-round pick, he ranked third in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in batting (.NUMBER) and on-base percentage (.NUMBER) during his pro debut, then finished second (.NUMBER) and first (.NUMBER) in those categories in the Class A Advanced PERSON in NUMBER before finishing his first full season with a strong month in Double-A. It now will be up to the ORGANIZATION to further PERSON's development after they acquired him and left-hander PERSON in February as part of a three-team trade with PERSON. PERSON has a long track record of hitting and getting on base. His right-handed swing is geared for stroking line drives from gap to gap, an approach that results in consistent contact but doesn't provide much power. He has the solid speed to beat out ground balls and the instincts to steal some bases.After DHing as a freshman and playing mostly the outfield corners as a sophomore, PERSON shifted to second base last spring. He has the quickness and reliable hands for the position, though he doesn't have the smoothest actions and some scouts believe he's destined for center field. The ORGANIZATION loved his gamer makeup and his work ethic, qualities that the ORGANIZATION also have been known to covet.",0
"As a high schooler, PERSON earned comparisons to PERSON because both were GPE prepsters with similar offensive and defensive projections at the same stage of their careers. They were drafted in the same area, with PERSON the ORGANIZATION' second-rounder in NUMBER and PERSON landing an over-slot $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus as a ORGANIZATION third-rounder in NUMBER. While PERSON immediately hit in pro ball, PERSON didn't get going at the plate until repeating high Class A this year.PERSON has a nice right-handed swing and finally is starting to sting the ball with more authority as he has added some strength and experience. He has made strides with his approach and his pitch recognition, though he still could use more patience. With his strong wrists and above-average speed, he has the upside to reach double figures in both homers and steals.Also like PERSON, PERSON was drafted as a shortstop but ticketed for second base in the long run. While his below-average arm limits his effectiveness on the left side of the infield, he has the quickness and hands to be a solid defender at second. Just as he has at the plate, he has gotten more consistent in the field with more exposure to pro ball.",0
"He can't match PERSON's loud tools or his ceiling, but PERSON outhit him on the same teams in NUMBER and NUMBER. Though he won't displace PERSON as the ORGANIZATION' shortstop of the future, PERSON has enough all-around ability to claim a utility role in GPE. His play in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER earned him a spot on the NUMBER-man roster, and he has kept it heading into NUMBER.A switch-hitter, PERSON has tremendous hand-eye coordination that makes him one of the best contact hitters in the system. He drives the ball more from the right side of the plate, but he isn't a power threat by any means, and he'll likely will fit at the bottom of a big league batting order. PERSON is an average runner who won't steal many bases.While he may make only modest offensive contributions, PERSON' defensive versatility enhances his value. He has the range and arm strength to be a solid shortstop. At second base, he's a plus defender with quick hands made for turning double plays, and he also can get the job done at the hot corner.",0
"PERSON rewrote the FACILITY (ORGANIZATION) record books in NUMBER, setting marks at the ORGANIZATION II program for hitting (.NUMBER), on-base percentage (.NUMBER), slugging (.NUMBER) and homers (NUMBER). He also became the highest-drafted player in GPE history, surpassing PERSON, and signed with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a seventh-rounder. He has handled a jump to Class A Advanced well during his first full pro season.A left-handed hitter, PERSON projects to hit more for average than power. He does have some strength in his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound frame and a knack for driving the ball to the gaps, so he'll collect his share of doubles and should be able to produce double-digit home run totals. An average runner out of the batter's box and quicker once he gets going, he's aggressive on the bases.After playing center field at FACILITY, PERSON has spent most of his career on the outfield corners while also seeing time at first base. An average defender in left and right field, he has solid arm strength and makes accurate throws.",0
"PERSON chose to move back to his native PERSON rather than fulfill his senior year at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Fla.). It proved a wise move, as ORGANIZATION ruled him an international free agent in April NUMBER, and he signed with the ORGANIZATION on his NUMBERth birthday three months later for $NUMBER million, a record bonus for a non-Cuban international amateur. PERSON struggled during his pro debut at ORGANIZATION A Augusta, albeit after an NUMBER-month layoff from game action, and the ORGANIZATION shipped him to PERSON with right-handed pitcher PERSON and big leaguer PERSON for PERSON at the NUMBER PERSON. It was learned that he had been playing through a foot injury, and the ORGANIZATION shut him down for the remainder of the season. PERSON healthy in NUMBER, PERSON made his ORGANIZATION debut with PERSON before a late-season promotion to the ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON. Along the way, he represented the World Team in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON Game.PERSON is a top-flight athlete with plus-plus speed and three more tools that should be at least solid. The switch-hitter profiles as a future leadoff-type hitter, as he employs a solid approach, produces line-drive contact from both sides of the plate and knows how to use his impressive wheels once on base. PERSON won't offer much in the way of over-the-fence power, but he does have some strength and can drive some balls to the gaps, making him a source of doubles and triples. PERSON's range, quick hands and arm fit easily at shortstop, though, like any young shortstop, he needs to fine-tune his game and learn the nuances of the position. Some scouts don't love his middle-infield actions and think he'll fit better in center field, though the Ray believe he can stay at short, lauding his super athleticism and ability to learn quickly.",0
"After a certain point in time, when a prospect continually outperforms his tools, you have to start believing it's legit. While PERSON was just a ninth-round pick in NUMBER after an injury-interrupted junior year at GPE, he just keeps on producing, including an All-Star turn in the Double-A LOCATION in NUMBER. He was playing well in the ORGANIZATION to cap off his year when he suffered a concussion in an outfield collision, though he is expected to be NUMBER percent for NUMBER.PERSON is a bit underrated because he doesn't have one tool that jumps off the page. His biggest skill is his ability to control the strike zone and he's walked more than he's struck out in his pro career. That plus some solid bat speed has led to hitting for a high average. He hasn't hit a ton of homers, but there is some pop from the left side and the ORGANIZATION think he might be able to leverage the baseball a little more to tap into that raw power. He has decent speed and has shown the ability to play all three outfield spots.If the extra-base ability comes around a bit more as he's knocking on the big league door, he could end up surprising people and becoming an everyday guy, best suited for left field. Even if he doesn't, a solid career as a productive fourth outfielder awaits.",0
"Only eight high school second basemen have been drafted in the first or supplemental first round, the last of whom was ORGANIZATION, who signed for $NUMBER million as the NUMBERth overall pick in NUMBER. His hitting ability and speed were rated among the best in his prep class, though neither tool has quite made the impact in pro ball that was expected. The ORGANIZATION hoped he would take off when he moved from second base to center field while repeating high Class A last year, but his season ended in early May when he dislocated his left shoulder diving for a ball. PERSON healthy in NUMBER, ORGANIZATION reached Double-A for the first time in May and became property of the ORGANIZATION two months later when the ORGANIZATION packaged him with PERSON and a PTBNL in a deal for reliever PERSON. A left-handed hitter, ORGANIZATION makes consistent contact and delivers line drives to all fields. He hasn't shown much extra-base power yet, though PERSON still believes he can produce double-digit homer totals as he continues to add strength. His speed earned some double-plus grades when he was an amateur, but it's more plus now and he still has much to learn as a basestealer.ORGANIZATION tore the labrum in his throwing shoulder in high school, leaving him with a below-average arm that was a liability at second base. He also led GPE League second basemen with NUMBER errors in NUMBER, prompting the ORGANIZATION to try him in center field in instructional league and make him a regular outfielder last year. His arm restricts his versatility, with left field his only other option.",0
"GPE' best high school pitching prospect since the ORGANIZATION made PERSON a first-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON is an extremely athletic and projectable left-hander whose stock continues to improve as the ORGANIZATION approaches. He's a safe bet to go in the top three rounds, with some talk that he could become a supplemental first-rounder.PERSON's best pitch is a NUMBER-NUMBER mph curveball with good depth that should add even more power once he adds strength to his skinny NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. He commands his breaking ball well, though he relies on it too often.The Missouri recruit usually pitches at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and tops out around NUMBER with his fastball. With his arm action and projection, it won't be a surprise if he reaches the mid-NUMBERs in the future. He shows the makings of a changeup, though he doesn't trust it yet and doesn't need it much against high school competition.",0
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER.NUMBER million in July NUMBER, PERSON put himself on the map in NUMBER when he paced the Short-Season Northwest League in most offensive categories. During the offseason, he became the key return for GPE in the trade that sent NUMBER ORGANIZATION MVP Josh Donaldson to GPE. PERSON bypassed the Class A level entirely upon joining the A's system, making the jump directly to the Class A Advanced California League for his full-season debut. He thrived at the plate despite ranking as the league's second-youngest regular, only to have his season end prematurely in late July when he landed on the disabled list with a wrist contusion. He fully recovered from the injury in time for the NUMBER season, which he began at ORGANIZATION. PERSON stands out for his combination of hitting ability and raw power. He's undersized at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, but he possesses a lightning-quick bat and explosive swing, and his feel for using the whole field at a young age suggests he'll hit for a high average. PERSON's approach is overly aggressive but doesn't result in too much swing-and-miss, a testament to his excellent contact skills. He is no worse than an average runner and runs the bases well, though his stolen-base totals likely will be tied to his ability to get on base.PERSON's defense at shortstop lags well behind his bat at this point in his career, a notion supported by a career-worst NUMBER errors in NUMBER games at the position in NUMBER. He has good range as well as a plus arm, but his actions are inconsistent and he struggles to control his body while on the move. PERSON will have every opportunity to prove he can stick at shortstop, but the bat could make him an impact player even if he's forced to second or third base.",1
"GPE love what they see in PERSON, who is NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and nearly NUMBER pounds. They also love that he makes the game look easy because of his natural abilities. He's smooth.Overall, PERSON is lean, athletic and full of energy. The middle infielder has also shown the type of speed that could land him at the top of the order one day. He has a good hitting approach and is considered a line-drive hitter. He has some power and has displayed the ability to hit the ball into the gaps on a consistent basis.On defense, PERSON profiles as an everyday shortstop if he continues to develop as expected. He has smooth defensive actions and an arm strong enough to keep him at the position.PERSON is from GPE, ORGANIZATION signed a $NUMBER.NUMBER million deal with the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON signed at NUMBER and had been slow to develop (parts of NUMBER seasons in the ORGANIZATION) until NUMBER, when he skipped a level, then earned a mid-year promotion to Hi-A. He throws hard -- NUMBER-NUMBER with huge extension -- and his fastball has relevant movement up and away from lefty batters. He's well built but not very athletic, and he throws many non-competitive pitches because he struggles to repeat. Rule NUMBER eligible this winter, PERSON has relief potential because of his heater.",0
"PERSON spent almost all of his first three pro seasons in GPE ball after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. He led PERSON's all-prospect rotation with NUMBER victories and led the entire system with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in NUMBER, when he also won the decisive game of the low Class A ORGANIZATION playoffs.Though he has a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that touches NUMBER, PERSON is more about efficiency than overpowering hitters. He fills the strike zone and gets a lot of groundouts with the sink on his heater, but he doesn't miss a lot of bats.That may change if PERSON' slider continues to improve and can keep opponents from sitting on his fastball. He has yet to demonstrate much feel for a changeup, a shortcoming that eventually could lead him to the bullpen.",0
"GPE received the highest bonus in the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER international crop, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION. He pitched a career-low NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings last year, the result of a NUMBER-game suspension for testing positive for stimulants and a bout with shoulder tendinitis, but pitched well enough in Double-A and the ORGANIZATION to earn a spot on PERSON's NUMBER-man roster. GPE earned a midseason promotion to Triple-A then was acquired by the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in late July.GPE often pitches in the low NUMBERs and tops out at NUMBER with sink and tail on his fastball, though at times he'll dip down to the upper NUMBERs. His slider and changeup can be solid pitches on occasion, and he has the aptitude to vary the break on his slider. He also can mix in a curveball for show. There isn't much effort in GPE's delivery, and he's doing a better job of repeating it and maintaining the quality of his stuff and command. He'll need to watch his conditioning because his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame carries a lot more than his listed NUMBER pounds. He most likely will fit in the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER slot in a big league rotation.",1
"Signed back in NUMBER as a soft-tossing lefty, PERSON took a while to develop, spending three seasons in the ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in NUMBER. He's jumped more firmly on the radar in NUMBER, making his full-season debut and earning a promotion up a level in the process. PERSON has always had an above-average feel for pitching. His leap forward in NUMBER comes courtesy of an uptick of stuff. He will now throw his fastball in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. He backs it up with one of the best changeups in the system, thrown NUMBER-NUMBER mph, and a solid NUMBER-NUMBER mph slider. He commands all three pitches well. With the improved stuff, PERSON has become a legitimate starting pitching prospect. The Phillies have a number of intriguing lefties in the system and an argument could be made that PERSON is close to being at the top of that list.",1
"Pirates fans who are eagerly anticipating the arrival of the one-two punch of GPE and PERSON shouldn't have to wait too much longer. The big right-hander who came from the GPE high school ranks finished the season in Double-A, with three outstanding starts to finish the year. His fastball is a plus pitch and he'll touch NUMBER-NUMBER mph with it. PERSON's secondary stuff is still developing, but both his breaking ball and offspeed offering have the chance to be above-average pitches. He gained more confidence in his curve as the year went on and he showed better feel for his changeup as well. PERSON is still growing into his body and tweaking his delivery, leading to some overall command issues, though that shouldn't be a long-term concern. Another year of experience under his belt might be all he needs to be ready for ORGANIZATION.",0
"The ORGANIZATION continued PeÃ±a's development as a starter last year even though his wildness will likely relegate him to the bullpen eventually. His low-NUMBERs fastball plays up because his gargantuan stride creates big extension and two extra ticks of perceived velo. So extreme is PeÃ±a's leap off the mound that it appears to detract from his command because it's so hard to harness. His slider and changeup both flash plus, and he arbuably has better feel for locating either of those than his fastball. He has No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter stuff, but issues with fastball location make him too inefficient to start. He reached Triple-A last year but struggled, and was passed over in the Rule NUMBER; he's a candidate to bounce back.",0
"After drafting right-hander PERSON in the first round in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION took PERSON, another polished college pitcher, in the second round. As they did with PERSON, the ORGANIZATION challenged PERSON during his professional debut, and he handled the assignment to Class A Lakewood well. He made just two starts at the next level to start the NUMBER season before a shoulder problem landed him on the disabled list, though he did return two months later.PERSON has a solid three-pitch mix and a good feel for pitching. He throws his fastball in the upper NUMBERs to low NUMBERs. The pitch plays up, thanks to its natural cutting action and the downhill angle he throws from. His breaking ball can be an out pitch, and he also mixes in a changeup. Though PERSON doesn't have premium stuff, he was one of the top strikeout pitchers in the country as a junior at ORGANIZATION. If he can rediscover that success in the ORGANIZATION, he could start advancing quickly.",0

His fastball operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with good riding life, and it pairs nicely with a curveball that will flash above average with good shape and improving depth. PERSON' changeup plays firm, but is effective against left-handed hitters, and he'll also mix in a slider. Though physically mature, PERSON does a good job of repeating his delivery, enabling him to be around the zone consistently with all four pitches. He doesn't require much projection, but the ingredients are there for the right-hander to develop into a back-of-the-rotation piece.",0
"The PERSON didn't spend lavishly during the NUMBER international signing period, but they picked their spots well and signed one of the top third basemen in the class in PERSON. He skipped over the ORGANIZATION, beginning his professional career in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER.  PERSON stands out for his powerful right-handed bat. He squares the ball up well and has good strike-zone discipline for his age.  At NUMBER, PERSON is already listed at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER pounds, and his size may necessitate a position change. He's a below-average runner, but he could possibly be a fit in the outfield or at first base. No matter where PERSON plays, his powerful bat will be what propels him through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"One of the top shortstop prospects in the NUMBER international class, PERSON reportedly reached an agreement with the ORGANIZATION on a $NUMBER.NUMBER signing bonus, but the deal never came to fruition, ultimately allowing the ORGANIZATION to land the then-NUMBER-year-old for $NUMBER,NUMBER. The switch-hitting shortstop is more advanced as a left-handed hitter and has a cleaner swing from that side, showing the ability to drive the ball to the opposite field. PERSON' power could increase as develops physically, and his contact skills and above-average speed should net him plenty of doubles and triples. Meanwhile, his plate discipline proved to be more advanced than expected during his NUMBER professional debut in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON stands out at shortstop for his range and plus arm strength, but his actions will require refinement in the coming years. He also receives high praise for his intensity and leadership qualities at the position. Should PERSON not be able to stick at the position, his skill sets would also be a fit at second base. After his successful pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON could be ready for his taste of stateside action in NUMBER.",0
"PERSON was a raw, toolsy catcher when he was a high schooler in GPE. The level of competition he faced and opposing pitchers' predilection to pitching around him made it difficult for teams to scout PERSON and he wound up in college. He blossomed as an outfielder PERSON, breaking out in the ORGANIZATION in the summer of NUMBER. PERSON remains relatively raw and toolsy and some scouts wonder if he will be able to adjust to more advanced pitching, though he performed extremely well in the ORGANIZATION as a junior. PERSON creates good bat speed and has plenty of raw power, which he will tap into the more he can improve his approach. PERSON has average speed and is faster once he's under way. He has a strong arm and profiles as a potential five-tool right fielder.",0
"It's often said that the jump to Double-A is what separates a prospect, and seeing a player duplicate success once out of the hitting-friendly GPE League and in the much more pitching favorable LOCATION is a very good sign. If that's the case, then the D-backs have a very good prospect on their hands here in GPE handled the jump more than capably. He was named to the ORGANIZATION and the LOCATION All-Star Team, was tabbed as the organization's ORGANIZATION of the Year and made his big league debut. PERSON's hit tool keeps improving and he's cut his strikeout rate three years in a row. He has strength and power to come as he continues to refine his approach. PERSON has excellent speed which plays on both sides of the ball, and he hasn't lost any of it as he's gotten stronger. He covers a ton of ground and continues to get better on his reads and routes in center, while also having the plus arm teams covet for right field.PERSON is as tooled out as any offensive player in the D-backs' system, and he seems to be figuring out how to use those tools on a consistent basis, giving him the chance to be a big league regular.",1
"PERSON, a former GPE ORGANIZATION star, spent his first full professional season with PERSON. Though he remains somewhat raw, his big arm and prototypical starter's build entice scouts. Having made it up to Double-A in NUMBER, he clearly intrigued the ORGANIZATION, who got him from the Nationals in return for PERSON just prior to the non-waiver Trading Deadline.There's still some projection left for PERSON, and he could end up pitching with a tick more velocity than he has now. His fastball typically sits in the low NUMBERs, occasionally reaching NUMBER mph. His secondary stuff is still inconsistent, but he has the makings of a solid curveball and changeup. He's still learning to consistently repeat his delivery, but at his best he fills up the strike zone with all his pitches. PERSON is far from a finished product, but he has the upside to develop into a Major League starter in time.",0
"Injuries limited PERSON to NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION State Northridge, but he showed enough as a junior to merit a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus as a NUMBERrd-rounder in the NUMBER Draft. He opened eyes with a spectacular NUMBER-NUMBER K-BB ratio in the Rookie-level PERSON in NUMBER and held his own following a promotion to high Class A in August.PERSON combines velocity and command in his well-above-average fastball, which usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and can reach NUMBER. His curveball and changeup give him a pair of effective secondary pitches. PERSON repeats his delivery well, throws strikes and can locate his fastball to both sides of the plate and down in the zone. If he can stay healthy, he could blossom into a middle-of-the-rotation option.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON enjoyed a pair of successful seasons in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION before making the jump to the GPE in NUMBER. While it was obvious that he still has a ways to go to harness his stuff, his strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER) would have topped the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League if he had pitched enough innings to qualify.PERSON's fastball usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reaches NUMBER with some late life. His secondary pitches are works in progress, with the most promising a curveball that shows good depth at times and has the potential to become a solid offering.PERSON's changeup needs significant work, and his control and command require even more refinement. There's some effort in his delivery and he doesn't repeat it consistently, which hampers his ability to throw strikes. If he can't make the improvements needed to become a starter, he could become an effective lefty reliever.",0
"A.J. PERSON might have been the more ""famous"" ORGANIZATION of GPE starter, but it was PERSON who was the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter for all three years of his college career. He was named the NUMBER ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year after going NUMBER-NUMBER with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in NUMBER starts. The A's ended up adding both GPE hurlers to its system day one of the draft, selecting PERSON in the first round and PERSON in the second. PERSON and durable, PERSON is a strike-throwing machine with a potential three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise, but it plays up because of his command. His best pitch is his changeup, which he locates and sinks extremely well. Even when hitters know it's coming, he still gets outs. PERSON's breaking ball is slurvy and a bit inconsistent. When it's on, however, it can be virtually unhittable and has the potential of being a third Major League average offering.Though he's more about pitchability than stuff, PERSON's track record in the ultra-competitive ORGANIZATION speaks for itself. The lack of an explosive fastball limits his ceiling, but there's certainly a lot to like in a college performer who should be quick to the big leagues as a back-end starter.",0
"PERSON was seen as a decent high school prospect heading into his senior year of high school when he took PERSON deep at the ORGANIZATION Invitational at the ORGANIZATION complex in March NUMBER. That helped him to climb into the third round and the ORGANIZATION were able to keep him from attending the ORGANIZATION of GPE. A solid defender with good speed, PERSON has a decent feel for the game and good instincts, though it remains to be seen if he'll stay at short. He had a solid summer debut that included a brief stop with full-season Delmarva. If he can improve his approach at the plate and on-base skills, he could be a future top-of-the-order type hitter.",0
"A raw, arm strength goon for what seemed like forever, PERSON found slider feel late last season and had dominant stretches where he looked like a potential closer. He has carried that into the early part of this season, more frequently dotting his slider just off the plate to his glove side and even getting it over for strikes when he's behind in counts. PERSON still just kind of chucks his fastball and hopes it arrives near the plate, but he's going to get away with mistakes in the zone because of the velocity. Likely to have harrowing bouts of wildness, PERSON has high-leverage/closer stuff and could be one of the better relief pitchers in baseball at some point, though he may already be in his late-NUMBERs once things really click.",0
"Just the fifth first-rounder in GPE Dame history, PERSON went NUMBERth overall in June NUMBER and signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION hadn't taken a college position player in the first round since going for John-Ford Griffin in NUMBER, but they couldn't ignore that PERSON's left-handed power was tailor-made for ORGANIZATION Stadium.PERSON showed an ability to drive the ball to all fields when he finished second in the ORGANIZATION with NUMBER homers in the summer of NUMBER, and he continued to do so while going deep six times in his pro debut. He has matured as a hitter in the past year, displaying more patience at the plate.PERSON has improved defensively, too. While he won't be a ORGANIZATION, he should be able to stick at third base, and he definitely has the arm strength for the position.",0
"The LOCATION freshman of the year and batting champion (.NUMBER) in NUMBER, PERSON hasn't quite matched that production since but has continued to catalyze PERSON's lineup the last two years. PERSON-eligible as a NUMBER-year-old sophomore in NUMBER, he turned down the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-round pick, lasting that long only because of questionable signability. He may have the best football family in this year's PERSON, as his grandfather PERSON, father PERSON and uncle Kris all played professionally.PERSON's best tool is his speed, which grades as plus-plus out of the batter's box but doesn't play quite that fast and hasn't translated into elite basestealing or defensive ability. A switch-hitter, he concentrates on making contact and getting on base, an approach that leaves him with almost no power. He's doing a better job of working counts and drawing walks as a junior, though he still needs more patience to become a true tablesetter.PERSON also has improved his jumps and reads this year, making him a solid defender in center field. He has a stronger arm than most players at his position, having reached NUMBER mph with his fastball when he started five games on the mound as a sophomore. He proved his grit by playing through a broken left hand for much of last season.",0
"It's been a good year to go see talented high school arms in the LOCATION, with ORGANIZATION keeping up with PERSON in GPE and PERSON in GPE as the top prep pitchers in the region.While slightly less projectable than his counterparts, the ORGANIZATION commit performed well this spring. Even though it's just his second full year of pitching, ORGANIZATION is more advanced than many, with more consistent pitchability. He'll pitch at NUMBER-NUMBER mph, but can reach back for NUMBER mph when he needs it. His curveball shows flashes of being a plus offering, and his changeup gives him the chance to have a very effective three-pitch mix. He can throw all three pitches for strikes .A fresh arm in a durable frame is an intriguing combination. While ORGANIZATION may not have the ceiling of some high school pitchers in this class, his stuff and poise should interest many teams in the first few rounds.",0
"While at ORGANIZATION State-Fullerton, PERSON was an everyday center fielder who closed on the mound. Now he's a pitcher only, and the Reds are developing him as a starter.PERSON will be a bit of a project as a starter, but he has the arm strength and raw stuff to potentially get there. He can run his fastball up into the upper-NUMBERs in shorter stints, and it has good movement to it. PERSON's breaking ball has the chance to be average, and his previously seldom-used changeup could give him a viable third pitch. His outstanding athleticism -- he was a terrific defensive center fielder -- should help him learn to repeat his delivery and improve his overall command.Joe Kelly of the ORGANIZATION was a college closer and has developed into a solid starter, a path PERSON hopes PERSON takes, knowing he could be a lights-out closer if starting doesn't work out.",1
"The son of PERSON, who won two World Series rings with the ORGANIZATION and played in the NUMBER Olympics for GPE, PERSON went in the fourth round of the NUMBER PERSON. He landed a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus, making him the biggest over-slot signing in the ORGANIZATION' PERSON class that year. He struggled in his pro debut but improved his OPS from .NUMBER to .NUMBER in his second shot at ORGANIZATION ball.PERSON has a sweet left-handed swing that should allow him to produce solid batting averages. He has power potential, too, though he'll need to add weight to his lanky NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame to translate it into home runs. He already has put on NUMBER pounds since turning pro.Scouts rave about PERSON's instincts and makeup. He moves well for his size and has soft hands at first base, where he should be an above-average defender. He has some arm strength, too, as he was routinely clocked in the upper NUMBERs as a high school pitcher.",0
"A subpar senior season hurt PERSON' PERSON stock in NUMBER and the ORGANIZATION went over-slot to sign the ORGANIZATION product. He had a solid pro debut in NUMBER, getting the chance to play at two levels and displaying some of the offensive skills that made him a prospect before his senior swoon. PERSON has the chance to be a solid offensive-minded middle infielder with good bat speed and some power. His hands and feet work well in the infield, but his fringy speed affects his range, meaning second base might be a better long-term home. That's where he played most of his games during his debut, so the ORGANIZATION might agree with that assessment.",0
"The compensation pick the ORGANIZATION received for losing PERSON to free agency, PERSON signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as the NUMBERth overall pick in NUMBER. He went deep in his first pro at-bat and led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with NUMBER homers as a NUMBER-year-old in his first full season, but his encore was disappointing. PERSON hit five homers in two months in the ORGANIZATION before drawing an NUMBER-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. While challenging for the ORGANIZATION home run lead in NUMBER, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON and PERSON has much more power than the typical second baseman, generating it with bat speed and backspin from the right side of the plate. He shows some ability to draw the walks and use the whole field, but he's too aggressive at the plate. PERSON struck out in NUMBER percent of his plate appearances over his first three pro seasons, in large part because he's still figuring out how to deal with breaking pitches.A shortstop in high school, PERSON has a strong arm and average speed that many scouts thought would fit best at third base. With PERSON and PERSON at third base, the ORGANIZATION moved him to second base in NUMBER. PERSON had adapted well to his new position and should become at least an average defender there. Now without those obstacles, but the possibility of PERSON playing second for a long time, the ORGANIZATION might consider giving PERSON a look at the hot corner.",0
"The ORGANIZATION knew when they drafted PERSON, a GSP high school product, that it might take him a while to develop, as is often the case for prep pitchers from the LOCATION. PERSON has improved from year-to-year and could be ready to make a big leap in the near future.PERSON has big, raw stuff, starting with his sinking fastball which averaged NUMBER mph in NUMBER and ranged anywhere from NUMBER to NUMBER mph. He pitches largely off of that fastball, with one of the highest fastball percentages in the system. While he doesn't miss a ton of bats, that is offset somewhat by the sink and hard, late life that leads to soft contact and a high groundball rate. His curve got a little too hard in NUMBER, which made it tougher for him to control consistently. His changeup hasn't progressed as much as some would have liked to see at this point.PERSON needs to show better consistency from outing to outing in order to stay in a rotation and he might profile best as a short reliever. Either way, the ORGANIZATION thought enough of his right arm to add him to the NUMBER-man roster this offseason.",1
"A two-sport standout at ORGANIZATION in GPE, GPE, GPE was better known for his exploits on the gridiron than the diamond as an amateur. That quickly changed during his senior year in NUMBER, when droves of scouts filed in to lay eyes on the athletic right-hander amid reports that he was up to NUMBER mph with a mid-NUMBERs slider. He signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a third-round pick and had an excellent pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, capping his season with a NUMBER-strikeout performance over six innings in the ORGANIZATION playoffs. GPE continued to impress in NUMBER, beginning the season in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League and advancing to full-season ball at age NUMBER.Though he'll reach the mid-NUMBERs with his fastball, GPE tends to work more in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, displaying feel for pitching to both sides of the plate. Yet, it's the pitch's movement that makes it so dynamic, as GPE's fast arm and low three-quarters slot imparts excellent sinking action that has helped him generate more than twice as many ground-ball outs as air outs in his career. His slider is relatively new to his arsenal but shows the makings of a second plus pitch, thrown with power in the upper-NUMBERs, and he's also made strides in developing his changeup since signing.GPE's athleticism is special, and it's easy to envision the young righty growing into his projectable frame in the coming years. His outstanding sinker gives GPE upside as either a starter or reliever, though he'll need to refine his secondary pitches and develop better command to stick in the rotation.",0
"After selecting Meadows in the NUMBER GPE, the ORGANIZATION nabbed ORGANIZATION five picks later at ORGANIZATION. NUMBER. He was a veteran of the ORGANIZATION program and scouts considered him to be the top catcher in the GPE class.ORGANIZATION is the all-around package. He has a smooth left-handed swing, and he has a knack for barreling up balls. ORGANIZATION's big frame portends solid power when he matures. His defense is advanced for a teenager, his athleticism makes him a good receiver and he has an above-average arm.ORGANIZATION earns praise for his makeup and his high baseball IQ. Those intangibles, combined with his tools, give him everything necessary to become a leader behind the plate for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"GPE may be the best of a deep crop in the GPE prep ranks, showing above average hitting ability, raw power and arm strength with a long track record of hitting.",0
"GPE is the oldest player on The ORGANIZATION and he's only here, despite a career rife with injury and inconsistency, because his stuff is so good. He's among the hardest throwers in professional baseball and also one of the best at spinning the baseball. He is wild and the quality of his secondary stuff is inconsistent, but at times he looks unhittable. He struck out NUMBER in NUMBER big league innings last year, but he's currently on the ORGANIZATION with a forearm strain. He could one day pitch his way into high-leverage innings as long as he has this kind of stuff, which he has maintained despite the many maladies.",0
"PERSON's brother, GPE, is in the big leagues, and as long as people are patient, they'll likely see the younger Bonifacio there, too, in the future. PERSON packs a much bigger punch than his brother, with a fast bat and the ability to drive the ball to all fields. He's shown an ability to make adjustments, a good sign for his development as a hitter. And if he hits, the power will come, as he has at least above-average raw pop. His strong arm combines very nicely with his offensive profile to project him as a prototypical right fielder in the future.",0
"PERSON had back issues in college and scouts weren't enamored with his conditioning, but he had premium velocity, a plus slider and he performed at against ORGANIZATION hitters. He somewhat surprisingly fell to GPE's NUMBERth overall selection in the NUMBER draft. Reports were even stronger in NUMBER. PERSON is remarkably athletic for his size and he's more balanced throughout his delivery now than he was in college. His command has improved and now projects to average or a tick above. PERSON also rebooted a curveball he had shelved at ORGANIZATION and is flashing a plus changeup at times. He's going to have command of four above average or better pitches and rare lefty starter velocity. He has #NUMBER/NUMBER starter ceiling and could reach GPE this year.",0
"PERSON was an early favorite to go near the top of this draft as an underclassman but has had shoulder issues and inconsistent velocity over the last few years, at times touching NUMBER, sitting NUMBER-NUMBER at others. Even when he's throwing hard, PERSON's fastball gets squared, though his curveball has plus projection. He has plus raw power at a plate and is a good athlete with experience catching good stuff as an amateur, but he needs significant defensive development (both as a receiver and thrower, as he's inaccurate) to stay there. If he can, he's a catcher with arm strength and big raw power.",0
"After dealing with PERSON surgery and thoracic outlet syndrome while at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, facing pro hitters late in games may seem like a walk in the park to PERSON, the ORGANIZATION' sixth-round pick in the NUMBER Draft. After a strong first full season and showing in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON pitched his way from Double-A to the big leagues and led the system in saves. He spent most of the NUMBER season in Triple-A, though he did return to GPE, and was sent to the ORGANIZATION in January in a Minor League deal.The ORGANIZATION did give PERSON the chance to start at the outset of his career, but it's clear the back end of the bullpen, where his fastball-slider combination plays up, is the place for him. He creates angle with his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame well, leading to weak contact off of his NUMBER- to NUMBER-mph fastball, though he also misses bats with it up in the zone. His slider has improved to the point of being a true out pitch with hard two-plane break. He's not a big command guy, and while he threw enough strikes previously in his career, his control regressed in NUMBER.PERSON wasn't able to establish himself as a Major League reliever with the ORGANIZATION. He gets a fresh start with the ORGANIZATION and if he can rediscover the strike zone, he still has the chance to pitch in high-leverage situations in the back end of a bullpen.",1
"A closer in college who's seen time as both a starter and a reliever with the GPE, the southpaw spent nearly all of NUMBER pitching out of the pen.The left-hander out of GPE State was better than expected as a starter during his first full season, especially with his control. PERSON' above-average fastball and hard slider play up in the bullpen, though he had shown some ability to log innings as a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter. While there was some concern that his breaking ball backed up as the year went on, he's tightened it up and it's a viable weapon. If the changeup improves and PERSON can throw it for strikes, he could still start.After a couple of starts early in NUMBER, though, PERSON begain focusing solely on coming out of the bullpen, a role he's very familiar with.",0
"The D-backs signed PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION during the NUMBER signing period, then had him skip over the ORGANIZATION to make his pro debut in the GPE before he turned NUMBER. A move to full-season ball to start the NUMBER season didn't go well, but he hit the reset button in the LOCATION last summer and worked his way back up to the ORGANIZATION in the middle of NUMBER.There are no questions about PERSON's defensive work. He will stay at shortstop long-term, with as strong of an arm as anyone in the system, an absolute rifle, though he's also seen some time at second and a little at third. His other defensive skills are well above-average, with outstanding hands and excellent range, even though he's just an average runner. PERSON still needs to add strength to become an offensive contributor. He has a solid approach and will draw walks, but there is no power to speak of. The hope is he'll mature enough to shoot balls to the gaps.Even with the false start in NUMBER, PERSON is still ahead of the curve in terms of age for his level. And even if it takes a while for the bat to come around, he has the chance to be a defensive-oriented regular at a premium position.",0
"PERSON spent his first two college seasons at ORGANIZATION, pitching somewhat sparingly in relief. He transferred to PERSON and started as a junior. The ORGANIZATION took a flier on him in the NUMBERrd round of the NUMBER Draft and let him spend most of his first full season as a starter. A move to the bullpen paid off, and he turned in a big GPE League campaign and was the talk of the ORGANIZATION League following the NUMBER season. His progress was stalled when a shoulder injury kept him out for most of NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION left him unprotected, but he wasn't taken in December's Rule NUMBER Draft.After spending all winter in GPE, PERSON appears healthy and ready to go, with the ORGANIZATION hopeful he can get back to the dominant reliever he was in the ORGANIZATION. He was closing out games, coming in hitting NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball and an absolutely filthy breaking ball. Analytics say his curve is the better pitch, though he also has a good slider with cutting action.Other than health, PERSON's biggest obstacle is his command. He doesn't need pinpoint control, and he has thrown enough strikes at times in the past. Putting the shoulder issue behind him will be step one towards proving he can pitch at or near the end of games.",0
"After swinging a relatively inconsistent bat for much of his career at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON got hot late, lifting himself to the second round of the NUMBER Draft. The adjustments he had made to show that improvement continued into the ORGANIZATION World Series and his pro debut, where he hit for average and power in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. A broken hand forced him out for six weeks of his full-season debut, but he was swinging the bat well again early in the second half of NUMBER.PERSON had shortened his swing and used the whole field more effectively during his junior season, and he carried that over last summer. There had been questions about his hit tool, but he didn't show that in GPE, striking out well below the leave average rate and making good adjustments. If he can continue sticking to his solid game plan, that will allow him to tap into his tremendous raw power -- some evaluators put a NUMBER on it -- with more consistency. While he's a well below-average runner, PERSON is a solid defender at first.The industry often doesn't like the right-right first base only profile, and PERSON will have to continue to prove he can hit to move past that stigma. If the start to his career is any indication, he has the chance to do just that and be a run-producing presence in the middle of a big league lineup.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION decided to trade PERSON at the deadline in NUMBER, they wanted to make sure they got PERSON's live left arm as part of the deal. He's been up-and-down, at best, since joining the organization, though he did show some signs of improvement with a move to the bullpen in NUMBER.Switching from starting to relief is not exactly a shock as PERSON always had the combination of tremendous power stuff with below-average command and control. He does have a plus fastball that he can run up to NUMBER mph and throw it with sink when he has the right angle. He complements that with a really good slider that can miss bats. He remains very tough to hit, but his walk rate -- NUMBER.NUMBER per nine in his career -- needs to come down, even in a relief role.It wasn't perfect coming out of the pen at first, but he started repeating his delivery more consistently in NUMBER, allowing him to pitch across three levels. He's moving in the right direction and has the look of a future short reliever in the back end of a bullpen if he can keep finding the strike zone.",1
"GPE accomplished multiple goals in a November NUMBER trade with the Marlins: clearing NUMBER-man roster space by giving up PERSON and PERSON, acquiring international bonus pool money to bolster its ultimately unsuccessful run at ORGANIZATION and also picking up King. A NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER, when he earned PERSON's lone win in its only ORGANIZATION super-regional appearance in school history, he earned a promotion to Double-A six weeks into his first season as a Yankee.King's best attributes are his two-seam fastball and his command. He has quality life on his NUMBER-NUMBER mph heater, showing the ability to run and sink it on or off either corner. He generates a lot of groundouts and misses his share of bats.While he has had success as a starter early in his pro career, King lacks a solid second pitch. Both his slider and changeup are decent offerings but unlikely to bother big league hitters. Unless he can improve them, he might face a future as a middle reliever who depends on his sinker.",0
PERSON wasn't/isn't a lost cause as a defensive catching prospect but his bat is almost ready for the big leagues and this prompted a move to third base during the ORGANIZATION to accelerate PERSON's timetable to GPE. He certainly has the arm for third. It's an NUMBER-grade howitzer that elicited audible gasps from ORGANIZATION crowds. His hands and footwork at third remain a work in progress. PERSON's swing isn't graceful or attractive but he finds ways to get the bathead to the baseball and hit the ball hard and he has elite hand-eye coordination and bat control. He's a little too aggressive at the plate so the ORGANIZATION and game power might both play down if he doesn't become more selective and we're in wait-and-see mode on the defense.,0
"A native of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION shortly after his NUMBERth birthday in NUMBER. He's performed well in three professional seasons since, advancing to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League as a NUMBER-year-old in NUMBER.  PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate and knows how to put the barrel of the bat on the ball. A switch hitter, he shows off good power from both sides of the plate in batting practice, but employs more of a line-drive approach in games.  PERSON already has a big frame, raising some questions about his future position. He has a strong arm, but a move across the diamond or possibly to an outfield corner is not out of the question. Wherever he ends up defensively, PERSON's bat looks like it'll be good enough to carry him through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Projectable and unpolished, PERSON majorly jumped on radars early in the spring with performances that had scouting directors running in to get a look. While he's leveled off some since, his potential is sure to have teams interested.Right out of the gate, PERSON was up to NUMBER mph with his fastball, albeit with a lack of command. That brought in a lot of heat and he hasn't backed that up consistently. At times, he's matched that velocity, while in other outings he's been more in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. He complements his fastball with a hard curve, showing an ability to spin the ball well, and some feel for a changeup. He rushes his delivery and slowing his mechanics down will allow him to repeat it consistently and throw more strikes. Scouts like the ORGANIZATION of GPE commit's arm strength, his size and his upside potential, even if he's a long way from fulfilling it. It's possible he's shown enough glimpses that he'll go early enough to never head to GPE.",0
"A two-way player from the GPE high school ranks, the ORGANIZATION were able to sign PERSON from GPE Tech when they took him in the second round of the NUMBER Draft. His electric arm and raw stuff give him as much upside as just about anyone in the system, though he has a long way to go in learning how to harness it.PERSON has a tremendous repertoire at his disposal, starting with a plus fastball that has touched NUMBER mph and can sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. He can throw a true hammer curve in the mid-NUMBERs that also misses bats to give him a second above-average pitch, but he doesn't have much of a feel for a changeup yet. PERSON has a bit of a cross-fire delivery. When he's online, he's as good as anyone in the system, but he comes in and out of it, making it tougher for him to command the baseball.A better athlete than you'd think given his size, PERSON should be able make the adjustments necessary to the mechanical flaws in his delivery so he can take full advantage of his stuff.",0
"PERSON showed exciting stuff during his college career at ORGANIZATION, but a combination of a subpar junior season and concerns about a hip injury caused him to fall to the end of the first round. He underwent hip surgery after signing, which kept him from throwing a professional pitch for nearly a year after he was drafted. PERSON made up for some of the lost time in NUMBER, when he dominated over nine starts at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Charlotte and earned a promotion to Double-A GPE in late May. Though he began the NUMBER season in GPE's rotation, the ORGANIZATION decided to shift PERSON to the bullpen in early June, and he's since taken off in the new role. PERSON proved in his first full season that his arm is as strong as ever, showing a consistent low-NUMBERs fastball and reaching NUMBER mph. As a reliever, meanwhile, the right-hander can hit triple digits with his heater, just as he did in the NUMBER ORGANIZATION. PERSON's slider gives him a second above-average offering, and he also can mix in an average curveball as well as changeup for which he continues to demonstrate improved feel. Both his control and command are lacking, although that has become less of a concern after his move to the bullpen this season. When all is said and done with his development, PERSON could be closing games for PERSON, perhaps even as soon as NUMBER.",0
"GPE was a two-way prospect in high school before a shoulder injury ended his future on the mound. It didn't hinder his ability in in the outfield, however, and his above-average speed and athleticism make him a prototypical center fielder. He covers ground well and has shown improving outfield instincts. At the plate, GPE has quick hands and a smooth left-handed swing. In order to reach his potential, he will have to improve his approach. He has surprising pop in his wiry frame but has a tendency to try to hit home runs too often. PERSON hasn't had an easy transition to the ORGANIZATION, his raw tools still give him the chance to develop into a solid everyday player.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took GPE out of ORGANIZATION in the second round of the NUMBER Draft, right after they took fellow college infielder PERSON a round earlier, because they liked GPE' all-around tools at third. He has shown glimpses of all of them thus far in his pro career, with the only question being if he'll make enough contact to get the chance to use them regularly.There is no question GPE will have to cut down on the swing and miss. He struck out more than NUMBER percent of the time in NUMBER and that is not a sustainable rate at any level. If he can refine his approach, he will be able to tap into his considerable raw power more consistently. GPE is a very good athlete with the chance to be a well above-average third baseman defensively. He moves well, throws well and has above-average speed.As rough as it was for GPE in the ORGANIZATION State League, the ORGANIZATION were pleased that he did improve in the second half. There is some upside here, with perhaps a career that could be like a better defensive version of PERSON.",0
"GPE underwent PERSON surgery during his sophomore year at GPE in July NUMBER, and he didn't return to the mound until 'NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION made him their fourth-round pick that June and then limited his workload in his pro debut. GPE moved up to full-season ball in NUMBER and received a quick promotion to the Class A Advanced California League, where he was pitching when the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the ORGANIZATION deal at the ORGANIZATION. While the quality of GPE's stuff fluctuated in his first full year back from surgery, he still showed a lively NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that hit NUMBER with good arm-side run. The right-hander complements his heater with a slider in the low NUMBERs that flashes above average, and he also has a changeup that has yet to materialize post-surgery. GPE's control hasn't been great as a professional, although that's not uncommon for pitchers in the early stages of recovery from PERSON surgery. The ORGANIZATION will continue to develop GPE as a starter, but his fastball-slider pairing and below-average control suggest he'll end up in the bullpen.",0
"Standing NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and weighing close to NUMBER pounds, some have compared PERSON to a teenage PERSON, scouts like PERSON's medium-frame build, his bat speed and his power potential. He has also been praised for his fluid swing and balanced setup at the plate. The broad-shouldered teen can also hit the ball to all fields. The shortstop could end up at third base in the future, but he will likely stay in the middle of the infield for now because of his soft hands, quick feet and range. PERSON also has an average but accurate arm.The son of a colonel in the GPE's military, PERSON has been praised for his makeup and leadership abilities. Competitive and aggressive, he also played in international tournaments in GPE and GPE. PERSON is based in GPE, GPE, and is trained by PERSON.

Following the season, the ORGANIZATION acquired ORGANIZATION, right-hander PERSON and outfielder PERSON Thompson-Williams in the PERSON deal. ORGANIZATION could have three plus pitches when all is said and done. His NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball features some run and sink and is his most consistent offering, though his mid-NUMBERs slider may have more upside. His changeup isn't as reliable as his first two options, yet he still shows the ability to miss bats with it. Throwing strikes consistently remains a challenge for ORGANIZATION, as he regressed with his control in NUMBER after making strides the previous year.Though ORGANIZATION is a little shorter than desired for a starter, he still creates downhill plane with his delivery and doesn't throw with excessive effort. His athleticism and durability aid his chances of becoming a ORGANIZATION. NUMBER starter, though he'll need to make further gains with his control and refine his changeup to reach that potential.",1
"Counting a big league contract for since-traded Hector PERSON, bonuses and tax penalties for blowing past their allotted pool, the ORGANIZATION agreed to pay more than $NUMBER million to sign international players in NUMBER. Their spending spree continued into November, when they landed PERSON for $NUMBER.NUMBER million (plus a matching amount in tax penalties). That was just GPE' third-biggest outlay of the year for a GPE defector, behind $NUMBER.NUMBER million for PERSON and $NUMBER million ($NUMBER million bonus plus matching penalty) for right-hander PERSON Alvarez.PERSON hit .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER in NUMBER-NUMBER as an NUMBER-year-old in GPE's top league, the ORGANIZATION, and was the favorite to win PERSON of the Year honors before he defected in April before the award was given. His most impressive attribute may be his hand-eye coordination, which combined with his quick right-handed bat, allows him to barrel balls. He mainly focuses on lacing line drives from gap to gap but has the strength to provide some power if he opens up his approach. A good athlete, PERSON has plus speed and solid arm strength. He should be able to stick in center field and is capable of playing all three outfield spots.",0
"Few players have taken a more circuitous road to the big leagues than PERSON. He signed as an outfielder with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER but never got past Class A before getting released following the NUMBER season. He made just three pitching appearances in the independent PERSON in NUMBER before hooking up with the ORGANIZATION and reaching the Majors three years later. After beating testicular cancer last offseason, he returned to the big leagues with GPE in NUMBER before going to the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON catcher PERSON in an August trade for PERSON Venable.The first PERSON to reach the Majors, PERSON always showed tremendous arm strength as an outfielder and it has translated well to the mound. He works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and can reach NUMBER with his fastball. He also throws a hard slider that can be a plus pitch at its best but lacks consistency.The key to PERSON finding a permanent role in the Majors will be learning to harness his stuff, which can be overpowering at times, but has trouble finding the strike zone at others. He gives up too many walks and falls behind in the count too often, allowing hitters to sit on and tee off on his fastball.",0
"PERSON was viewed as a potential top NUMBER pick in the NUMBER Draft until he underwent PERSON surgery in May. The injury didn't scare away the ORGANIZATION, who were happy to gamble on the right-hander with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. Though PERSON spent most of NUMBER recovering from surgery, he returned to the mound ahead of schedule in mid-June and made NUMBER starts between Class A Short-Season Auburn and Class A Hagerstown, and then moved up to Class A Advanced Potomac for his first full pro season.The Nats have had success helping young pitchers overcome PERSON surgery, with PERSON and PERSON coming to mind, and it might not be long until PERSON's name is added to that list.PERSON operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball but can top out a few ticks higher, and the pitch tends to jump on opposing hitters due to its late life. His slider is inconsistent but projects as a plus offering, registering in the low NUMBERs with enough depth and tilt to miss bats, and he completes his arsenal with an average changeup that plays nicely off his heater. Meanwhile, PERSON's strike-throwing ability and command during his pro debut was particularly impressive, as pitchers who had PERSON surgery typically don't regain those qualities until they've nearly fully recovered.The Nats have had success helping young pitchers overcome PERSON surgery, with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, the club's NUMBER first-round pick and current top prospect, coming to mind. PERSON's stuff and command will take a back seat to his health next season, but it shouldn't keep the right-hander from making key developmental strides.",0
"A GPE, PERSON joined the ORGANIZATION toward the end of the NUMBER-NUMBER international signing period. He made his GPE debut in NUMBER, tying for the Rookie-level PERSON lead with eight home runs. He has continued to bash in NUMBER, beginning the summer in the Rookie-level PERSON and earning a promotion to low Class A after going NUMBER-for-NUMBER (.NUMBER) with five homers in NUMBER games.PERSON has a lot going on in his right-handed stroke, though his impressive bat speed has allowed him to feast on lower-level pitching. He'll have to quiet his approach and develop some plate discipline to tap into some of the best raw power in the system. Though he tends to swing at everything, he still manages to make a lot of hard contact.PERSON has some defensive value as well. He has seen action at third base, first base and second base this year, and projects to become at least an average defender at the hot corner. He has decent speed and quickness along with a strong arm, though his throwing accuracy needs to improve.",0
"GPE has demonstrated the best control and command in the system since the ORGANIZATION purchased him from the ORGANIZATION's GPE Red Devils for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER. After missing all of NUMBER following PERSON surgery, he made a successful return last season and starred in the ORGANIZATION playoffs as high Class A Buies PERSON won the championship. He has continued to pound the strike zone while making the jump from Double-A to the big leagues in NUMBER.GPE has to locate his pitches with precision because he can't overpower hitters. His best offering is a plus changeup with fade that he sells well by maintaining his fastball arm speed. His heater parks in the low NUMBERs and peaks at NUMBER mph with some armside run.His biggest need is to improve his soft curveball because right-handers have teed off on GPE since his elbow reconstruction. He has proven that he can deliver strike after strike but still has to show he can miss enough bats to succeed against advanced hitters. Projected as a middle reliever or swingman, his floor stands out more than his ceiling.",1
"PERSON's development has been a winding road but he's now trending up once again after a NUMBER trade from GPE for PERSON. He's age appropriate in Double-A, performing well while striking out a good bit, but his underlying ORGANIZATION numbers suggest he's been unlucky with results, is hitting the ball very hard and is still solid-average in center field.",0
GPE's melodramatic career has been on the upswing for over a year now as he seems to have left his ORGANIZATION days behind and is now hurling nasty stuff out of the Double-A bullpen. He could be a high-leverage reliever.,0
"PERSON signed out of the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER, just the eighth-highest bonus the ORGANIZATION paid to sign an international player in NUMBER. He since has established himself as the best prospect from GPE's crop that year, skipping a level to make a strong GPE debut in the Rookie-level GPE League in NUMBER and blowing away low Class A hitters this year. He joined the ORGANIZATION in November, going to GPE with fellow righty prospect PERSON in a trade for seven-time All-Star PERSON's fastball jumped from NUMBER-NUMBER mph when he turned pro to NUMBER-NUMBER mph two years later, peaking at NUMBER. He backs up his heat with a pair of power breaking balls and a changeup with some fade. His slider is probably his best secondary pitch, though some scouts prefer his changeup.Though PERSON has the potential to become a frontline starter, he's a long way from getting there. He has a quick arm and not a lot of effort in his delivery, but he's still learning to repeat it. Though his control and command need polish, he has the upside to pitch in the front half of a big league rotation.",0
"After appearing in NUMBER games but making only one start as a ORGANIZATION freshman in NUMBER, PERSON transferred to JC of ORGANIZATION and dominated as a starter, posting a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA with NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER innings. The performance, along with a heavily scouted bullpen session in late May, during which he hit NUMBER mph, gave the right-hander some serious helium ahead of the NUMBER Draft. The ORGANIZATION ended up selecting PERSON NUMBERth overall with the second of their two first-round picks, then signed him for slightly above slot value at $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER. PERSON continued to thrive in his pro debut, turning in a lights-out performance across two levels, though he's been plagued by injuries in NUMBER. A back injury delayed the start of PERSON's season until early May, and when he finally took the mound, the right-hander logged just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in the ORGANIZATION State League before being struck by a line drive that resulted in a fractured right forearm. PERSON's four-pitch mix is highlighted by the best fastball and slider in GPE's system. He was consistently up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball during the spring and threw even harder in his pro debut, at times bumping triple digits, albeit in shorter stints. PERSON has already cleaned up his slider since signing and now throws it with more power and tilt in the upper NUMBERs, giving him a legitimate put-away pitch to complement his explosive fastball. His changeup is currently ahead of his curveball, with the former grading out as an average pitch and the curve being more fringy. There's some concern regarding PERSON's durability because he had a screw put in his right elbow in high school, but the NUMBER-foot-NUMBER hurler was nothing but healthy and durable in junior college and during his debut. Provided he stays healthy, PERSON seems well on his way toward becoming a No. NUMBER starter, perhaps more if he can improve his secondaries and overall command.",0
"The son of four-time All-Star and NUMBER-year Major League veteran PERSON, PERSON batted .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with nine home runs, NUMBER doubles and NUMBER RBIs as a junior for N.C. State, where he was a three-year starter at first base. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the seventh round of the NUMBER Draft, but it wasn't until the hours leading up to the July NUMBER signing deadline that the two sides reached an agreement on a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus.Like his father, PERSON combines bat speed with a sweet left-handed swing, leading scouts to believe he will continue to hit for average in the professional ranks. His power is mostly to the gaps at present, but he has the potential to develop average over-the-fence pop. As a first-base-only prospect with suspect home-run power, GPE might have trouble fulfilling such a limited profile. There's a chance he could move to left field, but with below-average speed, he's probably best suited for a career at his natural position.",0
"At one point in the spring, PERSON was one of the top college arms in the NUMBER Draft class, even being mentioned in the mix for the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. The big lefty had injury issues, namely with a hip, that led to inconsistent results and concern from the scouting industry about his long-term health. His stock dropped as a result, but the ORGANIZATION used some creative drafting to take him in the ORGANIZATION Round A and sign him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million. If he returns to form, he could be well worth the investment. When he's locked in, PERSON has a plus fastball, a solid hard slurve and a changeup that could be at least above-average. He's still a bit more thrower than pitcher, but that kind of arm strength on a NUMBER-foot-NUMBER lefty is hard to come by.",0
"PERSON had a cameo in the movie ""The ORGANIZATION"" as a high school quarterback, and a position change could have him destined for the bright lights of the big leagues one day. A four-year starter at shortstop for GPE, he lacked the quickness to play there as a pro. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the eighth round in June NUMBER, and they immediately moved him to catcher after signing him for $NUMBER,NUMBER.Club officials say PERSON is taking to the conversion even quicker than ORGANIZATION, who was a third baseman before GPE drafted him out of junior college. PERSON's soft hands, strong arm and leadership fit well behind the plate. He threw out NUMBER percent of basestealers in his pro debut.Though PERSON also posted a gaudy .NUMBER OPS in the hitter-friendly PERSON, his offensive projection is more modest. PERSON uses a gap-to-gap approach, and he is more likely to hit double-digit home runs than produce a high batting average.",0
"The ORGANIZATION were very aggressive in pursuing talent in the Draft in NUMBER, with GPE standing out as a prime example. He was the top high school lefty in the class but slid due to signability, but PERSON was able to get him to sign rather than head to PERSON. His pro debut was shaky results-wise, but the stuff is still there as is the projectability. His fastball can be plus for a lefty and he's done a good job of commanding it in the past. His curve has the chance to be above-average and his changeup gives him a third solid pitch to work with. He's had some delivery issues, but with his athleticism and makeup, he should be able to work through them in time.",1
"PERSON was ranked No. NUMBER on MLB.com's Top NUMBER international amateur prospects rankings prior to the NUMBER signing period. The ORGANIZATION loved his offensive potential and signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million on July NUMBER of that year.PERSON's ceiling lies completely with his bat. He has the kind of swing that could allow him to hit for a lot of power. He's shown some feel to hit with a solid approach as well, drawing walks during his ORGANIZATION debut in NUMBER, though he struggled a bit more during his first time in the GPE a year ago. Big and left-handed, PERSON reminds some of PERSON. Initially an outfielder as an amateur, he quickly moved to first base due to his well-below-average speed. He's a capable defender with a solid arm.If PERSON can watch his conditioning and continue to refine his approach, he could fit the profile of a run-producing first baseman in the future.",0
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER in June NUMBER, GPE made a mediocre stateside debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. However, the ORGANIZATION native certainly opened eyes during his full-season debut at ORGANIZATION A Greenville in NUMBER, showing a vastly improved bat in addition to his usual standout defense at shortstop. After the season, GPE was one of four prospects dealt to the ORGANIZATION in November as part of the ORGANIZATION trade.GPE receives glowing reviews for his plus defense, and there's a contingent of scouts who view him as a future ORGANIZATION Glove-caliber shortstop. Though his speed is fringy, GPE is both athletic and agile, and he shows plenty of range in both directions thanks in part to a quick and instinctual first step. His exceptional hands and strong arm are among the best in the low Minors.GPE made big strides at the plate in NUMBER and especially with his power, finishing seventh in the LOCATION League with NUMBER home runs, but he's taken a step back this year in the GPE. His hitting mechanics can be inconsistent and his aggressive approach leads to some swing-and-miss, but there's something to be said for the left-handed hitter's innate ability to barrel the ball.",1
"If you're looking for wow stuff, or someone to light up the radar gun, look elsewhere. If you want to watch someone who really knows how to pitch, then watch PERSON. The Louisiana-Monroe product was terrific in his first full season, finishing second only to PERSON in the organization in both ORGANIZATION and strikeouts. He does it with average stuff across the board and a whole lot of movement. He stays ahead of hitters and works his fastball in and out with ease. He's not afraid to pitch inside, even if he tops out at NUMBER-NUMBER mph. His slider is very effective, especially against right-handed hitters, and he mixes in a curve and a fringy changeup. He mixes his pitches well and can throw all four for strikes. Don't expect the strikeout rate to continue as he moves up and faces more advanced hitters, but don't count out this control specialist.",0
"Selected NUMBERth overall in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON finished third in the ORGANIZATION with NUMBER home runs in NUMBER, trailing only PERSON and PERSON. He moved up to Double-A GPE last year and hit NUMBER more while ranking second in the ORGANIZATION with a career-best NUMBER doubles. Somewhat surprisingly, PERSON's production has regressed this season in the hitter-friendly PERSON, though he continues to get on base at a high clip. Though his numbers are down, PERSON's raw power still ranks among the best in the ORGANIZATION. He played his home games in a pitcher-friendly GPE ballpark that also is notorious for depressing the numbers of left-handed hitters, especially when it comes to home runs. The left-handed hitter's patient approach continues to net him plenty of walks, though he's unlikely to surpass the century mark in NUMBER as he did in his two previous campaigns. PERSON strikes out quite a bit like any young slugger who sees a lot of pitches, but his strikeout rates have remained fairly consistent as he's moved up the ladder.The A's experimented with PERSON in right field at the end of the NUMBER, and he's once again seen a bulk of his playing time at the position this season. Regardless of his future defensive home, PERSON has the power to hit NUMBER home runs in a season, although it may come with a low batting average.",1
"PERSON was ranked No. NUMBER on MLB.com's ORGANIZATION prospects list leading into the NUMBER signing period and the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to get the top-ranked catcher from that class for $NUMBER,NUMBER as part of a big haul that summer that also included PERSON. PERSON hasn't quite developed as hoped, but he's still young for his level despite having spent the last two full seasons with PERSON in the Class A GPE Atlantic League.The stocky backstop has made some progress and it started to translate a bit into his offensive numbers in NUMBER. He's shown more extra-base ability over the last two seasons as he continues to work on refining his approach and plate discipline. He had gotten off to a strong start in NUMBER when he missed nearly a month with a shin contusion caused by him fouling a ball off his leg. PERSON has one of the strongest arms of any catcher in the ORGANIZATION and a passion for catching, but he has to continue to improve his game calling and working with a pitching staff.PERSON's conditioning has gotten away from him a bit in the past and he will have to work hard to keep his body in shape. But he was also just NUMBER for all of the NUMBER season, giving him plenty of time to develop into the everyday catcher the ORGANIZATION envisioned when they signed him.",0
"PERSON, a GPE native, made his debut last year in the ORGANIZATION. He hit .NUMBER and showed an advanced approach at the plate. PERSON uses the whole field to hit, and he struck out just NUMBER times last year. He should develop average power as he learns to use his strength at the plate. PERSON is still learning to catch after spending time at third base as an amateur. He has a strong arm and threw out NUMBER percent of would-be basestealers. He still has work to do defensively but should develop into a solid defender.",0
"PERSON was having a fine start to his NUMBER season with short-season Vancouver when a broken hand knocked him out of action after just NUMBER games. He did eventually return to action, joining full-season Lansing at the end of the year and starting in center for their short-lived playoff run. The native of GPE's best tool is his speed and it should allow him to steal bases (he's gone NUMBER-for-NUMBER thus far in his career) and play center field. He has good range as a result and could be an above-average defender as he improves his reads and routes. PERSON does have a chance to hit a little bit, albeit without much power, but as a top-of-the-order type, that's not as important.",1
"Acquired as part of the three-team trade in the Dec. NUMBER that sent him and PERSON from GPE to GPE and made PERSON a ORGANIZATION, PERSON's stock was on the rise two years later when he hit .NUMBER as a NUMBER-year-old in Double-A as part of a breakout campaign that earned him a spot on the D-backs' NUMBER-man roster. His development was stalled in NUMBER as shoulder surgery cost him all but NUMBER games. He made a healthy return to Double-A last spring and ultimately garnered honors as the LOCATION Championship Series MVP while leading PERSON to a title. He built upon that progress at ORGANIZATION in NUMBER and made his big league debut in June. PERSON has plus bat-to-ball skills which enable him to make a lot of quality contact from both sides of the plate. His natural hitting ability has improved along with his plate discipline, and he's shown more of a willingness to take walks while striking out less. He may never be a huge power guy, but the improved approach has PERSON starting to tap into his raw power, albeit mostly from the left side. While he's played mostly shortstop, he's shown he can more than handle second base.PERSON looks like he'll be a solid utility player, possibly even soon, with second-division regular potential if he can tap into more power.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft and went well above the $NUMBER,NUMBER threshold to sign him, they knew it would take a while for the ORGANIZATION native to figure things out. The fact he had moved to the Class A Advanced PERSON in NUMBER really put him ahead of that curve, though he struggled there, with his season ending a bit early due to a scapula stress fracture. His future became even more clouded when open heart surgery to repair a faulty valve ended his season, though the ORGANIZATION are optimistic he'll be ready to go in NUMBER.It's unclear how long he had been dealing with the shoulder injury, which could have impacted his overall performance in GPE in NUMBER. He's still a bit of a project, but there are the makings of a three-pitch mix in an excellent pitching frame. He's a physical power pitcher who sits close to the mid-NUMBERs with his fastball. When he's right, he throws with sink to get ground-ball outs. He's continuing to develop his secondary stuff, with a good feel to spin a power curveball and a changeup that is a work in progress. He throws strikes, but gets too much of the zone at times, leading to elevated hit rates.Once PERSON returns to full health, he can get back to shortening the learning curve on his long-term projection. The pieces are still there for him eventually to develop into a mid-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON went undrafted out of high school, but there's no danger of that happening this time around.The ORGANIZATION third baseman has gotten bigger and stronger during his college career. He uses the whole field at the plate with an advanced approach. While he has mostly gap power now, he has the chance to clear some fences in the future. He has fringy speed, but he's a solid and reliable defender at third and should have no trouble staying there.It isn't a great class in terms of college bats, so PERSON's performance will be watched very carefully all spring and he's bound to do pretty well on GPE day.",0
"Originally a seventh-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of high school, PERSON garnered ORGANIZATION honors in the NUMBER Cape Cod League before leading PERSON to an ORGANIZATION regional title the following spring while ranking second in the nation in hitting.

He underwent surgery to repair a partially torn right labrum that October, had arthroscopic surgery on the same shoulder the following February and did not appear in a game in NUMBER. When he finally returned to the field last May, PERSON hit his way up to the Class A Advanced PERSON, with the ORGANIZATION using him exclusively at designated hitter.Even after the lengthy layoff, PERSON still possesses the same combination of hitting ability and power that made him a first-rounder in NUMBER. The right-handed hitter utilizes a short, compact swing and makes hard contact from line to line, and he impressed scouts last season with his raw power and power frequency in games. He can be overly aggressive at times in the box, but overall he has a good approach and controls the strike zone well.PERSON's blend of athleticism and tools still gives him considerable upside as a catcher. He's shown well behind the plate this season in his first action there since NUMBER, though his arm strength will always be a concern after his pair of shoulder surgeries. Should he not stick behind the plate, PERSON's bat and power could also make him a fit in left field or at first base.",0
"| Overall:NUMBER/NUMBER The ORGANIZATION never shied away from high-ceiling high school arms with arm strength, so it surprised few when they took PERSON from the GPE prep ranks in the first round. Heâs been a little slow to develop, even spending some time coming out of the bullpen, but he appeared to be figuring some things out in NUMBER, even after being sent to the Phillies in the ORGANIZATION deal. The fastball is still a plus, touching NUMBER mph. He throws a hard slider as his best secondary offering that has cutting action to it. PERSON will show glimpses of a tight downer curve, but has been inconsistent with it. He even has feel for a changeup, giving him the chance to have four pitches in his repertoire. The biggest thing holding PERSON back has been his command, though his walk rate was better in NUMBER. Heâs never going to be a control artist, but with his stuff, he doesnât have to be, so if he just keeps showing improvement, he still has the chance to be a successful starter at the big league level.",1
"The son of former big league player and manager PERSON, L.J. PERSON was a senior sign out of UConn who received a bonus more than $NUMBER,NUMBER under the pick value of where he was taken.

PERSON's best tool is his bat, a right-handed hitter with an advanced approach at the plate and solid on-base skills. While he's never going to be a huge home run hitter, he does have some extra-base ability. He doesn't seem to fear facing better pitching, and his bat got going further into the NUMBER season. There were concerns about PERSON's defense, but he's improved at second base and the ORGANIZATION think he can stay there. An average runner, he might also be athletic enough to move to the outfield if needed. For now, PERSON will work on putting the suspension behind him and trying to prove he can develop into a decent offensive-minded second baseman.",0
"FACILITY PERSON seemed like the ORGANIZATION' version of PERSON, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER in November NUMBER but not getting cleared to play until March NUMBER because he had presented differing identities and birthdates during the signing process. He built more anticipation by blowing away Rookie-level ORGANIZATION hitters with a fastball that approaches NUMBER mph, and he did the same when he finally made his GPE debut at the start of NUMBER.When FACILITY PERSON got promoted to high Class A last June, however, he learned that he'll need more than sheer velocity to succeed at higher levels.

"PERSON's first month of the season was such a disaster that scouts thought he was either hurt or extremely bored. He hit well in July and August and earned a September call-up, during which he played great defense all over the infield. PERSON has issues getting to balls away from him and probably won't hit for much power, but he's very patient and could reach base enough to hit at the top of a lineup. He's only an average runner but he's also a very gifted athlete with a plus arm and a quick transfer. PERSON can make strong throws to first from all kinds of difficult platforms and projects as a plus defensive shortstop. Table-setting defensive wizards are pretty rare.

He was then sent to the ORGANIZATION, who first drafted PERSON out of high school in NUMBER, as part of the PERSON deal in late July.PERSON showcased a dynamic fastball during instructs, sitting at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and bumping NUMBER in short bursts out of the bullpen. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER left-hander usually operates in the low to mid-NUMBERs as a starter, with significant late movement and downhill plane that generates a lot of whiffs as well as countless broken bats.PERSON's power slider is raw but shows the makings of becoming an out pitch that can miss bats on both sides of the plate. He also has a changeup, though it lags well behind his two main offerings and will need to be developed thoroughly for him to remain a starter. The ORGANIZATION feel he has a chance to start, and will continue to develop him in that role, knowing that he could still jump on the fast track to the big leagues with a move to the bullpen.",0
"Fans of the ORGANIZATION World Series are likely familiar with PERSON, who started twice in GPE as the ORGANIZATION won their first ORGANIZATION title. The right-hander was back as the Friday night starter once again and among many mercurial pitching prospects, he was providing teams with a safe, albeit unexciting, advanced starting pitching option.Since stepping in for an injured PERSON on Friday nights, PERSON has shown the ability to lead a staff. He throws a heavy fastball up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph, sitting in the NUMBER-NUMBER range, but it's more about the plus sink than the velocity. PERSON will throw two breaking balls -- a curve he will use to get strike one and a good slider with good, late bite that he can use as his bread-and-butter pitch. He'll also mix in a solid changeup with good movement.PERSON doesn't have the same ceiling as some of the power college arms in this class, but he also might be the safest bet to reach his. PERSON will have to balance that with the overall lack of success GPE starters have had at the next level historically.",0
"PERSON began his post-high school career on the junior college circuit, at ORGANIZATION State College in GPE. He transferred to PERSON and pitched in relief as a junior, albeit not with good results. The ORGANIZATION liked his stuff enough to take a flier on him in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft. After being sent out as a reliever during his pro debut, PERSON got a chance to start and ran with it, pitching his way across three levels and finishing the year in Double-A.PERSON relies heavily on a fastball-splitter-changeup trio to get hitters out. He'll throw his fastball in the low-NUMBERs with occasional life. His split-finger changeup is his out pitch, and it's a good one, thrown in the low-NUMBERs with tumble that can miss bats and get weak contact. He mixes in a breaking ball as well and has shown the ability to throw strikes, with all three pitches coming from a quick and repeatable delivery.In all likelihood, PERSON ends up back in the bullpen, where his fastball-split combination could play up. His success as a starter has opened some eyes, and at the very least, he has shown he could be a multi-inning reliever.",0
"PERSON's athletic, contemporary, full-body swing makes efficient use of his little frame, and he's able to tap into in-game pull power because of it. He can also play several different positions (NUMBERB, NUMBERB, ORGANIZATION) at varying levels of skill, and he's a solid-average runner. PERSON discussion surrounding PERSON often focused on comparing him to PERSON, both because PERSON crushed PERSON the year before and because PERSON will literally be competing with PERSON for a roster spot as an infield bench contributor. PERSON is a better, more versatile defender, but PERSON has more power.",0
"A two-sport athlete in college, PERSON has really only been playing baseball full time since NUMBER, so while he's advanced in age he isn't in experience. With that in mind, PERSON' NUMBER annual homers despite sky-high strikeout rates are pretty impressive. He has power, he runs well, he throws well. It's a traditional right field profile on its face, just one that is behind the developmental curve and of high risk because of the strikeouts. PERSON has to be added to the NUMBER-man this offseason or risk being Rule NUMBER eligible, making him a trade candidate if a team likes his physical tools and has the NUMBER-man space to let him simmer at Triple-A for another year or so.",0
"GPE isn't the sexiest prep arm, as he doesn't throw particularly hard or have lots of physical projection, but he has a bit of both and, more importantly, advanced feel for a three pitch mix to go with a clean arm action.",0
"The excitement of signing PERSON away from what appeared to be an unbreakable commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE came to a crashing halt when he tore his left meniscus just NUMBER games into his professional career. With youth and a very advanced bat on his side, he should be able to get going again, assuming health. PERSON is a switch-hitter with a natural ability to hit from both sides of the plate. He should hit for average and above-average power when all is said and done, the kind of bat that will fit nicely into the middle of the lineup. PERSON was settling into right field as a pro before the injury, and he has the tools to be an above-average defender with a strong arm, not to mention the offensive tools, to profile well there.",0
"Though he has missed the entire season with a stress fracture in his back, PERSON still should become the first LOCATION Carolina-Upstate player ever drafted above the NUMBERth round. Had he been healthy and proven that he could make the move from reliever to starter, he might have gone in the first two rounds.Coming out of the bullpen for the ORGANIZATION and in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON dealt NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastballs that reached NUMBER. His heater is more notable for its downhill plane -- he's NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and uses a high three-quarter arm slot -- than its life or his command of the offering.PERSON does have enough in his arsenal to start, as he flashes a low-NUMBERs slider with some bite and a deceptive changeup. He'll have to do better job of repeating his delivery and locating his pitches, and he'll have to prove he can hold up in that role. If not, he still could be an effective late-inning weapon out of the bullpen.",0
"Undrafted and unheralded out of high school, PERSON blossomed into one of the top hitters in college baseball and the highest pick ever from GPE. Ranked as the top position prospect in the ORGANIZATION in each of his two summers in college, he went ninth overall in the NUMBER Draft and signed for $NUMBER million.A switch-hitter who's better as a lefty, PERSON exhibits good balance and controls the strike zone well. With plus bat speed from both sides of the plate and some deceptive strength, he should hit for both average and power. He's a solid runner with some basestealing aptitude.PERSON possesses athleticism and has a strong arm, and his value will be even higher if he can play up the middle. He broke into pro ball as a center fielder, though many scouts believe he fits best on an outfield corner. He played mostly second base in NUMBER but lacks smooth infield actions.",1
"After pitching almost exclusively as a starter in his first five pro seasons, PERSON opened NUMBER in the Double-A Richmond bullpen because the ORGANIZATION wanted him to stop pacing himself and attack hitters full bore. When they returned him to the rotation in GPE, he recorded a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in nine starts. He was outstanding as a Double-A starter to open NUMBER, then found the going more difficult following a promotion to Triple-A in mid-May.While his future role may be uncertain, there's no question about PERSON's arm strength. He usually ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball, which has some sink. He also can miss bats with his mid-NUMBERs slider, which tightened up and showed flashes of becoming a plus pitch more often last year. He also uses a changeup but it's not nearly as effective as his other two pitches. PERSON's NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame gives him long levers that allow him to create difficult plane and angle with his pitches, but they also make it tough for him to repeat his delivery. He'll need to improve his command to remain a starter, and he'll also need to prove his durability because minor injuries have prevented him from exceeding NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in a full season before NUMBER.",0
"While the NUMBER season was a lost one for PERSON, both because of performance and injury, he still might have as much upside as anyone in the ORGANIZATION' system.A broken wrist cost PERSON the second half of NUMBER, and he missed the first six weeks of 'NUMBER as he recovered from a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered during the offseason. Now that PERSON is back in action, he's once again trying to maximize his raw tools. Speed is his best asset, and he has plenty of it to spare. It will help PERSON in his new position, as he moves from shortstop to the outfield, where he played in high school.If the switch-hitter can stay on the field and mature as hoped, PERSON could end up being a dynamic top-of-the-order catalyst in the future.",0
"When your uncle is PERSON, there are going to be some lofty expectations. And while this Guerrero is a long way off, he looks poised to live up to them. After tearing up the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, he made his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION and was able to put on a show with his bat in a brief amount of time. He has a shed full of tools with a really high ceiling. Like PERSON, he can hit just about anything thrown his way, strike or ball, though he's shown some approach and willingness to take a pitch here and there. He has tremendous raw power and enough hittability to tap into it consistently as he starts his climb up the ladder. He's a solid runner who's better under way and has a strong arm that -- along with his bat -- will look good in right field for a very long time.",0
"A litany of off-field issues dominate every discussion about PERSON, who can't seem to get out of his own way. A fist fight with a teammate ended a college career marred by various other infractions and inconsistent physical conditioning. PERSON's stuff was really good -- he'd bump NUMBER and flash two plus secondaries -- and he probably would have gone early in the first round of the NUMBER draft had he not been a makeup powder keg, but he fell to pick NUMBER, where GPE decided his talent was worth the gamble. PERSON was sent home during his first pro spring training for repeated curfew violations. He came back in July and made six starts, then was shut down. He was back up in mid-August for a single start, then was shut down again and needed PERSON, which he had at the end of August. The timing of the injury means PERSON may not pitch until NUMBER, when he'll be NUMBER. There's a chance he pitches in GPE next fall or perhaps in the ORGANIZATION, but if not, he'll just be a NUMBER on our lists until we see that the stuff is back.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-rounder out of a ORGANIZATION high school in NUMBER. He impressed with his play in the GPE League during his first full professional season, so much so that he opened his full-season debut as PERSON's primary catcher. Unfortunately, PERSON's promising campaign was derailed in late May when a broken bone in his left hand -- which suffered on a hitter's follow-through -- forced him to the disabled list. Injuries continued to plague PERSON in NUMBER, when a broken hamate in his left hand in early May sidelined him for nearly two months.A right-handed hitter, PERSON has solid power potential thanks to his bat speed and big, strong build. He makes a lot of contact and has a good feel for the strike zone, making him difficult to strike out. But his biggest strides have been made behind the plate, where he exhibits good receiving skills and has worked to improve his throwing.Developing high school catchers takes time, and PERSON could ultimately require quite a bit of seasoning after missing crucial developmental time. However, his capacity to make adjustments gives scouts optimism that he'll continue to improve as he advances in the ORGANIZATION. For now, though, PERSON simply needs to stay on the field.",0
"PERSON has a very quiet, easy swing but somehow still generates plus power. He has middling pitch recognition, which sometimes causes him to mistime pitches. This manifests as lots of awkward or checked swings, but he doesn't typically flail and whiff, and PERSON is strong enough that the contact has a chance to be meaningful even if he didn't take a great cut. It's a fair, power-over-hit corner profile that takes a hit if PERSON should ever need to move to first base. So far he's been playable, but not impactful, at third.",0
"PERSON was picked NUMBERth overall by the Brewers in NUMBER, but when he was diagnosed with Type NUMBER GPE, he headed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE Diego to learn how to pitch with the disease. It's now under control, and PERSON was once again a legitimate Draft prospect in NUMBER. He can run his fastball up to NUMBER mph, sitting in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph zone with some heavy life. His power curveball is a solid average offering with the potential of being an out pitch, his changeup gives him a third usable weapon and he even has a slider to boot. He goes right after hitters and is especially effective when he can keep his fastball down in the zone. PERSON didn't breeze through the college ranks, but he has the tools to be a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"GPE (PERSON) and in the bullpen for much of college, several teams were out on PERSON when the ORGANIZATION made him a NUMBER second rounder. He has had fits and starts of injury in pro ball, and his velocity has waxed and waned. It was back up this spring, in the NUMBER-NUMBER range, but the lost reps have robbed PERSON of changeup and command refinement. His stuff is good, though. The cutter/slider and curveball are both impact pitches, and just on stuff PERSON belongs a half grade higher on this list, because he has No. NUMBER/NUMBER starter or high-leverage relief stuff. But the injury history and velo fluctuation are bothersome, and so too is the way PERSON's strike-throwing has plateaued. He may have some years as a high-leverage reliever or mid-rotation starter, but there's a good chance for some leaner years, as well.",0
"PERSON began the NUMBER season in Double-A and finished it in GPE and has the chance to potentially be a table-setter who plays every day in center field. His best tool is his plus speed and he knows how to use it on the basepaths, swiping NUMBER bases in the Minors over the course of his four years in full-season ball. That speed also helps him in center, where he can really go get the ball and projects to be an above-average defender with a solid arm. The big question is how much PERSON will hit. He knows how to make contact, but could use some better on-base skills to truly profile as a leadoff type. With PERSON in center field, PERSON wasn't able to crack GPE's outfield in NUMBER. PERSON is under contract in NUMBER, leaving PERSON's immediate future unclear.",1
"Based on pure arm strength, there may not be a better pitcher in the ORGANIZATION system than GPE. His fastball can touch triple-digits and he absolutely dominated the ORGANIZATION during his second stint there. The big reason for that was a cut in walks and improvement in his overall command, which made him much less hittable. He has the chance to have three at least average pitches, with an above-average curve that has a big break to it and an effective fading changeup that he throws with good arm speed. He still needs to cut down on the deep counts as he moves up the ladder. If he can become a more consistent strike-thrower, he has the chance to be a solid big league starter.",0
"All PERSON has done anywhere he's played -- from PERSON in GPE to the ORGANIZATION of GPE to his first year-plus of pro ball -- is hit and prove people wrong. He did just that in his first full season in NUMBER, playing across two levels and earning organizational Player of the Year honors. The numbers in NUMBER weren't as impressive, though he still showed a surprising power-speed combination.An undersized outfielder with plus makeup and work ethic, PERSON maximizes the tools he does have. He does have a good approach at the plate with decent bat speed and has shown surprising pop at the plate. He's an average runner, but his instincts allow that to play up on both sides of the ball. The ORGANIZATION have been pleased with how PERSON has looked in center, but he sees time in all three outfield spots. He profiles best as a fourth-outfielder type, but it's never a good idea to limit an overachiever like PERSON.",0
"PERSON la PERSON has been slow to develop since signing out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, which is why the ORGANIZATION gambled and didn't protect him on their NUMBER-man roster following the NUMBER season. His premium velocity gave him some Rule NUMBER Draft buzz, and GPE was relieved when another team didn't claim him.PERSON la PERSON can reach triple digits with his fastball and does it with less effort than most guys who bring that kind of heat. He usually works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with heavy sink. He shows flashes of promise with his slider and changeup, but he lacks a truly dependable secondary pitch and has inconsistent command.It remains to be seen if de la PERSON can make it to the big leagues as a starter, though the ORGANIZATION will continue to use him in that role to give him the innings he needs for development. He has a realistic upside of a No. NUMBER starter but it's more likely he'll contribute out of the bullpen in GPE when he's ready.",0
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON broke out during a sophomore season that saw him lead the ORGANIZATION in a host of offensive categories while playing every inning of every game at shortstop. That led to an invitation to tryout for, and eventually join, ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION last summer. His success carried over to his junior season, while his profile as a college performer has allowed his stock to rise as the ORGANIZATION approached. The ORGANIZATION ended up taking PERSON in the second round and then saved money by signing him for under slot value. Scouts see a future solid, albeit unspectacular, everyday type big leaguer when they watch PERSON, in a sort of PERSON type of mold. He has a pro approach to hitting with a good gameplan at the plate. He sends line drives to all fields and has a little pop from the right side of the plate. He has a plus arm and good hands, but it's unclear whether he can stay at shortstop long term because of his range. A move to second could be beneficial to him and some wonder if he could catch at the next level, something he did out of need during his freshman year at ORGANIZATION's two-year track record of success at the plate to go along with his professional approach to the game overall put an up arrow next to his name. His ceiling might be a bit limited, but he is the type of college performer who tends to surprise upon entering the pro ranks.",0
"A talented enigma at GPE, PERSON's prodigious stuff was finally deployed with some consistency in NUMBER as he struck out a whopping NUMBER hitters in NUMBER.NUMBER innings. His fastball and curveball are both plus while his changeup, slider and command remain fringey, but fringe command is still more than a grade better than what PERSON showed in college. He's progressing but remains a volatile prospect with #NUMBER/NUMBER starter potential",0
"GPE has raced through the Minors since signing as a third-round pick in NUMBER. He reached Double-A NUMBER months after turning pro and topped the ORGANIZATION with NUMBER wins in NUMBER despite being the fourth-youngest ORGANIZATION qualifier in the Triple-A circuit.GPE owns just one consistently above-average pitch, a sinking changeup that he's willing to throw in any count and two or three times in a row. He has good feel for his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball, which he keeps down in the zone and can spot on either side of the plate, and his curveball, which he can vary the shape on. He also mixes in a short slider/cutter.There's little effort in GPE's delivery, which makes his pitches appear quicker and allows him to fill the strike zone with ease. He's a slightly lesser version of fellow Cardinals lefty PERSON and is ready whenever PERSON needs him.",1
"Originally signed out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON made headlines four years later when he authored a NUMBER-game hitting streak, the longest in the ORGANIZATION since NUMBER, spanning parts of four months and two levels. The breakout performance earned PERSON a selection as the World team's starting catcher in the NUMBER ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON, and he went on to finish sixth in the Minors with a .NUMBER average. PERSON only built on that success in NUMBER, as he was named PERSON of the Year, received his first taste of the Majors at age NUMBER in September and then had a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION while learning a new position. But it will now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further PERSON's development after they acquired him from the GPE for relievers PERSON and PERSON during the All-Star break. The switch-hitting PERSON has natural hitting ability from both sides of the plate. Though his approach is aggressive, PERSON generates consistently hard contact to all fields thanks to his advanced bat-to-ball skills and outstanding barrel control. His physical strength and bat speed generates sneaky raw power, especially from the left side, and he's tapped into it more regularly as he's climbed the ladder.After catching almost exclusively during his first four seasons, PERSON spent the entire ORGANIZATION working at third base and then split time between the outfield and catcher in NUMBER as the GPE explored ways to get his bat into the lineup. That versatility could help him get everyday at-bats with the ORGANIZATION, too, though for now the club appears intent on keeping PERSON behind the plate.",1
"When PERSON was coming out of ORGANIZATION in GPE as a teammate of GPE prospect PERSON, he was a projectable prep right-hander with a solid feel for pitching. That pitchability remains his calling card, and though his stuff hasn't ticked up the way some anticipated, he's still had success, finishing sixth in the system in ORGANIZATION in NUMBER.Velocity-wise, PERSON's fastball is about average, with a four-seamer that tops out at around NUMBER mph, but his ability to sink his two-seamer and his command of the pitch make it play up. His changeup is solid average and his slider, while inconsistent, might get to PERSON average as well. But more than anything, PERSON is a strike-throwing groundball pitcher, one who is efficient with his pitches and able to log innings when he's at his best. He may never be a big swing-and-miss guy, but there is the chance that there is a bit more in the tank stuff wise given that he'll be just NUMBER for all of the NUMBER season.The right-hander gets high marks for his work ethic and for understanding who he is as a pitcher. He is capable of using all of his pitches well, something he'll have to do to continue having this kind of success at the upper levels of the system.",0
"The ORGANIZATION bolstered their system by acquiring two of baseball's best shortstop prospects since the NUMBER All-Star break. They got PERSON from the ORGANIZATION in a package for PERSON in July and PERSON from the Athletics as part of the ORGANIZATION Zobrist/Yunel Escobar trade in January.Signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as a supplemental first-round pick, PERSON stands out most with his bat. With a short stroke and an all-fields approach, he makes consistent line-drive contact. His hitting acumen, bat speed and strength should give him at least average power down the road.Though PERSON is a below-average runner, he makes plays at shortstop thanks to his arm strength and instincts. His ability to read balls off the bat gives him deceptive range, and he also has soft hands. If he has to move, his bat still should profile well at second or third base.",0
"A NUMBERrd round pick in NUMBER from GPE, PERSON has never been considered much of a prospect. But he has hit everywhere he's gone, from college to the ORGANIZATION, and his breakout season at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Inland Empire has been too much to ignore. None of PERSON's tools stand out, but he does everything well. He creates good bat speed from the left side, which translates into solid power. He is an aggressive hitter and has room to improve his pitch recognition. Defensively, he has settled into left field after moving around the diamond in college. That puts more pressure on his bat, but as he's shown so far, that might not be a problem. PERSON will have to prove his breakout isn't a product of the GPE, but he has firmly put himself on the map as a prospect.",0
"In his first season with the ORGANIZATION after joining them via the ORGANIZATION trade, PERSON managed to throw just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings because of shoulder issues. PERSON to prove his worth to the team that dealt for him, PERSON did just that in NUMBER, staying healthy and throwing well in Triple-A while also pitching in the ORGANIZATION in what he hopes to be his home park, PERSON Field.Coming from his huge NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame, PERSON's upper-NUMBERs fastball gets on hitters in a hurry. He throws downhill, with sink, consistently, leading to groundballs when he isn't missing bats. His sharp slider adds to the strikeout rate, NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings through NUMBER, and his changeup has improved, giving him another sinking weapon. PERSON still struggles with his command -- his walk rate jumped back up in NUMBER -- largely because so much can go wrong with a delivery from a pitcher this tall. That, along with shoulder fatigue at the very end of the season, may have been the reason why the ORGANIZATION didn't bring him up last September.The NUMBER-year-old PERSON is ready for a shot and could make a big contribution to a young rotation in NUMBER. If he can harness his stuff a bit more consistently, he could stick around for a long while.",0
"Back in ORGANIZATION after three seasons in GPE, PERSON has a swing and miss fastball (just over NUMBER% swinging strike rate in the minors) and viable slider and changeup. He's NUMBER and could decline at any moment, but he could be a good middle reliever in the short term.",0
"In his brief time as a pro, PERSON has shown a knack for doing one thing very well: hit. And as most baseball people will tell you: If you can hit, you'll likely find a job in the big leagues.PERSON was raking in the ORGANIZATION State League during his first full season in NUMBER before a broken wrist forced him out for a month. He has a knack for making consistent hard contact, and with a NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame, he should add strength, which should lead to some of his doubles clearing fences. PERSON' other tools won't jump out at you, but he has the skills to be a decent corner outfielder.PERSON has played some corner infield in the past, and he could get another look there, but it's his ability to swing the bat that will continue to propel him up the ladder.",0
"The GPE high school product, while not the biggest guy in the world, has some serious arm strength. He can get his fastball up to the mid-NUMBERs with a decent breaking ball to go with it. He even shows some feel for a changeup, giving him the chance to have a full repertoire of at least PERSON average pitches.Hollon has a similar frame to PERSON, and that might be his ceiling. More than anything, though, he needed to show he was healthy this spring after leaving the LOCATION Pro Showcase with forearm tendinitis and not pitching for the rest of the summer.He was doing just that, throwing well during the regular season in GPE, perhaps allowing him to quietly climb back up Draft boards.",0
"GSP has been traded twice -- PERSON sent him and PERSON to GPE for PERSON in NUMBER, and then in NUMBER, GSP was part of the massive, three-team trade involving PERSON and PERSON, among others -- and finally looked like he'd get a long-term big league look in NUMBER. He was ten innings shy of exhausting rookie eligibility when he tore his ORGANIZATION and had PERSON in early June. It's an awkwardly-timed surgery that might keep GSP out for all of NUMBER as he recovers. He has No. NUMBER starter stuff when healthy, but we may not see it in the big leagues again until GSP is NUMBER.",0
"PERSON was a bit of an anomaly in the NUMBER GPE class. High school second basemen aren't all that common. His bat and speed put the GPE prep standout high on GPE boards, and the Rockies were pleased he was still available when their turn in the ORGANIZATION Round A, at ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall, came around. He lived up to his advanced billing by raking during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON has outstanding bat speed from the left side of the plate and he makes consistent line-drive contact to all fields. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, he does have some pop and should have the ability to keep pitchers honest as he progresses. He has an advanced approach at the plate and draws his fair share of walks, allowing his plus speed to work. He should continue to be a threat on the basepaths.A pair of shoulder injuries concerned some and has limited PERSON to the right side of the infield. But his exciting offensive profile should carry him up the ladder, even if it's as a bat-first second baseman.",0
"A Draft-eligible sophomore from PERSON, PERSON received almost $NUMBER,NUMBER over slot value to sign with the ORGANIZATION as a sixth-round pick. He got off to a strong start in the ORGANIZATION during his pro debut.PERSON is the prototypical college performer who has the chance to stay up the middle. He makes consistent hard contact and has a very advanced approach at the plate. He has no power to speak of, but he works counts and draws walks. He's not a burner, but he's a very aggressive baserunner who's not afraid to take an extra base. Defensively, PERSON has the hands, instincts and range to stay at shortstop. His arm, though, might be a bit short for the position, which could necessitate a move to second base.Wherever PERSON plays, and it might be as a utilityman when all is said and done, he's the type who will outplay his tools, hitting for average and getting on base as he climbs the ladder.",0
"PERSON was notable early in his prep career not only for his meteorological name, but also for his talent. He developed tools early -- average raw power, plus speed, a good swing from both sides -- and had a projectable body that enabled a favorable extended forecast for those tools. But scouts didn't always see the performance they wanted from him during his developmental stage in high school or his maturation phase early in his college career at FACILITY, even though the tools were consistently there. His BB/K ratio was fine in college, but his ORGANIZATION was very low, due in part to weaker contact and a slow first step out of the box, but also some bad luck. He's progressed offensively in pro ball and his power has finally begun to show up in the stat line. 
He's fringy in center field and now has a textbook fourth outfielder profile. Some teams prefer his switch-hitting bat and power to PERSON's; others would rather have PERSON's wheels and superior feel for contact, but they have similar likely future roles.",0
"The ORGANIZATION' inability to sign NUMBER first-rounder PERSON ultimately allowed the club to land PERSON, who received an $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus as a NUMBERth-round pick. He has established himself as one of the best all-around hitters in the system in NUMBER and was having a strong second half in the Class A Advanced PERSON when a broken hamate prematurely ended his season in GPE. He made a smooth transition to Double-A in NUMBER and was hitting for both average and power when he landed on the disabled list in mid-July. PERSON has been PERSON's calling card since his days at ORGANIZATION (Calif.) High, but it wasn't until last season that he began to apply it consistently in games. The left-handed hitter's swing is compact and explosive and he knows how to use the whole field to hit. He's quick enough to turn on good velocity but also has the strength and barrel control to drive the ball out of the park the other way. His approach and plate discipline have both improved as he's moved up the ladder, and he's not afraid to hit when behind the in count.PERSON's burly physique and bottom-of-the-scale speed limit him to first base, where he's a below-average defender but working hard to improve. He's long impressed the club with his work ethic and desire to stay in shape. There will always be pressure on his bat as a first-base-only prospect, but PERSON has the hitting ability and power to fulfill the difficult profile.",0
"Signed in July NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON spent his first three pro seasons in GPE ball before finally advancing to a full-season level for the first time in NUMBER. He scuffled a bit the following year, receiving a mid-season demotion from the Class A Advanced California League back to Class A PERSON, but rebounded with a breakout NUMBER campaign in which he established career highs in most offensive categories. PERSON continued to perform well in the ORGANIZATION, and the A's added him to the NUMBER-man roster after the season.PERSON makes a lot of contact from the left side of the plate, where he employs an open setup with a flat swing that enables him to spray the ball across the whole field. While it does limit his power potential, PERSON has a knack for finding the gaps and uses his plus speed to take extra bases when possible. That speed also makes PERSON a capable center fielder, and he has the requisite arm strength needed to play right field.With his left-handed bat, speed and defensive versatility, PERSON has the makings of becoming a future bench outfielder at the highest level. If he can make further strides as a hitter, and possibly add some power to his game, he could take on a greater role.",0
"PERSON could be the next ORGANIZATION of GPE left-hander to become an All-Star, following in the footsteps of PERSON and PERSON. He has a ceiling as a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter if he can improve his changeup and command, and if not, he has enough pure stuff to be a closer. The NUMBER second-rounder was sent to GSP, along with fellow pitching prospect Zach Eflin, for PERSON in December.PERSON's best pitch is his nasty slider, which reaches the mid NUMBERs. He can drop it in on the hands of left-handers or on the back foot of right-handers. After working at NUMBER mph to NUMBER mph with his fastball during his junior season with the ORGANIZATION, PERSON pitched more at NUMBER mph to NUMBER mph in his pro debut. Lengthening his stride during instructional league helped him reclaim that lost velocity.PERSON's delivery looks a little stiff, and it features some recoil, leading some scouts to question whether he can develop the third pitch and control to remain in the rotation. PERSON is starting to throw his changeup more often, and it has made some progress.",0
"PERSON is one of the most physically gifted and enigmatic prospects to come through the ORGANIZATION system in years. The son of former ORGANIZATION wide receiver PERSON, he signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as a fourth-rounder in NUMBER and established himself as one of the best prospects in baseball with a breakout season in NUMBER. His effort and performance were terribly disappointing the next two years, then he got back on track and made his big league debut before injuring his shoulder in NUMBER.PERSON has the upside of a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER homers and at least as many steals per season. He controls the strike zone better than ever but he has too much going on in his approach and has sacrificed some of his power. Though he has plus speed, PERSON has lost a step since the days when he ranked as GPE's top prospect. He has yet to polish his basestealing and has gotten in trouble for failing to run out groundballs. The one area of his game that hasn't slipped is his defense, as he's still a quality center fielder with an average arm.",1
"Things haven't gone quite as smoothly as hoped for PERSON, who hit his way into the first-round landscape at ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. After a torrid pro debut and an equally disappointing first full season, the toolsy outfielder did take some positive steps in the ORGANIZATION State League in NUMBER, though it didn't carry over to his Double-A season in NUMBER.PERSON still has an intriguing power-speed combination, one that allowed him to steal NUMBER bases and hit NUMBER homers, both of which landed him in the top NUMBER in the pitching-friendly ORGANIZATION, before a late promotion to Double-A. He still has a good feel for hitting, with solid walk and strikeout rates, though he's a bit streaky at the plate. PERSON didn't try and chase a higher batting average, a good sign after NUMBER, when he often tried to do too much. PERSON's speed does help him in the outfield, though he played more left than center field in NUMBER. He's better in the corner, but the ORGANIZATION feel he can play up the middle if needed.There is some concern that PERSON has a bit of a tweener profile, one who is destined for a career as a productive fourth outfielder. That might be his floor, but the tools are still there to develop into a big league regular.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $NUMBER,NUMBER back in September NUMBER after he had impressed club officials during an event in his native ORGANIZATION. He showed promise during his stateside debut in the ORGANIZATION and continued to make progress last year in his full-season debut, only to regress this season as a member of Class A Advanced PERSON's starting rotation.PERSON can run his fastball up to NUMBER mph and typically sits in the low NUMBERs, though his velocity did fluctuate at times in NUMBER. His changeup is his best secondary pitch and receives solid-average grades from evaluators, who note that the right-hander throws the pitch with confidence. PERSON's breaking ball and control are both well below average and will be focal points in his development in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION have helped PERSON simplify his delivery in the past year, but scouts still question whether his wiry frame will be able to handle the rigors of a full regular-season workload. If he's unable to stick in the rotation, PERSON's power arm and changeup could make him an effective late-inning reliever.",0
"GPE first-round pick PERSON wasn't the only blue-chip prospect at ORGANIZATION (PERSON, Ga.) this spring. PERSON actually entered the year with a higher profile and dropped to the NUMBERth round only because he was strongly committed to GPE. The ORGANIZATION managed to lure him away from the ORGANIZATION with a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus.PERSON is a true speedster who can cover NUMBER yards in less than NUMBER.NUMBER seconds and get from the right side of the plate to first base in NUMBER.NUMBER seconds on a drag bunt. He projects a basestealing threat and a quality defender in center field.Some area scouts thought that PERSON will need to make adjustments to his right-handed swing in pro ball. He has a choppy stroke with some arm bar, and it can get long when he gets overly aggressive. He does have impressive hand-eye coordination and bat speed, so he could hit for average with some power once he refines his swing and gets stronger.",0
"The first thing you notice about PERSON is his hefty frame. He's listed at NUMBER-foot and NUMBER pounds, but he's a bit north of that and has come into the last two spring training camps larger than expected. That said, PERSON's build isn't seen as a huge problem going forward, as it hasn't impacted his stuff, and most think he just needs to keep it in check a bit. PERSON indicated to us that had he not hit his innings limit late in NUMBER, he would've gotten a big league look in September. The condition of PERSON's pitching staff is certainly favorable for a soonish PERSON debut, and he'll likely open NUMBER in Triple-A. 
He has above-average big league stuff, especially for a lefty: he sits NUMBER-NUMBER and hits NUMBER mph, mixing in a solid average slider and a plus changeup. His command ranges from NUMBER to NUMBER depending on the start, and PERSON's build often leads scouts to believe this is due to his conditioning. We're wary of discounting a player just because he doesn't fit traditional rubrics for success, and baseball is littered with unusual frames and mechanics, but PERSON has also had hamstring and oblique issues. The stuff is of the GPE. NUMBER to GPE. NUMBER/NUMBER starter range, but there's also a chance PERSON ends up in the bullpen. PERSON, considering PERSON's current predicament, we expect him to be developed as a starter for as long as possible. He'll likely be up in NUMBER.",0
"Back in NUMBER, PERSON was one of the more intriguing two-way high school players in the GPE class. The ORGANIZATION liked him on the mound better and gave him $NUMBER,NUMBER in the NUMBERth round to keep him from hitting and pitching at FACILITY. After a breakout season in NUMBER that saw him reach Double-A, PERSON was sent to the ORGANIZATION, along with PERSON, in the ORGANIZATION Chapman deal.The key to PERSON' success in NUMBER was consistency along with an uptick in his stuff. Using his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame more effectively, PERSON' fastball sits comfortably in the low-NUMBERs, but he easily reaches NUMBER-NUMBER mph with regularity. He throws it with good movement so when he isn't missing bats, he's eliciting soft contact. He complements his heater with a power curve that also can miss bats. His changeup, while his third pitch, has improved over time. PERSON' walk rate went way down while his strikeout rate went up in NUMBER.PERSON has come a long way in a year, going from the bottom third of the ORGANIZATION' Top NUMBER to being considered the ORGANIZATION' second-best starting prospect at the time of the trade. He has mid-rotation potential.",0
"PERSON was one of the most signable high school arms in the NUMBER Draft class as he and father PERSON, the former All-Star closer, made it very clear that he wanted to begin his pro career. He signed for pick value with the ORGANIZATION and is ready to use his projectable frame and stuff to move up the organizational ladder. PERSON has an above-average fastball that touches NUMBER mph and there could be more in the future as he adds strength. His curve and changeup, while not quite as advanced as his fastball, both have the chance to be at least PERSON average in the future. His upside combined with his PERSON bloodlines should have the ORGANIZATION excited to see what he can do.",0
"This ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION reliever really impressed during his time in the ORGANIZATION, and while he was slowed by a rib cage muscle strain, he was throwing well as the ORGANIZATION' closer during his junior season.A bulldog right-hander, PERSON is all power, with a sinking fastball that sits mid-NUMBERs and can touch more than that. He complements it with a power breaking ball that can be an out pitch at times. With slightly better command and perhaps a little refinement to his breaking stuff, he has the kind of arm that could close games at the ORGANIZATION level.With starter PERSON a potential early first-rounder and PERSON finishing games off, there were many reasons for scouts to head to ORGANIZATION games this spring.",0
"PERSON is the cousin of famed GPE hurler PERSON, who is the all-time wins leader in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON defected in NUMBER, and the PERSON signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER in November NUMBER. Early success by the left-handed reliever was forgotten when he missed most of the NUMBER and NUMBER seasons coming back from elbow surgery, but he got back on track in 'NUMBER and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in early September. Though he is undersized at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, PERSON has a live arm that can generate a fastball up to NUMBER mph with sinking action that helps him to generate a fair amount of ground-ball outs. He's shown the ability to add and subtract from his slider at times to miss bats and can even mix in a changeup on occasion. He generally stays around the zone and has a strong record of throwing strikes.  If he can stay healthy, PERSON could prove to be an effective bullpen piece for PERSON in the near future thanks to his ability to record outs against right- and left-handed hitters alike.",0
"On July NUMBER, NUMBER, PERSON represented the ORGANIZATION, the team that signed him out of the GPE in NUMBER, in the ORGANIZATION, pitching a perfect inning and striking out two. Less than three weeks later, he was on his way to the ORGANIZATION organization as part of the PERSON trade.PERSON didn't have to go far, traveling from GPE to GPE in the ORGANIZATION State League and bringing his big stuff with him. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER lefty is all about power with a fastball that sits in the low-NUMBERs and has good sink to it when he's throwing downhill. His slider shows glimpses of being above-average and while his changeup needs work, he has enough feel for it to become a Major League average pitch in the future. ORGANIZATION remains the southpaw's biggest problem as he's walked more than NUMBER.NUMBER per nine in his ORGANIZATION career.PERSON has shown glimpses of putting it all together and commanding his three-pitch mix and since he'll be just NUMBER for all of NUMBER, the inclination is to let him keep starting. If the command doesn't improve, a career as a power lefty out of the bullpen isn't out of the question.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million by the ORGANIZATION as the NUMBERth overall pick in the NUMBER Draft, ORGANIZATION got included in two blockbuster trades in the next three years. The ORGANIZATION landed him and PERSON as part of their package for PERSON and PERSON in July NUMBER, then spun him with three other players to the ORGANIZATION Chapman two years later. He went into a long funk at the plate after fracturing his kneecap in August NUMBER but snapped out of it at the end of last season and made his big league debut this April. But without a clear path to playing time in a deep GPE outfield, the ORGANIZATION sent ORGANIZATION and PERSON to GPE in July in exchange for J.A. PERSON. ORGANIZATION's best attributes are his smooth left-handed swing, bat speed and hand-eye coordination. He demonstrated a disciplined approach at lower levels of the Minors but has become more aggressive and now emphasizes power over hitting for average. Scouts who believe his late-season surge in NUMBER is for real see his upside as a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER homers per year, though he attained that average just once while topping out at NUMBER homers in his first four full seasons.ORGANIZATION broke into pro ball as a center fielder and has spent most of the last three years as a right fielder. He's just a decent athlete with average speed and fringy arm strength, so he's best suited for left field, although the ORGANIZATION did have him play first base in the ORGANIZATION to enhance his versatility.",1
"PERSON, the son of former ORGANIZATION manager and current GPE bench coach PERSON, was regarded by scouts as a top-three-rounds talent in NUMBER, but questions about his potential signability caused him to drop to the NUMBERth round, where the GPE signed him away from his Rice commitment with a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus. After a somewhat slow start to his career, PERSON has begun to show the tools that endeared him to scouts this year in his full-season debut.The switch-hitting PERSON has a quick stroke and sound approach from both sides of the plate, and he offers value on the basepaths with his average speed. He know how to drive the ball and shows power potential, though mostly from the left side, and he should start getting to it more in games as he adds strength to his projectable frame.Having grown up around the game, it shouldn't come as a surprise that PERSON has advanced instincts in all facets of the game. Defensively, he has a chance to stick at shortstop, where he has refined footwork, good range, and a strong, accurate arm. If not, he has the tools to be a standout defender at second base as well as the offensive upside for the hot corner.",0
"When you invest heavily in the Draft in high school pitching, you never can be sure which of the young arms are going to pan out. It was looking like PERSON, taken in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft but signed to an over-slot deal of $NUMBER,NUMBER, might have been the first of the young arms targeted by the ORGANIZATION to impact the big league rotation until he required PERSON surgery in May. When healthy, PERSON is a command and feel type of pitcher, though he does have good stuff. He'll touch NUMBER mph with his fastball and sits comfortably in the low NUMBERs, commanding the pitch well. He throws his changeup with the same arm speed and good deception. His big curveball gives him a third at least average offering. PERSON does a good job of using his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame to his advantage and throws strikes with all three pitches thanks to a clean and repeatable delivery. PERSON might not have the highest ceiling among pitching prospects, but once he's NUMBER percent back from surgery, he'll be close to being able to reach it at the big league level.",0
"If you want to get a sense of the depth of the ORGANIZATION middle infield, take a look at the end of the ORGANIZATION report (ninth on this list). It's a testament to PERSON' breakout NUMBER season that he's even in that conversation, as many scouts thought the ORGANIZATION had drastically overdrafted him in the third round out of GPE State in NUMBER. PERSON played second base in college and had an all-fields, spray approach with little power but excellent pitch selection and plate discipline. He was getting pegged as a non-impact type, the sort of backup second baseman the likes of which teams don't carry anymore; his best ability (pitch selection) wasn't even a tool, and it didn't matter much if he didn't have any power. Most of that changed in NUMBER as the ORGANIZATION' strategy of drafting players projected as second baseman and seeing if they can play shortstop worked out, with PERSON's defensive metrics grading PERSON at +NUMBER runs over NUMBER games, about as high of a number as you'll see in the minor leagues. PERSON tended to agree that PERSON was above average at the position, more due to angles and instincts than raw tools, and this development seemed to surprise even the ORGANIZATION. Offensively, PERSON started driving the ball more and doing some extra base damage when he was getting into good counts. The raw tools are still mostly average and he was NUMBER years old in Low-A, a function of the ORGANIZATION' middle infield depth blocking a deserved promotion, so there isn't amazing upside here. That said, a player many scouts thought was an overdraft now looks like he has a solid shot to turn into a good utility guy or low-end regular just NUMBER months later.",0
"Signed back in May of NUMBER, PERSON has been brought along slowly by the Phillies by pitching largely in relief. There has long been talk of his skills translating to the rotation -- he did make four starts in the LOCATION League in NUMBER -- and he was moved into the ORGANIZATION rotation in late May in NUMBER.The NUMBER-year-old PERSON has a fastball that hits NUMBER mph regularly in shorter stints, and his slider is a true out pitch that misses plenty of bats. He has a changeup that will need to continue to develop for him to remain a starter. A good strike-thrower, PERSON shows a lot of confidence on the mound and goes right after hitters.It might take longer for him to develop as a starter, and the Phillies are more than willing to remain patient. As a reliever, PERSON could follow PERSON and perhaps PERSON in a line of power arms that started slowly then took to a role and moved rapidly through the system.",1
"PERSON didn't perform in his first try at the ORGANIZATION State League, reaching base at just a .NUMBER clip before his season ended with a thumb fracture, which required surgery. Don't be fooled by his unconventional swing; he has feel to hit and feel for lifting the ball in the air regularly. But too often, PERSON swings at whatever he's offered, limiting the quality of his contact and his ability to reach base. At first base, that might be a problem. Scouts have mixed opinions about his body and how it projects into his mid-to-late-NUMBERs, which is when PERSON will likely be on the NUMBER-man fringe, perhaps a fit for some clubs in need of, or with room for, a big-bodied masher on their NUMBER-man. The raw power and feel for lift/contact are enticing, but a more sentient approach would be nice.",0
"A native of GPE, GPE has been a fixture of the World roster at the ORGANIZATION Game for the last three years. He saw his first extended stint in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, appearing in NUMBER games.GPE stands out most for his defense. He has well-above-average arm strength and has thrown out at least NUMBER percent of basestealers in every year of his ORGANIZATION career. Though he is susceptible to lapses behind the plate, he has the athleticism and receiving skills to be a solid defender. Offensively, he has some power but is an overly aggressive hitter and strikes out a lot.GPE has long been considered the ORGANIZATION' catcher of the future. Now, having seen PERSON and PERSON leave GPE in the last two years, the future has arrived, and GPE is expected to become the ORGANIZATION' starting backstop.",1
"PERSON broke out as a prospect by winning PERSON MVP honors in NUMBER, then followed up by topping ORGANIZATION Division I in runs (NUMBER), hits (NUMBER) and triples (NUMBER) and leading PERSON to an improbable PERSON berth the next spring. After signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a supplemental first-round pick that June, he paced the high Class A GPE League with NUMBER steals in his first full pro season. His progress crashed to a halt when an errant pitch broke his left wrist last April, sidelining him for three months.PERSON's entire game centers around his plus-plus speed. He uses his quickness to reach base, he's a big-time threat to steal once he does and he covers a lot of ground in center field. He's a skilled bunter as well.His flat swing produces no power, so PERSON concentrates on putting the ball in play. He has good instincts in all phases of the game, enhancing his chances of becoming a regular in the big leagues. He's the best outfield defender in the upper half of the ORGANIZATION organization, so he could make his big league debut in NUMBER.",1
"Despite being a high schooler who barely pitched during his summer debut, the ORGANIZATION felt confident enough in PERSONâs abilities and maturity to send him straight to full-season ball for his first full year of pro ball. PERSON responded with an ERA that would have been good for third in the LOCATION PERSON had he thrown enough innings to qualify. The GPE prepster (coming from the same class as first-rounders PERSON and PERSON) has the chance to have three Major PERSON average or better pitches with solid command. His fastball and slider combination would be enough to excel in the bullpen, but if his changeup can continue to improve and give him that third pitch, he has every chance to start.",0
"PERSON PERSON has produced eight big leaguers, but never a first-round pick. After a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION last summer, it looked like PERSON might change that, though some question marks resulted in him landing in the second round.PERSON stands out primarily for his size and fastball. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pounder sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches NUMBER, though his heater can get hit more than it should because it tends to straighten out. PERSON's secondary pitches are still a work in progress. His improving cutter is his No. NUMBER option, he's not afraid to throw his firm changeup and he also has a curveball that often devolves into a slurve. He does a nice job of using his height to drive his pitches down in the strike zone. PERSON did miss some time in NUMBER with biceps tendinitis, but made a healthy pro debut after signing. If he can show an ability to maintain his stuff deep into starts, he has the chance to stay in a rotation.",0
"GPE comes from a baseball family, with a father who made it to Triple-A with the ORGANIZATION, an uncle who played in the ORGANIZATION organization and a brother who currently plays in the ORGANIZATION organization. PERSON made a name for himself as a three-year starter at ORGANIZATION and was one of the better performers in the ORGANIZATION, finishing his college career with a .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER batting line in NUMBER games. That consistency earned GPE a third-round selection by the Indians in June, and he continued to impress in his pro debut by raking at two levels en route to a full-season promotion. A left-handed hitter, GPE has outstanding on-base skills and a strong track record with the bat. He walked (NUMBER) far more often than he struck out (NUMBER) at ORGANIZATION, and that, along with his excellent speed, makes him a potential table-setter in the future. There is some raw power to tap into, though it's not a huge part of his game. Stealing bases is, however, and he has been very efficient on that front. Defensively, some see a move off of shortstop, mostly because his fringy arm won't play there, so it wasn't a surprise when he lined up at the keystone for much of his pro debut. GPE' on-base skills and bat will need to translate for him to be successful in the professional ranks, especially if he's forced further down the defensive spectrum. If at all clicks for him, GPE could develop into a bat-first, second-division regular at second base.",0
"Signed as an undrafted free agent out of GPE, PERSON has reached Double-A and performed at each stop, accumulating a NUMBER:NUMBER strikeout-to-walk ratio in NUMBER pro innings. He's a low slot lefty with below-average velocity, on the surface appearing to be of the ORGANIZATION endangered species. But PERSON can really spin a breaking ball, and has a four-pitch mix that you could argue plays like a six-pitch mix because he likes to vary his arm slot. He could be a non-traditional bullpen mainstay.",0
"After signing for $NUMBER.NUMBER million out of the ORGANIZATION as the top-rated prospect on the NUMBER international market, PERSON developed slowly in his first two pro seasons. That changed in NUMBER, when he put on an offensive and defensive show at the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON and won the ORGANIZATION MVP award at age NUMBER. He continued to stand out as one of the youngest players in the ORGANIZATION and again in NUMBER, changing teams in July when the PERSON used him as the centerpiece of a four-prospect package to acquire PERSON Quintana.The PERSON likened him to PERSON when they signed him, but PERSON has a better chance to hit than PERSON and drew some upside comparisons to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION. He generates impressive bat speed and leverage from the right side of the plate, and already understands that he doesn't have to sell out for power to hit home runs. He does a good job of using the entire field and making adjustments, though he could stand to draw more walks.A below-average runner out of the batter's box, PERSON is closer to average underway and has decent instincts on the bases. He works hard on his defense and has seen most of his action in left field, though he has the arm for right if he can improve his throwing accuracy. He also draws praise for his makeup and intelligence, as he returned home to finish his high school degree and has made the effort to learn GPE.",1
"| Overall:NUMBERPERSON and his outstanding defensive skills have now twice been included in trades. The first was the NUMBER-player deal that sent him from GPE to GPE in July NUMBER. Just over two years later, in November NUMBER, PERSON was sent, along with right-hander PERSON, to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON Conger.A very solid defensive receiver, PERSON moves well behind the plate, with good footwork, a quick release and a strong arm that has allowed him to throw out NUMBER percent of would-be basestealers throughout his career. His glove has carried him through the ORGANIZATION and it's what should get him to the big leagues soon. He's not completely lost at the plate, with a line-drive stroke, a little gap power and a tendency to make contact.Right now, he profiles best as a solid, glove-first, big league backup. If the bat can develop, he has the chance to be a defensive-minded regular down the road.",0
"GPE was viewed as a bit of wild card heading into the NUMBER Draft after PERSON surgery had wiped out his entire senior season at GPE (Ariz.) High. Intrigued by GPE's upside, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the third round and convinced him to sign for $NUMBER,NUMBER, $NUMBER,NUMBER less than his pick value. But the right-hander experienced numbness in his arm and hand when he got back on the mound, prompting surgeons to treat him for thoracic outlet syndrome by removing one of his ribs to alleviate a pinched nerve. When his symptoms failed to improve, the right-hander had a nerve removed from his elbow.Finally healthy in NUMBER, GPE showed the promise that had made him a high pick while reaching full-season ball for the first time. His fastball sat between NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touched NUMBER, with good plane and sinking action that makes him difficult to barrel. GPE also flashed plus with his power curveball, which registers at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with tight spin and late bite, and his feel for his changeup improved as he worked deeper into the season.Staying on the field will be crucial in GPE's future development, as he had logged just four pro innings prior to NUMBER. He's big and physical, with a frame built for eating innings, as well as stuff that could make him a No. NUMBER starter or late-inning reliever once fully developed.",0
"PERSON dominated PERSON hitters in GPE, then was quickly moved to Hi-A Port Charlotte, where he has continued to mow through PERSON hitters, striking out NUMBER% of them during his first dozen appearances. He's doing most of his damage with the fastball, which is puzzling because PERSON's fastball doesn't seem remarkable in any way. He'll touch NUMBER, but sits mostly NUMBER-NUMBER with average underlying components like spin, and extension. And despite that, PERSON is getting a lot of swinging strikes in the zone with his fastball. His arm slot is slightly below three-quarters and creates a tough angle on his heater, which he locates at the top of the zone with consistency, but it's not such a unique look as to satisfactorily explain this level of dominance. The supporting cast -- a quality, low-NUMBERs curveball, rare cutter and changeup --  is fine, but there's no clear out pitch among them. We think that could limit PERSON's ability to go deep in games as a starter, and that it's more likely that he fall into an NUMBER-inning sort of long relief role, like a righty PERSON of sorts.",0
"â¢ NUMBER/NUMBER: PERSON optioned to Triple-AVanderbilt has been a veritable first-round pitching factory over the years and PERSON was the latest, going No. NUMBER overall in NUMBER, the seventh ORGANIZATION arm to be taken since NUMBER, dating back to when the ORGANIZATION last took someone from the school (PERSON). PERSON made quick work of the Minors, reaching the big leagues in his first full season, though he pitched sparingly out of the bullpen, then having mixed results as a starter in brief big league looks in NUMBER.The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER right-hander has a four-pitch arsenal and outstanding delivery that point to a future in a big league rotation soon. He can touch the upper-NUMBERs with his fastball, sitting in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, and has shown the ability to maintain that velocity deep into his outings. He still has two distinct breaking balls and while his slider at its best might be superior to his curve, it's the latter that's more consistent. He throws his above-average changeup with excellent deception and movement.The only thing that hasn't completely lived up to advanced billing has been his control and command. It might be average, or a tick below, at present, but because his delivery works so well, there is every confidence he will find greater strike-throwing consistency, allowing him to reach his potential as a frontline starter.",1
"PERSON was a bit of an afterthought as a prospect after he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER. He spent his first four seasons between the ORGANIZATION and Short-Season levels before advancing to full-season ball in NUMBER and breaking out with PERSON en route to PERSON of the Year honors. He took home the award again the following season while finishing the year in Double-A, prompting the ORGANIZATION to add him to their NUMBER-man roster. He did miss time early in the NUMBER season due to a strained left forearm, though it didn't keep PERSON from earning midseason All-Star honors in the LOCATION after finally taking the field in June. PERSON stands out most for his natural hitting ability, as he's an advanced left-handed hitter with a mature approach and a clean, repeatable swing that generates hard contact from line to line and gives him utility against same-sided arms. He has some pop, too, albeit mostly to the gaps, but the ORGANIZATION believe he'll eventually clear more fences once he becomes comfortable turning on the ball and letting the barrel fly. Though he's proved serviceable in left field, PERSON' below-average speed and athleticism is better suited for first base at higher levels. He lacks the power to profile as an everyday big leaguer there but has enough feel to hit and on-base to serve as a future bench option for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON began to blossom during his introduction to full-season ball in NUMBER. He encored with a solid performance in Class A Advanced last year before he joined the ORGANIZATION as part of the ORGANIZATION Dickerson/Jake McGee trade in January.Adding velocity as he has gotten stronger, PERSON worked at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touched NUMBER with his fastball in NUMBER. He shows feel for spinning a curveball that could give him a second plus pitch, and also has aptitude for using his changeup to keep left-handers at ORGANIZATION does a fine job of throwing strikes for a young pitcher, though he could do a better job of commanding his pitches within the zone. If he can continue to build on the progress he has made in the last two seasons, he could develop into a mid-rotation starter.",1
"â¢ NUMBER/NUMBER: PERSON promoted to ORGANIZATION landed PERSON during their NUMBER international bonus-pool-shattering spending spree, signing the then-NUMBER-year-old GPE righty for $NUMBER million in December. Though little was known about him at the time, PERSON looks to be yet another coup for the organization's international scouting department. Behind a combination of physicality and stuff, he continued to climb the ladder in NUMBER, beginning the season in the Class A GPE League and then earning a promotion to Double-A at age NUMBER.A physically large and imposing presence on the mound who operates from a three-quarters slot, the NUMBER-foot-NUMBER PERSON can generate plus-plus velocity with ease, though inconsistent mechanics can cause his velo to fluctuate. When he's right, he'll sit in the mid-NUMBERs and touch NUMBER mph. His best secondary pitch is an upper-NUMBERs slider with two-plane action that flashes above-average potential, and he'll also show feel for a curveball and changeup, with the latter projecting as the better pitch.Repeating his delivery and pounding the strike zone is something PERSON does better than most hurlers of comparable size, but he does struggle at times to keep his long limbs in sync and throws with too much crossfire, resulting in diminished stuff and below-average fastball command. More consistency on that front and improving his secondaries could help PERSON become a mid-rotation starter, and some evaluators view the hulking right-hander as a future closer.",1
"The ORGANIZATION' first selection in the NUMBER Draft, GPE has struggled to get on track as a professional. Though his upside is all about his bat and, more specifically, his power, he hasn't had much success thus far. Still just NUMBER years old, if he can develop into an average hitter, and there's hope he can in time, then he has the chance to have plus power down the road, as he has a lot of raw pop to tap into. He's close to an average runner down the line, and there's hope he can be an average defender in left field. But it's his offensive upside that will move him along in the organization.",0
"The ORGANIZATION lost their top two picks in the NUMBER Draft as compensation for free-agent signings, making PERSON their top selection in the third round. He was a part of three GPE state championship teams at ORGANIZATION McCarthy High School, the same school that produced big leaguers PERSON and PERSON. While he had mixed results during his NUMBER full-season debut with PERSON before wearing down late and finishing the year on the disabled list, PERSON has proven to be more durable this year in his second tour of the LOCATION. While he's not overpowering, PERSON has seen an uptick in his fastball velocity since Spring Training and is now bumping NUMBER-NUMBER mph while sitting comfortably in the low NUMBERs. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER left-hander creates a good downhill angle to the plate that gives his heater late life and makes him difficult to lift. His secondary offerings lag behind his fastball at the moment, though he does have good feel for a changeup and gets good depth to his curveball.PERSON still has gains to make both with his control and command, but he has the size and pitchability to develop into a quality back-end starter at the highest level, especially if his stuff continues trending in the right direction.",0
"The lefty out of GPE went from the Class A Advanced California League to the big leagues in his first full season. He had relieved in college, worked as a starter to begin his pro career, then threw very well out of the bullpen in the big leagues. His ultimate role is still up in the air. He has the stuff to start, with a fastball that has deception and a very good slider when his mechanics are right. He throws a changeup, though it's below-average, and if he stays in relief, he won't need it. Some don't love his arm action and worry about his durability - he did miss time with a strained lat in NUMBER. That, plus the lack of a trustworthy third pitch has some thinking he should just stay in the bullpen. If he doesn't win a bullpen spot in GPE Training, he could go down to Triple-A to continue working on his secondary stuff.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"As a young GPE right-hander who's smaller and has a thicker body type, PERSON draws the inevitable comparison to fellow ORGANIZATION hurler PERSON.

It certainly seemed possible after he made a successful jump to Double-A in NUMBER, finishing second in the organization in batting average against, third in ORGANIZATION and fourth in strikeouts. He moved up to Triple-A in NUMBER and didn't have the same level of success, but his stuff remains good. He has the chance to have three at least above-average pitches. His fastball and changeup are already there, the latter a must in the ORGANIZATION organization, as all young pitchers work with offspeed artist PERSON. His slider can get slurvy at times, but if it comes, that'll give him three NUMBER's on the scouting scale. He does need to improve his command, especially down in the strike zone. At worst, he's a really good bullpen guy, but he has a good chance to start, something the ORGANIZATION were saying about PERSON at exactly the same part of his development.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"GPE posted promising strikeout and walk rates in the early part of his career and then suddenly began hitting for power in NUMBER and NUMBER at ORGANIZATION before returning to career norms in NUMBER. On paper, GPE was very intriguing as a young pro because he played shortstop and had such terrific control of the strike zone, but eyeball evaluations were more generic, indicating a bench role at best, and were incongruous with GPE's performance, especially when he suddenly had power. He was sidelined for much of NUMBER after he was struck by a pitch on the foot, but he put enough balls in play to note that his pull rate was up and his ground ball rate was down, and a hitter with this kind of innate talent would suddenly become very interesting if a swing change were to coax out some more power. At NUMBER, GPE is probably just an up/down utility type, but that's also what we thought about PERSON at this time last year.",0
"PERSON was PERSON's male athlete of the year in NUMBER after starring in four sports at FACILITY (Calif.) High, but lasted NUMBER rounds in the Draft that June in part because he had a poor junior season on the diamond. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER, he led the Rookie-level PERSON with NUMBER homers in NUMBER but struggled in low Class A during NUMBER and the beginning of last year. He got going again following a second-half promotion to high Class A, batting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER homers in NUMBER games, then went deep four times in NUMBER ORGANIZATION contests. PERSON always has shown impressive bat speed and leverage from the right side of the plate, and his considerable raw power began to translate into game production once he began controlling the strike zone better last summer. He still gets too aggressive at the plate, and some scouts think he's more of a mistake hitter than someone who will thrive against better pitching.After splitting time between left and center field in his first three years as a pro, PERSON played almost exclusively in left during NUMBER. He's not quick out of the box but has average speed once he gets going, and he has worked hard to increase his arm strength from well below average to fringy. He worked out at first base during the ORGANIZATION and could get more action there in the future.",0
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION out of GPE in NUMBER, ORGANIZATION made a promising pro debut in NUMBER before missing the next two years with injuries and getting released in May NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION signed him in February NUMBER after he threw NUMBER-NUMBER mph during a tryout, but he made just one start in low Class A that May before injuring his elbow and requiring PERSON surgery. He returned in NUMBER and showed enough during NUMBER brief regular-season starts and instructional league to claim a spot on GPE's NUMBER-man roster in November, then made his big league debut seven months later.While ORGANIZATION is small and skinny, he has surprising power to his three-pitch repertoire. His quick arm repeatedly generates NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastballs that top out at NUMBER with life down in the strike zone. His low-NUMBERs curveball features a high spin rate and his upper-NUMBERs changeup has nice fade, albeit with a bit too much velocity at ORGANIZATION has a clean delivery that he repeats well, allowing him to work the bottom of the strike zone and be stingy with walks. His stuff and control give him a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter, though his size and health history are concerns. He pitched scoreless ball in two of his first three starts with GPE but came down with shoulder inflammation after his fourth.",1
"GPE of a ORGANIZATION Jays NUMBER international class that provided plenty of trade fodder, PERSON signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE and went to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal four years later. He starred in low Class A immediately after switching organizations, but his delivery fell apart the following spring and he went NUMBER-NUMBER with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA at two Class A stops in NUMBER. His fortunes suddenly reversed again last year, where he embraced changes to his mechanics, finished strong and earned a spot on GPE's NUMBER-man roster.PERSON's best pitch is his fastball that usually ranges from NUMBER-NUMBER mph and tops out at NUMBER with sink. He has a pair of power breaking balls, with his curveball and slider both plus pitches at their best but also inconsistent. He's making strides with his changeup though it still ranks as his fourth-best pitch.PERSON's downturn came when his delivery became too violent, causing him to fall off toward first base and lose any semblance of command. He has cleaned up his mechanics, taking a more direct route to the plate and doing a better job of locating his pitches. Though the ORGANIZATION will continue to develop him as a starter, he could have success as a late-inning reliever with a power arsenal.",0
"A NUMBERrd-round pick by the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION prep ranks, PERSON was a two-way player at the ORGANIZATION of LOCATION in NUMBER before signing with the GPE for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a ninth-rounder. He took off after making some delivery adjustments, and then continued to climb the ladder in NUMBER, moving up to Double-A and becoming an LOCATION All-Star. PERSON's progress caught the eye of the ORGANIZATION, who acquired him and second baseman PERSON for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION. PERSON was suspended NUMBER games after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance in March.PERSON can run his fastball up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph but usually sits more in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. Though not overpowering, PERSON's heater plays above its velocity on account of his deception, allowing him to induce whiffs inside the zone. He has good feel for his curveball, showing the ability to throw it for a strike and also bury it in the dirt when vying for whiffs, and he's adept at adding and subtracting with the pitch as needed. His changeup gives him a third average-or-better offering, albeit one he uses sparingly, and he has good command of all three pitches.Because he lacks a plus pitch and thrives based on deception, PERSON will have to prove himself at each level. He has handled every challenge so far, and while he's not a top-tier prospect, the left-hander has a legitimate floor as a backend starter in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE's fastball attracted scouts when it climbed into the low NUMBERs during his high school senior season in NUMBER, but his velocity dropped into the mid-NUMBERs as the ORGANIZATION approached and he fell all the way to the NUMBERth round. He repeated PERSON ball and battled shoulder issues in his first two years as a pro, then started to emerge in NUMBER before breaking out as organization's best lefty pitching prospect in NUMBER. He led the system in wins (NUMBER) and strikeouts (NUMBER in NUMBER innings) while conquering two Class A leagues.GPE's fastball has bounced back, now sitting in the low NUMBERs. His heater plays up because of its cutting action and the effectiveness of his plus fading changeup, which he throws with the same delivery. He shows some feel for spinning the ball, though his curve is often fringy at best.He helps his cause by filling the strike zone and keeping his pitches down. However, his control and command haven't been as sharp in NUMBER as they were when he averaged NUMBER.NUMBER walks and NUMBER.NUMBER homers per nine innings in his first four pro seasons.",0
"Rather than sign with the ORGANIZATION, who took GPE in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft, GPE returned to PERSON for his senior season, and it's looking like it may have been a good move for the right-hander.A strong, durable workhorse type, GPE will mix four Major League average or better pitches. His fastball may top out at around NUMBER mph, but it seems faster thanks to an above-average changeup that's a legitimate weapon. Add in a sharp slider and a curve that shows sign of being a usable second breaking ball and you have the makings of a solid middle-of-the-rotation-type starter.The new Draft rules led to teams taking a lot of college seniors in the early rounds a year ago, and it stands to reason it will happen again, something that could work in GPE's favor.",0
"It's hard to argue with what PERSON has been able to do thus far in his ORGANIZATION career since taking until March NUMBER to sign. The big lefty has struck out NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings over his two seasons in pro ball. The only question has been whether his command and his changeup would improve enough to be a starter for the long-term. He has a fastball that's easily plus, one he can get up into the upper-NUMBERs and sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with regularity. He adds and subtracts from his power curve, which has plenty of break to it. His changeup has improved, giving more hope to his ability to stay in a starting rotation. His long arm path, along with some other issues with his delivery, has led to command problems (NUMBER.NUMBER BB/NUMBER) and that remains the key to his future. At the very least, that fastball-curve combination is more than enough to make him an outstanding short reliever.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"When the PERSON drafted PERSON in the eighth round out of the GPE high school ranks in NUMBER, he was the type of player who looked the part as a physical specimen but was considered raw in all facets of the game, given his two-sport background as an amateur. He took a major step forward in NUMBER, however, when he paced the ORGANIZATION York-Penn PERSON in home runs (NUMBER), ORGANIZATION (NUMBER) and ORGANIZATION (.NUMBER) in his second professional season. He began the NUMBER on the disabled list while recovering from a wrist injury before finally making his full-season debut for Class A Greensboro in late April. But PERSON's time in the LOCATION PERSON turned out to be short lived, as a botched knife prank by roommate PERSON in early June resulted in a right thumb laceration and subsequent surgery.Though PERSON has long possessed impressive strength and bat speed, his stiff swing limited his production during his pro debut. The PERSON helped him clean up his mechanics last season, and it allowed him to hit for a higher average while tapping into his plus raw power more consistently. PERSON still needs to tighten his approach and improve his pitch recognition, as cutting down his strikeouts and continuing to increase his walk rate will only make him more dangerous at the plate. PERSON spent all of NUMBER in center field, though it remains to be seen if he can remain there long term. He's an above-average runner with enough range to handle all three outfield spots, but with below-average arm strength, he's more likely to end up in left field if he's unable to stick up the middle. PERSON will have to show that the progress he made in NUMBER can transfer to full-season ball and up the ladder, but the early signs of improvement certainly are encouraging.",0
"PERSON was shortstop as an amateur in GPE, but he moved behind the plate after signing with the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER. He underwent PERSON surgery in NUMBER and then stalled out for several years in mid-Minors before finally making his big league debut in 'NUMBER. PERSON returned to PERSON last July and appeared in six games for GPE before it sent him to GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION trade.PERSON stands out for his consistent bat, which has produced a .NUMBER-plus average at the Triple-A level over parts of three seasons. He's a switch-hitter who makes a lot of line-drive contact from both sides of the plate and uses the whole field. PERSON has below-average power and has tallied double-digit home runs just once in his pro career.PERSON is an average defender who's cleaned up his receiving skills as he's progressed through the Minors. His athleticism shows up in blocking ability, while his average arm strength plays up thanks to his consistent footwork and quick release. PERSON will have to make even greater strides at the plate to profile as an everyday catcher in the big leagues, but he has the defensive chops and the contact skills to be a quality backup.",1
"PERSON was more polished than most high school hitters, and GPE happily took him with the sixth overall pick in NUMBER. Injuries limited him somewhat in his first full professional season, but he made up for the lost time with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION, where he was the second-youngest player.PERSON has a loose easy swing, and he sprays line drives to all fields. He is an aggressive hitter, but he doesn't strike out a ton, thanks to his feel for the bat. PERSON has more power than his lithe frame would suggest, and he projects to have average power. He is an excellent center fielder, and he has a strong arm.PERSON has five-tool potential, and his makeup and baseball instincts allow his tools to play up. If he can avoid further injury troubles, he has the skillset to start moving quickly.",1

The ORGANIZATION native graduated to full-season ball in NUMBER, earning mid-season All-Star honors in the Class A ORGANIZATION at age NUMBER.PERSON's live arm generates easy velocity in a fastball that consistently sits between NUMBER-NUMBER mph with late life. His slider registers in the mid- to high-NUMBERs, thrown with late, short slicing action, and he also has the makings of an advanced changeup that he's already comfortably deploying against right-handed hitters.There are concerns about PERSON's ability to create downhill plane given his height, but, so far, he's shown that he can keep the ball in the park. Meanwhile, he should be able to tack on strength to his wiry frame as he matures physically, which should in turn improve his durability. PERSON has the arsenal and control profile to develop into a big league starter, although his fastball-slider pairing also give him a bright future as a reliever, one who can get outs on both sides of the plate.",0
"While the island of GPE made big Draft headlines in NUMBER with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick (the ORGANIZATION' PERSON) and the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick (the ORGANIZATION' PERSON), PERSON was the top PERSON in the Class of NUMBER and has a chance to join PERSON and PERSON as impactful big leaguers soon, even if it takes him a bit longer to fully develop.The NUMBER PERSON has the chance to have a very good three-pitch mix. Tall and projectable, he could add to his low-NUMBERs heavy fastball that already generates a ton of groundball outs. He knows how to spin a breaking ball, throwing a solid curve with good rotation and bite. His changeup has improved, though it remains behind the other two offerings. His command has improved and he's shown a good overall feel for pitching.PERSON showed tremendous mental toughness pitching through the NUMBER season while his young son was very ill. That, along with the strides he has made since being drafted, has the ORGANIZATION confident he can be a starting pitcher at the big league level.",1
"A member of the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER international signing class that also included fellow hard-throwing right-handers PERSON and PERSON, PERSON took off in NUMBER.

He now throws in the mid NUMBERs and can reach NUMBER mph with the pitch. He commands his fastball well and creates groundballs thanks to its natural life. His changeup is his best secondary offering, while his slider remains a work in progress. After a breakout campaign, PERSON has the stuff to start moving quickly toward the ORGANIZATION. He'll need to continue to develop his secondary offerings to reach his potential as a frontline starter.",1
"PERSON entered NUMBER as one of the better high school prospects in GPE, but a broken ankle suffered while playing PERSON and his Stanford commitment dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBERth round. He played mostly right field for the ORGANIZATION and some third base during summer ball, and the ORGANIZATION made him a second baseman in his first full season after he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as an eighth-round pick in NUMBER. They moved him back to the outfield in NUMBER, and he has hit wherever he has played.PERSON has a knack for hitting line drives and uses the opposite field well, though he doesn't contribute much offensively beyond his batting average at this point. He makes contact so easy that it cuts into his walk totals and on-base percentages. He has the bat speed and strength to hit NUMBER homers per season but will need to add some loft to his right-handed stroke and turn on more pitches to realize his power potential.A good athlete for a NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pounder, PERSON has solid speed and arm strength. He made a lot of progress in his first year at second base, showing reliable hands and the ability to turn double plays. But with a logjam of infield talent, PERSON decided to return him to the outfield, where he has seen action at all three spots this year.",1
"It took a while to get it all confirmed, but the ORGANIZATION are extremely pleased they were able to officially sign PERSON in July NUMBER. For providing a false date of birth, PERSON wonât be able to play in games until July NUMBER, NUMBER, but PERSON is more than willing to wait while he works out at their academy in the ORGANIZATION. The outfielder has all the attributes scouts love in young prospects, with plus bat speed, plus raw power and a projectable body. While he has the speed to play center, he might end up in right with his plus arm when he fills out completely, with some seeing him potentially as a future PERSON type of player.",0
"PERSON comes from a football family, as his grandfather PERSON, father PERSON and uncle Kris all played professionally. PERSON was the LOCATION's freshman of the year and batting champ (.NUMBER) in NUMBER after cracking ORGANIZATION's lineup midway through the season, and he has continued to ignite the ORGANIZATION from the top of the batting order this spring. His numbers haven't been as gaudy in NUMBER, in part because he broke his left hand on a slide in early April and kept playing despite the injury.A switch-hitter, PERSON focuses on making contact and using his speed -- which earns double-plus grades down the line -- to get on base. He has good hand-eye coordination but needs more selectivity to be a true tablesetter, and his approach yields very little power. His quickness doesn't play as fast on the bases and he has much to learn before becoming a basestealing threat.PERSON's wheels allow him to cover a lot of ground in center field and he'll definitely remain there at the next level. His arm is more than strong enough to play anywhere in the outfield. His fastball has been clocked as high as NUMBER mph when he has pitched out of ORGANIZATION's rotation at times this year.",0
"A senior sign reliever coming out of GPE, PERSON experienced a velo bump in his second pro season and also developed better movement separation between his curveball and slider, which has enabled both of them to play better. He still only sits NUMBER-NUMBER but he gets way, way down the mound and generates about NUMBER feet of extension, causing his heater the jump on hitters more quickly than they expect. His fastball is also spin-efficient and has plus vertical movement. He's gone from elder org filler to back of the rotation prospect in half a season.",0
"After drafting prep sluggers PERSON and PERSON early in the NUMBER Draft, the ORGANIZATION took a more frugal approach in subsequent rounds. In the fourth, they took PERSON, a senior from ORGANIZATION, and signed him for just $NUMBER,NUMBER. But after a quick ascent of GPE's system that culminated with him winning the LOCATION's Most Outstanding Pitcher award in NUMBER, PERSON was dealt with PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON in early January. PERSON has thrown harder as a professional than he did in college, as he'll sit at NUMBER-NUMBER and occasionally bump the mid-NUMBERs, all while throwing strikes and working on a downhill plane. His changeup is his best secondary offering, thrown with excellent deception from his three-quarters delivery, and it complements his the action on his fastball. The left-hander's breaking ball is slurvy and tends to linger up in the zone, though he still has the ability to throw it for a strike. He has outstanding command and generates a good amount of ground-ball outs.PERSON could get to the big leagues quickly as a lefty reliever based on the merits of his fastball-slider pairing and command. If he can add some strength, maintain velocity and develop a more consistent breaking ball, he has a chance to become a mid-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON is the latest prospect hailing from PERSON in GPE, the most recent ones before him being Cubs NUMBER fifth-rounder PERSON and PERSON's older brother PERSON, who went on to LOCATION. This younger PERSON was nabbed in the fifth round and given an above-pick value bonus of $NUMBER,NUMBER to not head to PERSON advanced high school hitter with a compact left-handed swing and all-fields approach, PERSON employs more of a line-drive stroke at present, which has not led to much power to date. He does have the bat speed and strength to get to at least average power once he learns to lift and turn on pitches more frequently. PERSON moves well and was an excellent defender at first base. As a pitcher, he touched the low NUMBERs with his fastball, giving him a stronger arm than your typical first baseman, perhaps a reason why the PERSON sent him out to play left field during his pro debut.Whether PERSON can stick in an outfield corner remains to be seen, but the Cardinals know he can easily slide back to first if needed. He should eventually develop into the offensive profile desired at either corner spot.",0
"As an amateur at ORGANIZATION, GPE was seen as an fringe-to-average bat with above average power, questionable catcher defense, and arm strength that may push him to first base. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the second compensation round for an overslot bonus, using the pick they bought from GPE in exchange for PERSON's contract. Eventually, and ironically, PERSON traded him to GPE as part of the multi-player return for PERSON and PERSON' O'Day's contract. Since signing, GPE's defense and pop times have improved, due in part to a slimmed-down physique and in part to improved throwing mechanics that make the most of his average arm strength. We think he'll be able to catch part time and also have enough of a bat to contribute at first base, ORGANIZATION, or as a pinch hitter. He's moved down a bit for us since last season as his strong start and improved defense early in NUMBER tailed off a bit later in the season, which is somewhat common for players who are dealing with physical change during the longest full-time catching spell of their lives. Some scouts questioned GPE's bat control and thus his hit tool and game power in late NUMBER looks, so looks early in NUMBER may tell us if this was a slight regression in tools, or just temporary fatigue he can get past. The likely outcome looks like a valuable switch-hitting backup catcher whose bat you want to get in the lineup most days, which we value the same we would a low-end regular.",0
"In many ways, the first half of PERSON's NUMBER season was just like that of GPE righty PERSON, who's now in the overall top NUMBER picture because his stuff exploded late in the year. Like PERSON, PERSON mostly pitched out of the bullpen at a second tier GPE college and only began starting full time in NUMBER. He was probably slightly underscouted as an amateur, and definitely underdeveloped. For a month and a half of NUMBER, he showed mid-rotation stuff, then blew out his elbow and needed PERSON. He may not be back in affiliated ball until late next summer, but he was quite young for a college draftee (another trait he shares with PERSON) and has more developmental wiggle room for a setback like this than most of his peers would. He's a NUMBER ORGANIZATION breakout candidate.",0
"PERSON comes from a baseball family, with a father and uncle who both played at LOCATION. His dad went on to coach at his alma mater and at ORGANIZATION, while his uncle spent NUMBER years in the ORGANIZATION. The younger PERSON jumped on the map as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, scuffled as a sophomore, but bounced back with a strong junior season, hitting NUMBER home runs and while pacing the ORGANIZATION in batting (.NUMBER), hits (NUMBER), ORGANIZATION (NUMBER) and slugging (.NUMBER). A dearth of college catchers further pushed him up teams' Draft boards, and the ORGANIZATION were pleased to find him available ahead of their third-round pick. The switch-hitting backstop swung the bat well in the second half of his junior season, using an advanced approach at the plate to hit for average and power while drawing a ton of walks. It's a power-over-hit profile from both sides of the plate, though some question whether PERSON will hit enough at the next level to tap consistently into that raw pop. His defensive game, however, lags behind his bat. The big-bodied catcher lacks agility behind the plate, with blocking, receiving and catch-and-throw skills that leave something to be desired. PERSON catching is always hard to find, and PERSON did it for three years at ORGANIZATION. His bat is his calling card to the ORGANIZATION and gives him a chance to develop into a offensive-minded backstop if can also make gains on the other side of the ball.",0
"GPE was on the brink of making the ORGANIZATION back in NUMBER as one of the most exciting left-handed pitching prospects in baseball, but has backslid since. While he reached Triple-A in NUMBER, he lost some of his feel for pitching and his command dissipated considerably. He made just six starts in NUMBER and eventually needed, and had, PERSON surgery. He'll miss the NUMBER season as a result, but he's still young enough to bounce back and reclaim the buzz surrounding him. When he's healthy, he has the chance to have three above-average pitches in his fastball, curve and changeup and has shown the ability to have average command in the past.",0
"For the first three years of his ORGANIZATION career, PERSON was an athletic shortstop. With his bat not developing as hoped, PERSON gave pitching a try and within two seasons was pitching out of the Double-A Bowie bullpen, making a brief Major League debut in June.The more time PERSON spends on the mound, the better he gets. He has plenty of arm strength, throwing his fastball in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, using a sidearm motion and getting lower as he gets more comfortable. It's a heavy ball with hard sink, one that generated a NUMBER.NUMBER groundout-to-airout ratio in NUMBER. He complements it with a hard slider and even throws a serviceable changeup. The one thing that had held PERSON back had been his command, walking NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings entering NUMBER. Thanks in part to his athleticism, he made considerable gains on that front in NUMBER.PERSON has gone from being a stalled prospect in A ball to a reliever pitching at the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION system. With continued refined command, he could end up as a right-handed setup man in a big league bullpen.",0

An imposing NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds, GPE has a four-pitch mix at his disposal. He will work consistently at NUMBER-NUMBER mph, and he reaches as high as NUMBER with his fastball. His best secondary pitch is his slider, a low-NUMBERs breaker with some bite. He also uses a curveball and a changeup.He's still learning to repeat his delivery and locate his pitches consistently, but there aren't many left-handers who can match his velocity. If his command comes enough, he has the chance to be a top-of-the-rotation-type starter in the future.",0
"PERSON hit NUMBER mph with his fastball and flashed a hammer curveball as a high school senior in NUMBER, yet he lasted until the second round of the ORGANIZATION because the consistency of his stuff and command wavered. Six years after he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER, that often remains the case. He dominated in the first three months of NUMBER in high Class A but has rarely done so since coming down with a sore elbow that June.Though PERSON led the Double-A LOCATION with NUMBER victories and worked a career-high NUMBER innings in NUMBER, he recorded just seven quality starts in NUMBER tries. He has looked better this year, continuing to maintain the velocity on his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball while doing a better job of imparting life and locating it. His curveball has been sharper, his changeup has been more effective and he'll mix in an occasional cutter.Even when he has premium stuff, PERSON gets hit harder than he should because he doesn't command his pitches. He missed chunks of the NUMBER and NUMBER seasons with elbow and forearm inflammation and has frustrated the ORGANIZATION at times with his lack of dedication. He worked harder last offseason than he had in the past and has been more aggressive on the mound, which paid off with him finally making his big league debut in June.",1
"The only player ever drafted out of PERSON, an ORGANIZATION II college in GPE, PERSON signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER. He broke out in NUMBER by swatting NUMBER homers to rank fifth in the Minors, though he didn't hit for much average and struggled after a late promotion to Double-A. PERSON addressed both of those concerns in NUMBER while progressing from late-round/small-school curiosity to a more legitimate prospect. He has done a better job of using the whole field and keeping his swing from getting too long without sacrificing his considerable power. After playing primarily at second base in NUMBER, PERSON has returned to his more natural position of third base. His strong arm fits well at the hot corner, and his lack of quickness is less of a liability.",1
"A starter throughout his career since signing for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as a second-rounder in NUMBER, PERSON got summoned to GPE as a reliever last August. He posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER innings and earned a spot on the ORGANIZATION Championship Series roster, though he was left out of the World Series to make room for PERSON. The key to his success in NUMBER was coming up with a cutter that kept hitters from sitting on his fastball.PERSON lacks a plus pitch, and while his fastball and changeup can be solid offerings, they also lack consistency. He throws both two- and four-seam fastballs, ranging from NUMBER-NUMBER mph and sitting around NUMBER. In the big leagues, he mostly abandoned his changeup in favor of his cutter, which generates groundouts, and his curveball, which lacks depth but had surprising success in a small sample size. PERSON's crossfire delivery gives him deception and is tough on left-handers, but it also hurts his control and command. He could wind up as a back-of-the-rotation starter or a middle reliever, filling whatever role the ORGANIZATION need a lefty in just like PERSON did for five seasons before departing as a free agent. A lat strain cost him most of May and June this year, however.",1
"It seems that, after his velocity yo-yo'd throughout college (probably due to inconsistent usage) and early as a pro, PERSON' fastball has settled in NUMBER-NUMBER range. It just means he'll have to pitch off of his secondaries more, the best of which is a tilting, NUMBER-to-NUMBER curveball that spins in at about NUMBER rpm. PERSON will throw the curve in the zone for strikes or bounce it in the dirt to his glove side. He can also create good angle in on righties with what looks like a cutter.

PERSON hasn't progressed as quickly as his sibling because shaky command has limited his effectiveness.All three of ORGANIZATION's pitches can elicit swings and misses when he can steer them close enough to the plate to elicit swings. He can carry a mid-NUMBERs four-seam fastball into the late innings and reach NUMBER mph as a starter, though it's fairly straight, which has led him to fiddle with a two-seamer as well. He has a hard three-quarters breaking ball that would be more effective if he got ahead in the count more often to set it up, and a circle changeup that he should use more often.The Dodgers are trying to smooth out ORGANIZATION's mechanics to help him locate his pitches more efficiently. They still haven't given up on him as a starter, though the gulf between his stuff and his pitchability may point him to the bullpen.

His best secondary offering is a hard slider that arrives in mid-NUMBERs.PERSON has the athleticism and tall, strong build to make it as a starter, though he'll need some refinement. His curveball and changeup lag behind his other two pitches, and he doesn't have much experience using the changeup. His control and command also will have to improve.",0
"PERSON was a little under the radar entering the spring, but continued to hit, play a solid second base and show off his plus plus speed to where he's a low-risk college bat with positional value.",0
"PERSON is an imposing physical presence in the batter's box and has the body of work to back it up. While injuries derailed his first year in full-season ball, his bat has earned him a place in the ORGANIZATION' next wave of young prospects.  PERSON has a smooth swing that is geared to hitting line drives from gap to gap. He has a good feel for hitting and solid raw power to go with it. As he matures, he may grow into even more power. Originally signed as an outfielder, his below-average arm and speed forced him to move to first base. He's a work in progress there, but has the tools to become an average defender in time.  PERSON earns praise for his makeup and work ethic. He'll need to hit to keep advancing, but that shouldn't be a problem.",0
"It can sometimes be difficult for a ORGANIZATION II player to get noticed. That was not a problem for PERSON, though, as he put himself on the map with an All-Star season in the ORGANIZATION last summer and then continued to dominate in the spring, going NUMBER-NUMBER with eight complete games and three shutouts in NUMBER starts to help PERSON advance to the ORGANIZATION II Championship Tournament. One of NUMBER finalists for the PERSON, presented annually to the nation's top ORGANIZATION II pitcher, PERSON signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER after the ORGANIZATION selected him in the sixth round.PERSON is all about command, one who walked just NUMBER and struck out NUMBER in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings during his regular season last spring. The right-hander's fastball sits right around NUMBER mph but plays up thanks to his ability to move it to all quadrants of the zone. His slider is his best offering, thrown with short, late biting action, though it's not a huge strikeout pitch for him. His fringy curve is used more as a get-me-over pitch for strike one or as a chase pitch out of the zone with two strikes. He has feel for a changeup, but doesn't use it much.While PERSON has outstanding arm action and repeats his delivery well, a general lack of movement has some thinking he might end up in long relief. However, the ORGANIZATION will give him every opportunity as a starter, with the hope that he can develop into a solid back-of-the-rotation piece.",0
"PERSON offered more fastball velocity than any college pitcher in the NUMBER Draft, which helped him become the highest pick ever out of PERSON (Calif.). The ORGANIZATION II school that has produced seven big leaguers, including PERSON and PERSON. A second-round choice, PERSON signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER.Without expending much effort in his delivery, PERSON can sit at NUMBER-NUMBER mph as a starter and has reached triple digits while working as a reliever. He ultimately may end up in the latter role because the rest of his game pales in comparison to his fastball.PERSON will flash a solid curveball and a decent changeup, though both pitches lack consistency. So does his ability to throw strikes and command his pitches. There are no glaring flaws in his delivery, yet he struggles to locate his offerings.",0
"As an extremely projectable athlete with raw offensive ability and a high ceiling, ORGANIZATION was a natural fit for the ORGANIZATION. They drafted him in the second round last June and signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million. The ORGANIZATION high school product struggled to adjust to the speed of the pro game in his debut, though that was expected.Once ORGANIZATION gains strength and experience, GPE believes he'll hit for average and power. He has a quick bat, helping him overcome a hitch in his right-handed swing, and manipulates the bat head well. He has the patience to draw walks and the speed to steal a few bases.ORGANIZATION has the quickness and arm strength for shortstop, but his hands and actions may not be suited for the middle infield. He played more at third base during his debut and almost exclusively there in his first full pro season. He could handle center field if he can't stay on the dirt.",0
"Selected in the sixth round of the NUMBER Draft, PERSON was named the ORGANIZATION of the Year in NUMBER after he posted a .NUMBER OPS with NUMBER hits, NUMBER runs, NUMBER home runs and NUMBER steals in NUMBER games between Class A Quad Cities and Class A Advanced Lancaster. He began NUMBER back in the GPE, where he hit .NUMBER with NUMBER home runs in NUMBER games, but his power dropped off considerably after moving up to Double-A. In GPE, the ORGANIZATION traded PERSON to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION Gomez/Mike Fiers deal, and he spent two weeks on the shelf in late August with an irritated nerve in his thumb.PERSON has a short, compact swing from the left side that produces hard contact across the whole field, though he does have a tendency to get pull happy. He won't hit as many home runs as he moves up the organizational ladder, but the bat and approach are good enough for him to offer average power at maturity. PERSON' above-average defense and cannon arm are fits in either center or right field, and he split time between both positions in NUMBER. Though he'll have a chance to remain up the middle, some scouts think he's better suited for right field long-term. Though he's struggled this year in his return to the Double-A level, PERSON' above-average speed gives him an intriguing blend of power, speed and hitting ability, the combination of which could make him a dynamic top-of-the-order hitter.",1
"PERSON was considered a pitching prospect in high school, but he hurt his shoulder and moved to the outfield at FACILITY. He hit NUMBER home runs his junior year and the ORGANIZATION made him a third-rounder in NUMBER. PERSON showed how far he has come as a power-hitting outfielder in his first full professional season, leading all ORGANIZATION Leaguers with NUMBER home runs at ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON. PERSON has impressive right-handed power and drives the ball to all fields. He has improved his approach at the plate, but there is still a lot of swing-and-miss in his game. He is a good athlete with solid speed that plays well on the basepaths. PERSON has a strong arm and is a prototypical right fielder.",0

He has always had the actions and arm to stick at shortstop, and his plus speed plays well on the bases. He has a solid left-handed swing and uses the whole field to hit. He showed the ability to add some strength this spring and will continue to need to add more muscle as he moves up the professional ranks.A rare high school shortstop who will no doubt stay there, PERSON has the chance to one day become an elite-level talent at the premium position.",0
"A two-way standout in high school, PERSON only wanted to hit at the next level, and the ORGANIZATION were more than happy to oblige. PERSON's best tool is his plus raw power, and he tapped into it enough during his pro debut to set an ORGANIZATION record for home runs. He takes a good amount of walks, but he also strikes out a great deal and will have to cut down on the swing and miss to consistently hit as he moves up the ladder. A pitcher who hit the mid-NUMBERs in high school, PERSON has a plus arm at third, but whether he'll be able to stay there long-term defensively remains to be seen.",1
"After he shook off some initial rust in NUMBER, PERSON's stuff and strike-throwing quickly flourished, enabling him to post a NUMBER:NUMBER strikeout to walk ratio at Low-A Fort Wayne. His fastball was in the NUMBER-NUMBER range, and his changeup was consistently plus or better all summer. A back issue put PERSON behind during NUMBER spring training, and while the ORGANIZATION sent him to Hi-A in late-April, his stuff and command were just not as good as they were the year before. Instead of NUMBER-NUMBER, PERSON's fastball was more NUMBER-NUMBER, and his walk rate tripled. We're in wait-and-see mode with PERSON now. He had a mid-rotation look in NUMBER, but fourth starter stuff and fringe command last year. After sitting NUMBER-NUMBER early in the spring, PERSON was shut down with shoulder inflammation. In early May, he was again NUMBER-NUMBER with his trademark changeup.",0
"An NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER who signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER, PERSON first put himself on the map in 'NUMBER, when he was among the leaders in the rookie-level GPE League in a host of pitching categories. He further raised his profile in his first full season, posting a NUMBER-NUMBER record and NUMBER.NUMBER ERA over NUMBER starts at ORGANIZATION A Columbia to earn a promotion to the ORGANIZATION State League. That lasted only two starts, however, as PERSON was shut down in late June with an elbow injury that required PERSON surgery in GPE, costing him all of NUMBER.A strong and physical right-hander, PERSON will impress with his combination of present stuff and plus control when healthy. His fastball will sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with riding life to it, and he commands it so well that the pitch usually plays above its velocity grade. He has feel for spinning a breaking ball, throwing a curve that will flash above average at times and a slider he'll mix in occasionally, while his changeup, already an effective weapon against lefties, could become his best secondary pitch with more refinement. He's missed plenty of bats and is an extreme strike-thrower, with career rates of NUMBER.NUMBER K/NUMBER and NUMBER.NUMBER BB/NUMBER.PERSON' recovery and rehab was going as planned during Spring Training, and he was expected to open NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION State League before he required a procedure to address an ulnar nerve issue in his reconstructed right elbow. It pushed back his return until late June, when he finally took the mound in a Gulf Coast League game, only to land back on the injured list shortly thereafter. The good news is PERSON will be NUMBER for most of the season, underscoring how he has plenty of time to get back on track and reach his ceiling as a No. NUMBER-type starter.",0
"Baseball development isn't always a straight path and sometimes prospects need to take a step back to move forward. That seems to be the case with PERSON, who wasn't ready for full-season ball in NUMBER, righted the ship after a move back to the Rookie-level Appalachian League, then handled the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER by finishing ninth in batting average and tied for third in stolen bases. He jumped on the fast track in NUMBER, moving up to Double-A early in the season and even making his big league debut in May, and then joined the ORGANIZATION in December with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON as part of the ORGANIZATION trade.While PERSON could stand to refine his approach and draw more walks, especially since he profiles as a top-of-the-order type hitter, he does have a knack for making consistent hard contact. He doesn't have over-the-fence power, but PERSON has enough strength to hit the gaps. From there, his speed allows him to take extra bases and he should become a more efficient basestealer as he progresses. PERSON is an elite-level defender in center field, the kind who regularly makes highlight-reel plays, and he has a plus arm to boot.Seeing a young player show they can bounce back after struggling, that they can demonstrate and learn from adversity, is important in development. That skill, along with his natural tools, has allowed PERSON to make progress up the ladder.",1
"PERSON made name for himself during his NUMBER stateside debut in the ORGANIZATION, where he showed a promising blend of hitting ability and speed. He moved up to ORGANIZATION A Hagerstown the following year and emerged as a GPE ORGANIZATION All-Star while finishing second in the Minors with NUMBER stolen bases. PERSON suffered a broken finger during the first week of the NUMBER season that cost him much of the first half, but finished on a high note at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Potomac and has continued to make strides this season in his first Double-A campaign. PERSON's double-plus speed is easily his top tool and gives him impact potential on both sides of the ball. He's always a threat to run when on base, a notion supported by his NUMBER-plus steals over parts of five Minor League seasons, and he's long showed the ability to bunt for a hit. Defensively, he gets good reads off the bat and covers a ton of ground in center field.PERSON's combination of plus speed and defense gives him a solid floor as a fourth or fifth big league outfielder, though he may very well surpass that projection given his progress in recent years. With a more refined approach and better on-base skills, PERSON has the potential to hit atop the order.",0
"PERSON was a star high school running back, but unlike many two-sport prospects playing baseball, his game isn't flashy or out of control. PERSON's blood runs cold and he always looks comfortable at the plate. His approach to contact is pretty conservative and he lets the strength and umph in his hands generate his in-game power, much like PERSON. He also has a great eye for the striek zone, like PERSON. PERSON's arm may limit him to left field.",0
"In NUMBER, PERSON became the first black LOCATION to sign a professional baseball contract. He has steadily progressed through the ORGANIZATION and developed into a prospect. PERSON is an excellent defender at shortstop with soft hands and a strong arm. His bat, however, is still a work in progress. PERSON has quick hands and a good approach at the plate, but still struck out NUMBER times at high Class A ORGANIZATION last year. He is a plus runner and is a threat on the base paths. PERSON's defense will allow the ORGANIZATION to be patient as he develops offensively.",0
"PERSON put on a power show at the ORGANIZATION of GPE in June, tying one record with two homers in a game (including one estimated at more than NUMBER feet) and setting another with three total at the event. He's built for power with a big, strong frame and plenty of bat speed. His reputation preceded him at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October, where few pitchers dared to challenge him. PERSON has a mature approach at the plate and is willing to take walks when he doesn't get strikes. His arm, which has been clocked in the low NUMBERs both on the mound and from the outfield, gives him a third solid-or-better tool. He's a below-average runner but moves well enough to have a chance to play an outfield corner. A product of the ORGANIZATION program that has produced big leaguers PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, PERSON has committed to GPE.",0
"ORGANIZATION stood out early in his high school career outside GPE, ORGANIZATION as a regular on the showcase circuit who was often the best player on the field at high profile events while also being the youngest. He had mostly solid average tools and good feel through the middle of his prep career. Then in his senior year, the arm strength, raw power, and bat speed all became plus, and he was the odds on favorite to go first overall. But PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, and fellow GPE prep hitter PERSON all took steps forward in the spring, and the ORGANIZATION were able to get ORGANIZATION third overall. 
In pro ball, ORGANIZATION has benefitted form the ORGANIZATION' affiliates being extreme hitters' environments, which has mostly obscured in the surface stats the fact that ORGANIZATION pitch selection is below average. It improved a bit in his second taste of Double-A in NUMBER, then became an issue again in his late-season promotion to Triple-A. He's fringy at shortstop and as a runner, so most scouts see him sliding over to second base long-term, but he's good enough to play shortstop everyday if a club doesn't have better options and focuses on shifting and positioning around him. There's enough here that it's likely ORGANIZATION is a solid everyday player of some sort in NUMBER, but he may not be the star that some have anticipated.",0
"PERSON has impressed scouts with his raw power and arm strength since high school. He turned down the ORGANIZATION as a fifth-round pick in NUMBER to play both ways at ORGANIZATION State PERSON before signing as a third-rounder in 'NUMBER. He homered NUMBER times in NUMBER games over his first three pro seasons, leading the Double-A PERSON in doubles (NUMBER) while ranking second in extra-base hits (NUMBER), total bases (NUMBER) and slugging (.NUMBER) in NUMBER.PERSON delivers power to all fields, though he does so more with strength than bat speed and has an aggressive, pull-happy mentality that also yields a lot of strikeouts. He could hit NUMBER-NUMBER homers per year in the big leagues, though he most likely won't offer much in the way of batting average or on-base percentage.More of a DH and first baseman in college, PERSON has worked hard to become a decent defender at third base. He has a cannon arm and soft hands, though his lack of speed and first-step quickness limit his range. He's blocked at the hot corner in GPE by one former first-rounder (PERSON) and the presence of another (PERSON) dictated that PERSON return to Double-A for the first half of this year.",1
"An alumni of the gold-medal winning NUMBER and under GPE National Team last summer, PERSON is an athletic shortstop with a chance to stay at the premium position.A strong performance at the ORGANIZATION Invitational this spring further helped his ORGANIZATION stock. The ORGANIZATION of GPE commit is a switch-hitter with a projectable body. He's a better hitter from the left side, and while he doesn't have power right now, he does have room to add strength. Still, his best offensive tool will be his speed, which plays well on both sides of the ball. He has the range, hands, arm and instincts to remain at shortstop as well. His defense is ahead of his offense right now, but there is projection in his bat.PERSON won't be the first high school shortstop taken, but he's played his way into early-round consideration.",0
"At NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER, PERSON would look out of place in a team photo of big league first basemen, full of big-bodied mashers and explosive rotational athletes. He lacks prototypical first base pop but there's a non-zero chance he makes enough contact to balance the offensive scales sufficiently to profile as a platoon NUMBERB/LF or low-end regular. His NUMBER post-draft showing in the ORGANIZATION was impressive from a bat-to-ball standpoint and he took great at-bats and made hard contact during instructional league, though that was all against pitching comparable to what he saw in college. He's a sleeper bat we like but it's a tough profile, one he'll have to hit his way to.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON finished his GPE debut the next year as the youngest everyday player in the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League. He built on that success during his full-season debut, earning midseason All-Star honors in the LOCATION League before moving up to the ORGANIZATION. The NUMBER season featured even more accolades for PERSON, as he garnered All-Star honors in his return to the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER before moving up to Double-A and earning his first big league callup in September at age NUMBER. PERSON' performance earned him a spot on the ORGANIZATION' playoff roster, and he gained even more experience after the season in the ORGANIZATION. The entire year had primed PERSON to contribute even more in NUMBER, though his season was quickly derailed when he suffered a hyperextended left elbow in his fourth game of the season. After three months on the shelf, PERSON returned to action in July.PERSON possesses off-the-charts athleticism as well as five standout tools that he showcases on a daily basis. He has the makings of plus hitter from the right side of the plate, with a compact but explosive swing and a present feel for using the whole field. His power played consistently in NUMBER thanks to a more leveraged swing and better pitch selection, and the result was a career-best NUMBER home runs and NUMBER extra-base hits across three levels. PERSON' approach and strike-zone judgment are also mature, while his tendency to hold his ground in the batter's box has led to high hit-by-pitch totals throughout his career. A plus-plus runner, PERSON impacts games with his wheels on the bases as well as in center field, where he has exceptional range and instincts as well as arm strength that's among the best in the Minors at the position.From his athleticism to his immense physical tools and his baseball savvy, PERSON has the makings of becoming a true franchise player for the ORGANIZATION, one who has the upside of a perennial All-Star and possibly an ORGANIZATION candidate.",1

He has a smooth left-handed swing, recognizes pitches easily and manages the strike zone well. Though he employs a line-drive, all-fields approach, his hitting ability, bat speed and strength could translate into average power.A catcher before he hurt his shoulder, PERSON played left field in his pro debut. He's a decent athlete for his size but has below-average speed and arm strength, so he's likely to wind up at first base, where he played as a redshirt junior for the Lions. PERSON tried him at third base during instructional league, but his tools don't fit there.",0
"All PERSON did at FACILITY A&M was perform. He was one of the top hitters in the college game, with a good swing from the left side and the ability to hit line drives to all fields. He'll occasionally show some leverage and loft, but power isn't a huge part of his game. With decent speed, his baserunning instincts allow him to take extra bases and steal some bags. PERSON's arm from the outfield is a plus, the best in the GPE class, and he has decent range. He's played center field during his pro debut in the GPE system, and his offensive skillset profiles better if he can stay there. If it's determined that his range is a bit short, he does have the arm for right, though he doesn't have the power profile usually desired for a corner outfield spot. Wherever PERSON plays, his ability to hit, run, throw and play the game with plus instincts should help him move quickly.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",0
"Since his first round selection in NUMBER, PERSON has bounced around to three orgs. He was part of the package PERSON acquired from GPE for PERSON, then part of the NUMBER PERSON trade with GPE. PERSON between these trades have been several trips to the disabled list, including two consecutive seasons with time lost to hamstring issues. PERSON has had injury issues every season dating back to his senior year of high school, and his fastball, which already plays down due to a lack of extension, was slower than usual during his brief big league debut with the ORGANIZATION last year. He profiles as a No. NUMBER starter, but we've rounded him down due to unavoidable concerns about his ability to stay healthy.",0
"Originally drafted by the PERSON after pitching largely as a reliever at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, ORGANIZATION was part of the mega-trade between the ORGANIZATION and PERSON last November. As a pro, ORGANIZATION has started, and he might have the chance to stick in a big league rotation one day. He can run his fastball up to NUMBER mph with an above-average slider and developing changeup. He's shown an ability to sink the ball for groundball outs and is always around the strike zone. At the very least, ORGANIZATION should be a good power bullpen arm if starting doesn't work out.",0
"Every Draft class has a fair share of prospects who make a name for themselves the spring of their Draft year. PERSON is a prime example of a ""pop up"" guy from the LOCATION high school ranks.The big lefty, who is committed to ORGANIZATION, had scouts running to PERSON a little later than usual thanks to some sharper stuff. PERSON was clocked up to NUMBER mph with his fastball, up a few ticks from his past readings . His secondary stuff, while improved, still doesn't match his arm strength and his fastball. But PERSON shows some feel for his changeup, and there is some projection to his breaking ball. His stuff plays up a bit because of some deception, though there is a little bit of effort in his delivery.PERSON might be a bit of a project, but this kind of arm strength from the left side is bound to intrigue many teams, especially considering how the big southpaw continued to impress most of the spring.",0

Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER, he can't match PERSON's defensive ability but has shown more with the bat.GPE has a long track record of producing at the plate that extends from high school and GPE national NUMBER-and-under teams to the ORGANIZATION and PERSON. He consistently barrels balls with a short right-handed swing and generates good pop for a middle infielder. His advanced on-base skills fit well at the top of a batting order.Though he has fringy pure speed, GPE runs the bases well. While he's not flashy or rangy at shortstop, he has dependable hands and makes routine plays. Second base is probably his best position, and GPE had him play some third base alongside PERSON at short-season Vermont.",0
"PERSON made a name for himself when he won the home run derby at the NUMBER Perfect Game All-American Classic, beating out note prep sluggers such as PERSON and PERSON.

PERSON consistently makes hard contact, though some evaluators wonder if he's already physically mature and how well the uppercut in his right-handed swing will play against more advanced pitching.Though PERSON is beginning his pro career at his high school position of shortstop, he lacks the range to play there at upper levels. Some scouts believe he's quick enough to play second base, while his strong arm and power potential would profile well at third base.",0
"PERSON GPE has sent NUMBER pitchers to the big leagues since the turn of the century, and PERSON is talented enough to add to that total. An unheralded recruit out of GPE (Mo.)

PERSON led the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts (NUMBER) as both a sophomore and junior (NUMBER) before going to the ORGANIZATION in the fourth round -- where the club had taken rookie left-hander PERSON two years prior. PERSON lacks consistency, with the quality of his pitches and even more with his command, but when he's on, he can display impressive stuff. He can pitch at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with a fastball that has reached NUMBER mph and features some run and sink, and he can back it up with a sharp mid-NUMBERs slider. But there also are times when PERSON's heater and slider lose some power and flatten out.PERSON has yet to show much feel for a changeup and also possesses a curveball that isn't as reliable as his slider. He starts slow with his delivery before speeding up his tempo, which leads to him getting out of sync and struggling to locate his pitches. While PERSON has been a durable in college and will get the chance to develop as a starter in pro ball, his ultimate role may be as a high-leverage reliever.",0
"Originally signed by the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON began turning heads by hitting NUMBER mph with his fastball when he made his GPE debut three years later. But he also struggled to refine his secondary pitches and his command, and GPE shipped him to the FACILITY in July NUMBER as part of a three-team trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. Despite missing two months in NUMBER after having meniscus surgeries on both knees, PERSON took a huge step forward in his development. He pitched well at Double-A in NUMBER and made his big league debut in September before being traded to the ORGANIZATION as part of the three-team deal that sent PERSON from GPE to the FACILITY in December.PERSON continues to bring the heat, working at NUMBER-NUMBER mph, peaking at NUMBER and imparting some sink and cut on his fastball. His mid-NUMBERs slider can reach NUMBER mph and be a well above-average pitch at its best, though it also flattens out and gets hittable. PERSON, he can show feel for a changeup with fade at times but have the pitch look like a batting-practice fastball at times.Built more like a young PERSON than his generously listed weight of NUMBER pounds would suggest, PERSON has cleaned up his delivery and done a better job of throwing strikes since changing organizations. Provided that he continues to make improvements and gains more consistency, he could be a No. NUMBER starter. If he doesn't, he could wind up as a reliever, albeit with the upside of a closer.",1
"PERSON drew mixed reviews from scouts as GPE's closer, with some viewing him as potential late-inning reliever with a power arm and others seeing him as a lefty specialist with poor command and less than explosive stuff. The ORGANIZATION clearly saw enough of the former to make him their third-round selection in the NUMBER Draft.PERSON boasts a plus fastball from the left side, one that will touch NUMBER mph but typically sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. His curveball is an average pitch when he stays on top of it, registering in the low NUMBERs with good shape and depth, and he'll need to develop a usable changeup to avoid being relegated to a ORGANIZATION. PERSON's stuff tends to play up because he has a deceptive delivery and hides the ball well. The effort in said delivery does raise questions about his overall strike-throwing ability, but the fact that he's naturally tough to barrel gives him some margin for error. The ORGANIZATION considered developing him as a starter in NUMBER before ultimately assigning him to a bullpen role with PERSON. It was a decision that could end up paying dividends for the ORGANIZATION sooner rather than later, as PERSON, with his two average-or-better pitches and deception, has greater impact potential out of the bullpen.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have a reputation for polishing throwers into pitchers and have another project on their hands after selecting PERSON from the Rockies in the big league phase of the Rule NUMBER Draft in December. Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, he was one of the hardest throwers in the ORGANIZATION. But he also spent three years in GPE ball and didn't make it to low Class A until NUMBER, which is one of the reasons PERSON didn't protect him.The Rockies clocked PERSON as fast as NUMBER mph and he generates consistent upper-NUMBERs fastballs with little effort. While he has a quick arm, impressive athleticism and little effort in his delivery, he has trouble controlling his heater. When he has to dial it down to throw strikes, it tends to get hit.PERSON also has a powerful slider in the upper NUMBERs but has even more difficulty keeping it in the strike zone. He also has a changeup with similar velocity but it's not very effective and he's more of a two-pitch reliever. Despite his impressive radar-gun readings, PERSON actually has averaged less than a strikeout per inning as a pro and will need to add considerable polish to stick in GPE.",0
"PERSON was a low-profile JC arm the ORGANIZATION gambled on in NUMBER and after improving his body composition entering the NUMBER season, his stuff and command improved too, and he looked like a potential no. NUMBER starter. PERSON's NUMBER season wasn't as good, as his stuff and command were both a bit worse, so he's now at the nexus of back-end starter or depth relief lefty, though the upside of being a starter in the big leagues keeps him ahead of some of the NUMBER FV lefty relievers below (ORGANIZATION and GPE) with similar stuff.",0
"We think the slight uptick in PERSON's walk rate last year could just have been caused by an increased focus on changeup usage. His swinging strike rate took a dip when he reached Double-A despite having two clearly plus pitches: an upper-NUMBERs sinker and a curveball. It's possible the two didn't pair well together and that a better changeup, or a third pitch, will be needed in order to miss bats. PERSON's changeup did improve throughout NUMBER, but he walked more guys; we think that aspect of his profile will bounce back once development isn't coloring his pitch usage. 
PERSON avoided the DL all year after dealing with various injuries during each of the last three seasons. He projects as an above-average big leaguer starter who misses an average number of bats.",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON enough in the NUMBER Draft to give the NUMBERth-round pick out of the LOCATION high school ranks well above the $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus limit for selections made in the NUMBERth round and higher. PERSON surgery in NUMBER slowed him down, but he logged over NUMBER innings in his first true full season in NUMBER and pitched his way to Double-A in NUMBER despite missing more than a month of the season following knee surgery.With a strong and durable frame, PERSON looks like he could be a workhorse the further removed from surgery he gets. He pitched at NUMBER mph with his fastball in NUMBER and touched as high as NUMBER mph on occasion. The rest of his stuff grades out as average at best. He can spin a solid breaking ball, a mid-NUMBERs curve and does have some feel for a changeup. He's around the strike zone with all three pitches, and his command could improve as he's able to log more innings.PERSON has the chance to be a starter long term, with the ceiling of a No. NUMBER or NUMBER, albeit one who could log a lot of innings. The uptick in velocity could mean he would profile well in relief, coming in and throwing in the mid-to-upper NUMBERs in shorter stints, but the ORGANIZATION liked what they saw in his progress as a starter enough to call him up to help out the big league rotation in late July.",1
"The NUMBER college season began with a bang for PERSON, who homered twice off potential No. NUMBER overall pick PERSON twice in GPE's home opener and pushed himself into consideration for the top two rounds. A right wrist injury subsequently depressed his numbers for much of the spring, though he played hurt and helped the ORGANIZATION finish runner-up at the ORGANIZATION. Impressed with his tools and makeup, the ORGANIZATION signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a seventh-rounder.PERSON followed a strong pro debut with a subpar season in low Class A. He has good hand-eye coordination, but his right-handed swing gets long and he chases too many breaking balls out of the strike zone. If he can make contact more consistently, he has the raw power to hit at least NUMBER homers per season and the solid speed to steal as many bases.PERSON has the quickness for center field, his primary position, and the arm to play on either outfield corner. If he can refine his approach and control the strike zone better, he projects as a regular. If not, he still could be useful as a fourth outfielder.",0
"GPE weighed NUMBER pounds and had an NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball as a high school senior in NUMBER, but ORGANIZATION area scout PERSON liked his loose arm and knew he wanted to turn pro. After signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-rounder, GPE didn't reach full-season ball until September NUMBER but broke out last year by leading low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION relievers in strikeouts per nine innings (NUMBER.NUMBER) and opponent average (.NUMBER). He posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA after moving into the rotation in late July, exciting the ORGANIZATION with his potential as a starter, but he went down with an elbow injury that required PERSON surgery after three outings in NUMBER.Texas has a number of intriguing left-handed starting pitching prospects, and GPE has the best breaking ball among them. He can freeze hitters with his plus downer curveball and they also have trouble dealing with his fastball, which sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and peaks at NUMBER. He also throws an average changeup and isn't afraid to use it.Though he's a bit small for a starter, GPE has an athletic delivery. His control and command were a bit scattershot before he made strides in NUMBER, and he cut his walk rate to NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings in his seven starts after averaging NUMBER.NUMBER previously in his career.",0
"The NUMBER PERSON was another one in which the ORGANIZATION didn't have a first-round pick, this time thanks to the free agent signing of PERSON. ORGANIZATION's addition to the system gave PERSON some advanced catching depth, having taken PERSON the year prior. PERSON has since been shipped off to the ORGANIZATION, leaving ORGANIZATION as the top catching prospect in the system. His defensive work is his calling card. He's big and strong, yet athletic behind the plate, with excellent catch and throw skills that allowed him to throw out NUMBER percent of would-be basestealers during his first full season in pro ball. While his glove will undoubtedly get him to the big leagues, how much he'll ultimately hit will determine what his role is. If it all comes together, he'll be an average hitter without much power. Even if he's fringy, he could be a glove-first regular. At worst, he'll be a steady backup for a long time.",0
"PERSON's promising career as a high school quarterback ended when he sustained an epidural hematoma in his head in an off-field accident before his junior season in NUMBER, which led to him spending two weeks in a medically induced coma. He was able to continue playing baseball and went on to GPE, where he was the LOCATION Conference pitcher of the year in NUMBER after fashioning a NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER-inning scoreless streak, the third-longest in ORGANIZATION Division I history. The ORGANIZATION drafted him with their top pick (second round) and signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million. PERSON doesn't blow hitters away, but he keeps them off balance with his ability to change speeds and locate his pitches. He works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reaches NUMBER with his fastball, which plays up because it has some run and sink and he uses his size to create difficult angle. His tumbling changeup can be a plus pitch at times, and he has tightened his curveball into an average albeit inconsistent third offering. A quality athlete, PERSON works both sides of the plate and the bottom of the strike zone. His polish could allow him to advance quickly in pro ball. He has one of the highest floors among PERSON pitching prospects and a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.",0
"The enigmatic lefty came to the Rays from the Royals in the big PERSON trade. The stuff has, and continues to be there for PERSON, but the results haven't. He was demoted in NUMBER and still struggled in Double-A. Perhaps a change of scenery will help, as PERSON still has the potential to throw three above-average pitches with his fastball, slider and changeup. His curve gives him a fourth Major League average pitch. More than anything, his issues have been command and delivery-related. If the Rays can get him straightened out, he still has the tools to be one of the better young left-handers in the game.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"GPE's breakout season in NUMBER led to his Major League debut, where he performed well in a small sample size. He had the chance to earn full-time status but struggled in GPE when given the chance in NUMBER, though he did right the ship in Triple-A despite having to deal with some injury-related absences. The injuries continued in NUMBER, as a dislocated finger suffered while diving into home plate during Spring Training ended his chances of making the D-backs' Opening Day roster.GPE has the tools, the makeup and the approach to succeed at the highest level. He's been a slow starter in the past, and the hope is that's what occurred in GPE last April. A broken toe knocked him out of action and didn't allow him to get into any kind of rhythm. Prior to last year, his hitting ability was steadily improving as he cut his strikeout rate, but the swing-and-miss came back a bit in the big leagues. He has strength, and his ability to re-refine his approach should allow him to tap into his power. A plus runner, he can still improve his basestealing efficiency, and he's shown an ability to use that speed well in all three outfield positions, where his strong arm plays well.Just NUMBER for nearly all of the NUMBER season, GPE could get another opportunity to show he can handle the highest level once he's healthy. He has the tools to be an everyday outfielder. At the very least, he could be an extremely productive fourth outfielder on a NUMBER-man roster.",1
"A two-sport standout in high school who could have played Division I football, PERSON has taken a while to put things together. He broke out in NUMBER, leading the ORGANIZATION in home runs and ORGANIZATION. How much of it was as a result of true development and how much came from a hitter-friendly ballpark in Reading remains to be seen, as the power was still there in NUMBER in Triple-A, but his other numbers regressed.There is no question PERSON has worked tirelessly to turn himself into a baseball player, and not just an athlete playing the game. His bat will clearly define him and he'll have to continue to develop as a hitter -- namely, cut down on his considerable strikeout rate -- to keep finding success. The power is legitimate and the Phillies think it will play in the big leagues if he can better control the strike zone. He can draw walks, but he also strikes out a ton, NUMBER times in NUMBER. PERSON has shown the ability to use the whole field, especially with two strikes, and if he can do that consistently, he has the chance to be an impact hitter. He's become a better outfielder and baserunner, stealing NUMBER or more bases in each of his last three seasons.PERSON didn't quite take the step forward in Triple-A during the NUMBER season, but he still has the run-producing ability to eventually be a middle-of-the-order presence who can change the score in a hurry.",0
"The ORGANIZATION USA Player of the Year as a junior in NUMBER after hitting .NUMBER for PERSON, the ORGANIZATION made PERSON their fourth-round selection in the June Draft. Clearly trying to do too much during his debut, the outfielder scuffled out of the gate, but really turned it on in the second half of the ORGANIZATION season. That success didn't completely carry over to his first full season.When PERSON relaxes, he does what he's always done: hit. He's hit well everywhere he's gone and his second half in GPE allowed him to finish in the top NUMBER in the league in ORGANIZATION. He has an advanced approach at the plate, draws walks and swings at good hitter's pitches. PERSON has below-average power, but there is some extra-base ability with more of a drive-the-ball-to-the-gaps approach. An average runner, he doesn't have the speed to play center field every day and it's unclear if his arm works well enough in right field, giving him a bit of a tweener profile.At worst, PERSON has the skills to play all three outfield spots and could be a valuable offensive contributor as a fourth outfielder. As they continue to deprogram him from his college days, helping him to relax and just let loose, it's possible an everyday corner outfielder could be unlocked.",0
"Entering his senior season at the Harvard-Westlake School (PERSON, GPE) in NUMBER, GPE created split opinions as to whether he was a better prospect as a pitcher or third baseman. By the end of the spring, most scouts liked him more on the mound, and he became the school's third first-round pitcher in the last three drafts, following PERSON (now with the ORGANIZATION) and PERSON (ORGANIZATION).Signed for $NUMBER million, GPE is extremely athletic and projectable, and he could really take off now that he's concentrating on pitching. His changeup is his best present pitch, though his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball could surpass it once he gets stronger and adds more velocity. His slider could give him a solid third offering, and he also mixes in an occasional curveball.GPE repeats his delivery with ease, allowing him to throw strikes and maintain his stuff deep into games. He could have been a sweet-swinging third baseman with gap power and quality defense, but the Cardinals like his chances of developing into a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter.",1
"GPE has been a little tough to figure out. After a strong NUMBER season that saw him pitch very well in the challenging GPE, he struggled up in Double-A before righting himself back down in GPE. He's continued to show the ability to get hitters to swing and miss, with a career NUMBER.NUMBER K/NUMBER ratio (NUMBER.NUMBER in NUMBER), using a fastball that sits in the low NUMBERs, a plus changeup and a decent slider, all with some deception. He made six starts in the ORGANIZATION with mixed results, but he's aggressive on the mound and goes right after hitters, something a team may have seen in GPE that could play well out of a big league bullpen in NUMBER.",0
"After parts of five seasons in rookie or short-season ball, and one on the shelf for a shoulder surgery, PERSON finally made his full-season debut in NUMBER, just a few days shy of his NUMBERth birthday. He came back throwing fire, sitting comfortably in the NUMBER-NUMBER range. An imposing mound presence at a towering NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, PERSON creates extreme downhill plane on his fastball and vertical action on his slider, which aids its vertical depth in spite of a paltry spin rate. He's understandably behind due to his limited pro workload, but he's a candidate for quick promotion before he breaks again, and seems like a potential set-up type if the slider improves now that PERSON is finally pitching and developing again.",0
"GPE can state a claim to being the best outfield defender in college baseball and has a reputation as a gamer who gets the most out of his ability. Where he goes in the ORGANIZATION will depend on what teams think of his bat.GPE starred in his first college season in NUMBER, winning LOCATION Freshman of the Year honors, and then leading the GPE college national team in hitting (.NUMBER) during the summer. But he hasn't hit for as much average or power since, and his strike-zone discipline has regressed. He profiles as a contact hitter with some occasional gap power.GPE has maintained his standard of fine center-field play. He has solid speed and gets great reads and jumps, allowing him to chase down balls from gap to gap. He even has an average arm, which is better than that of most center fielders.",0
"ORGANIZATION spent his first two collegiate seasons at ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION before transferring to GPE as a junior and going unselected in the GPE. He excelled that summer while playing in the GPE collegiate summer league, earning ORGANIZATION honors and breaking the league record for hits (NUMBER), and then built on that performance as a senior by slashing .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER. Impressed with ORGANIZATION's progress and all-around skills, the PERSON made him their sixth-round pick in NUMBER. After a solid first full season at ORGANIZATION A Delmarva, ORGANIZATION got off to a hot start in NUMBER at ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON, earning a promotion to Double-A just a month into the season.ORGANIZATION can do a little bit of everything on the field, most notably hit for average while offering plus defense at shortstop. He's fundamentally sound there, showing good range, soft hands and a strong arm, as well as consistency that has long impressed evaluators. At the plate, ORGANIZATION offers little in the way of power but has a disciplined approach and good feel for hitting to all fields.The PERSON liken ORGANIZATION's abilities to those of former big league shortstops PERSON and PERSON, players who stood out for their sum of all parts rather than specific tools. With further development, ORGANIZATION could reach the ORGANIZATION in a utility infielder role.",0
"After a junior season in which PERSON was among the best power and run-producing hitters in the ORGANIZATION, he was drafted in the ninth round. He opted to return to GPE for his senior season rather than sign with the ORGANIZATION and once again found him on the conference leaderboard for home runs, slugging percentage and a host of other offensive categories.PERSON can hit the ball a long way from the left side of the plate, with a ton of pull power. He is more strength than bat speed, which concerns some, but he did improve his walk rate a tremendous amount during his senior year. A former third baseman, PERSON moved to first base in NUMBER and appears to have found a home there.Not a whole lot has changed from a year ago for PERSON, other than him running out of college eligibility. It's still his bat and power potential that will entice a team to take him as a senior sign.",0
"The label ""future closer"" gets thrown around a lot, perhaps too frequently. But sometimes it's an apt description, as it is with PERSON, the ORGANIZATION' second pick in the NUMBER Draft. PERSON certainly has the stuff to close, as he did at ORGANIZATION. He can run his fastball up to NUMBER mph consistently and sits in the upper NUMBERs with ease. He combines it with a hard diving slider, giving him a second plus out pitch. His command is fringy, and he struggled with the strike zone during his first full season at times. He has the makeup and competitive fire for a back-end-of-the-bullpen guy and wants the ball in pressure situations. The ORGANIZATION typically don't let young relievers pitch the ninth inning only, especially in the lower Minors. So expect to see PERSON pitch anywhere in the last third of the game, even getting multiple innings. But don't be shocked to see him getting the ball in the ninth once he establishes himself in the big leagues if he can prove to be a consistent enough strike-thrower.",0
"Developing high school catching is a tough exercise. When that catcher comes from a cold-weather area like western GPE, even more patience is needed. The ORGANIZATION initially drafted PERSON from PERSON in the fourth round of the NUMBER Draft. He made it to full-season ball in NUMBER, but missed a large chunk of that year with a foot injury. With his bat not developing, PERSON sent PERSON to PERSON in August NUMBER in return for PERSON. He was on the move again after a year with the ORGANIZATION, coming to the A's to complete the ORGANIZATION trade. Things started to click a bit in his first year with GPE and he reached Double-A for the first time, though he struggled once he arrived.A long-limbed, switch-hitting backstop, PERSON stands out more for his work behind the plate than at it. He receives well and has a strong arm that's allowed him to throw out just over NUMBER percent of potential basestealers heading into NUMBER. PERSON started to swing the bat with a bit more authority over the past two seasons and hit well in the GPE League before stumbling post-promotion. He has more of a line drive approach now, but he shows some raw power in batting practice and still has room to add strength. While it's more leverage than bat speed, you can dream on some future pop.The A's would love to see PERSON play with a little more urgency. A slow heartbeat for a catcher isn't a bad thing, but some added energy could help him reach the big leagues as a backup backstop.",0
"The younger brother of former big leaguer PERSON, PERSON signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER and showed promise in the lower Minors before stalling in Double-A in NUMBER-NUMBER. Slated as a fourth outfielder in Triple-A to begin last season, he quickly won a regular job in center field and earned ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION and All-Star honors. He made his big league debut with the ORGANIZATION this May but spent most of NUMBER back in Triple-A, where he was named ORGANIZATION MVP. In GPE, the ORGANIZATION traded PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for right-handed prospects PERSON and PERSON. PERSON started to hit upper-level pitching with more authority once he stopped worrying about hitting for power and focusing on what he does best, using his quick left-handed bat to spray line drives from line to line. He worked with ORGANIZATION League hitting coordinator PERSON to improve his load at the plate and hit a career-high NUMBER homers in NUMBER, matching his career total from his first five pro seasons. That offensive profile fits better in center field, where PERSON has seen more action the past two years. He doesn't have true plus speed but makes plays with his quickness and instincts. He has enough arm strength to play anywhere in the outfield and topped IL flychasers with NUMBER assists.",1
"ORGANIZATION' PERSON stock was largely based on his abilities behind the plate, where he was clearly the best defensive catcher in the NUMBER PERSON class. It was enough for the ORGANIZATION to take him in the third round. He lived up to his defensive billing during his first year-plus as a pro and he produced more offensively during his first full season. PERSON included him as part of the package sent to the ORGANIZATION in late August in return for PERSON Verlander.Few doubt ORGANIZATION' ability to make it to the big leagues on his glovework alone. He is an outstanding receiver who moves well behind the plate and works well with pitchers. His plus arm, a combination of solid arm strength with a very quick release and uncanny accuracy, continues to cut down the running game, to the tune of a NUMBER percent caught stealing rate in NUMBER. While he may never hit for a high average, ORGANIZATION has always had strength and raw power to tap into. He was on time with his swing much more frequently in NUMBER, which allowed him to clear fences more consistently. He helps his cause with a willingness to draw walks.At the outset of his pro career, ORGANIZATION looked like he fit the defensive-minded backup profile perfectly. If he keeps swinging the bat like he did in his first full season, it's easy to see him as a glove-first regular in a big league lineup.",0
"It often takes time for those high-ceilinged, hard-throwing high schoolers to develop into pitchers. For some, it takes longer than others and while GPE fits more into the latter category, there's still a lot to like about the projectable right-hander. Clearly, the ORGANIZATION agree as they re-acquired the player they initially drafted during this past offseason after sending him to the A's in the December NUMBER deal that brought PERSON to GPE. He still has the big arm that made him a big-time prospect in the NUMBER Draft, delivering fastballs that touch NUMBER mph with good movement. His curve can be a bit slurvy, but has the chance to be at least an average power breaking ball. He has good feel for a fading changeup. There is still plenty of time for him to develop his secondary stuff and overall command and become the frontline starter many think he has the potential to become.",0
"PERSON has been an integral part of GPE's offense for three years. This spring, he led the ORGANIZATION in hitting and slugging during the regular season.  PERSON has good bat speed, and when he's timed up, he produces lots of hard contact. But his swing has a tendency to get long, and there will likely always be some swing-and-miss in his game.  PERSON was an outfielder before moving to third base this season. He has handled the position switch better than expected, and he could get a chance to stay at third as a professional. If he returns to the outfield, he profiles best in a corner and can play center in a pinch.",0
"PERSON, who is of GPE heritage, likely would have reached the majors in NUMBER had he not been sidelined with shoulder fatigue in early-June. The injury effectively ended his season, as he was up for one August rehab appearance and then shut down again for the rest of the year. The exact nature of the injury is unknown and it's not clear if PERSON will be ready for the start of spring training. When healthy, PERSON has an effective four-pitch mix led by a fastball that sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER range and will touch NUMBER. PERSON doesn't have precise fastball command and throws a middling ratio of strikes, but he throws hard enough to get away with mistakes in the zone, and his ability to execute his breaking balls -- the slider down and to his glove side, the curveball in the bottom of the zone or beneath it -- gives him a pretty good chance to start. There are clubs that have PERSON evaluated as a reliever either because of the lack of fastball command or due to perceptions about his deilvery and health. If not for uncertainty surrounding his injury, he'd be right behind PERSON on this list as a near-ready mid-rotation arm or dominant NUMBER-NUMBER inning reliever.",0
"PERSON won the home run derby at the NUMBER Perfect Game National Showcase and smacked NUMBER homers while carrying PERSON More High (ORGANIZATION) to the ORGANIZATION state NUMBER-A title the following spring. One of the top power prospects in the NUMBER Draft, he signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as the NUMBERth overall pick. He slammed NUMBER homers in NUMBER games over his first three pro seasons, but he also batted .NUMBER with a NUMBER percent strikeout rate and looked rough behind the plate.PERSON sells out for power, using bat speed, leverage and a pull-heavy mindset to crush balls to left field. That approach yields some impressive tape-measure shots and also a lot of strikeouts. He probably won't ever produce high batting averages, though he does draw enough walks to post respectable on-base percentages.Though PERSON works hard on his defense, he has a long way to go to make it as a catcher. His receiving skills remain raw, as evidenced by his NUMBER passed balls in his first NUMBER pro games. He has solid arm strength but lacks a quick transfer and struggles with accuracy, leading the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with NUMBER errors in just NUMBER games last year.",0
"While any discussion of GPE is mostly about projection, the GPE thought enough of him after his NUMBER GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION that they sent him to the full-season ORGANIZATION in NUMBER at age NUMBER. He may not have taken the league by storm, but the switch-hitting infielder-turned-outfielder did have double-digits home runs and more than NUMBER stolen bases. Heâs still learning how to hit, but has the chance to be a pretty good all-around hitter. If he can add some strength, there might be a little power down the road. If he refines his approach a bit, his plus speed could work at the top of the lineup and as a future above-average defender in center field.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON reached Double-A for the first time in NUMBER and received a brief taste of the big leagues that September. He bounced between Triple-A Syracuse and the Majors last season before taking over as GPE's everyday catcher in late September in the wake of PERSON' season-ending knee injury.Scouts have long viewed PERSON as a plus defender behind the plate, where his athleticism and agility make him an excellent blocker. His pitch-framing and overall receiving skills have steadily improved as he's climbed the ladder, and club officials praise his game-calling. Controlling the running game is where PERSON truly shines, as his advanced footwork and cannon arm have helped him post strong caught-stealing rates throughout his career. PERSON's bat lags behind his defense and he'll never offer much in the way of power, but he does make a lot of contact and has proved difficult to strike out.With his strong defense chops and some hitting ability, PERSON currently profiles as more of a backup than an everyday catcher in the big leagues, thus providing the Nationals with quality depth behind the plate.",1
"A year after signing as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON injured his elbow, and a subsequent medical exam revealed that he was missing a muscle in the rotator cuff of his pitching shoulder. The condition hasn't hampered him, as he has stayed healthy since and had a breakout season in NUMBER that included winning a gold medal with PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Games.Though he has averaged slightly more than a strikeout per inning in the lower Minors, PERSON isn't overpowering. He relies more on mixing four pitches and locating them well, giving him a ceiling as a back-of-the-rotation starter. PERSON's best pitch is his changeup, a major weapon against right-handers, and he can put lefties away with his curveball. His fastball usually sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and can reach NUMBER. He also utilizes a slider.",0
"PERSON received the highest bonus in the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER-NUMBER international class, signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION and coming straight to the GPE for his pro debut. He has spent the last two years as one of the youngest players in his Class A leagues, scuffling early while finishing strong. He recorded a .NUMBER and .NUMBER OPS in the first halves of NUMBER and NUMBER, then improved to .NUMBER and .NUMBER in the second halves.He has shown more offensive and defensive consistency in NUMBER while continuing to showcase the two most important tools at third base. He has a fast bat and well above-average power from the right side of the plate, though interestingly most of his pop presently comes against right-handers. He's improving in his ability to handle breaking pitches and make consistent contact, showing a knack for making adjustments.PERSON's most obvious tool is his plus-plus arm, with one scout projecting that he'd have a NUMBER-mph fastball if he became a pitcher. He has the hands and range to make most plays at the hot corner, though he needs to settle down after making NUMBER errors in each of the past two seasons.",1
"Drafted by the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION as a part of the two teams' NUMBER-player deal in July NUMBER. His progress was slowed in NUMBER by a strained lat that sidelined him for much of the first half, but he has been healthy this year and made his big league debut in April. PERSON throws his fastball in the low NUMBERs, using both sides of the plate effectively. He mixes in a slider and changeup, but lacks a true out pitch. He works around the zone with his whole arsenal and does a lot of little things well, helping him to succeed without premium stuff. PERSON has been a starter throughout his career, but might end up fitting better in the bullpen in the long run. He appeared to be on the cusp of reaching the big leagues before his injury in NUMBER and could soon be ready for his shot.",0
"After missing two full seasons with an elbow injury and eventual PERSON surgery, the ORGANIZATION weren't sure what to expect from the hard-throwing Rice product. All PERSON did was reach Double-A in what amounted to his first full season of pro ball, striking out close to NUMBER batters per inning along the way.PERSON might have the best fastball in the system, and that's saying something given the amount of power arms the ORGANIZATION have drafted of late. He touches NUMBER mph regularly, but he's more than just a thrower. His slider is more of a power slurve, thrown NUMBER-NUMBER mph and it has the chance to be an above-average breaking ball for him. Before he got hurt, PERSON also showed a solid changeup. He lacked consistent feel of it during his first year back, but it has the chance to also be better than average.Command was an issue in NUMBER for PERSON, but that's not surprising for a pitcher who missed so much time, and he's continuing to refresh his memory about the nuances of pitching, like understanding game situations and holding runners on. The ORGANIZATION saw more than enough to add him to the NUMBER-man roster this past offseason and he made his big league debut in June. He gives the organization another reliever with closer potential.",0
"The consensus top-ranked prospect on the NUMBER international market, PERSON landed a $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus as the most expensive of several ORGANIZATION big-ticket signings that summer. After he signed, one club official compared him to a NUMBER-year-old version of PERSON PERSON.Like PERSON, PERSON has huge raw power and fits the right-field profile to a tee. He looked raw but not overmatched while making his GPE debut at age NUMBER. His large, projectable frame is starting to add strength and already generates impressive bat speed and leverage. He shows the makings of plate discipline and pitch recognition, which will increase his chances of fully tapping into his home run potential.An average runner with a strong arm, PERSON can be an asset in right field but must improve the accuracy of his throws. The ORGANIZATION rave about his makeup, lauding him for going back to complete his high school degree in the ORGANIZATION and for making the effort to learn GPE quickly.",0
"PERSON was a known prep prospect that came along slowly at ORGANIZATION with the bat, but has blossomed into a potential everyday option, with the glove to stick there (though it isn't pretty), some feel to hit and the raw power for NUMBER+ homers.",0
"After PERSON impressed the ORGANIZATION with his pull power during a pre-Draft workout at FACILITY in NUMBER, they drafted him in the fifth round and paid him an over-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus. He didn't tear up pro pitching in his first two seasons, though he was GPE's most impressive hitter during instructional league last fall and challenged for the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION home run title when he graduated to full-season ball in NUMBER.PERSON has some of the best raw power among ORGANIZATION farmhands, generating it with considerable strength and solid bat speed. He batted just .NUMBER with a NUMBER percent strikeout rate in his first two years as a pro because he gets overly aggressive, and the length and uppercut in his left-handed swing become more pronounced. He does show some feel for hitting and willingness to use the whole field, and GPE thinks he's on the verge of making more consistent contact.Perhaps too muscled up in the past, PERSON spent a lot of time this season endeavoring to get leaner and more flexible. That should help him at first base, where he has put in the work to improve defensively. He's a well-below-average runner who may never be more than adequate at first, so his bat will have to take him to the big leagues.",0
"While shortstop PERSON was creating buzz running up ORGANIZATION boards as a superior college shortstop, PERSON was more than making a name for himself with as consistent a performance on the mound as any college starter in the country.PERSON has moved around during his college career, starting at ORGANIZATION, moving to PERSON as a sophomore, then moving to the ORGANIZATION and becoming their Friday starter as a junior. He might now have wow stuff, but what he has has been really good in NUMBER, all coming from an easy, simple delivery. He pitches off his fastball, which is a tick above-average sitting in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, and it plays up because of his feel for the strike zone. His slider has been a bit inconsistent, but he's shown it can be a solid breaking ball in the past. His changeup needs some refinement and looks kind of like a hybrid splitter-type pitch.PERSON will need to improve his third pitch to continue to have success at the pro level, but he's raised his stock this spring and has the makings of a solid, innings-eating starter.",0
"GPE bloodlines don't get much deeper than PERSON's. His grandfather PERSON and great-uncle PERSON were All-Stars, the latter with the FACILITY, and his father PERSON was a NUMBER first-round pick by the ORGANIZATION. PERSON takes after his dad, a speedster who topped out in Triple-A, more than his big league relatives, who were sluggers.PERSON has nearly top-of-the-line speed and knows how to use it to bunt for hits, wreak havoc on the bases and chase down balls in center field. He can be a plus defender if he improves his reads and routes, though he'll always have a below-average arm.A switch-hitter, PERSON has a sound swing from both sides of the plate. He controls the strike zone reasonably well but will need to hone his on-base ability to fit at the top of the lineup. He has the strength to drive the ball into the gaps, though at times it works to his detriment when he gets too power-conscious.",0
"An NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER who got $NUMBER,NUMBER to sign, ORGANIZATION first put himself on the map in NUMBER when he was among the leaders in the Rookie-level GPE League in a host of pitching categories. He further raised his profile with a tremendous transition to full-season ball and earned a promotion up to the ORGANIZATION State League. That lasted just two starts, however, as he was shut down in late June with an elbow injury that resulted in PERSON surgery in GPE, which will knock him out for all of NUMBER.ORGANIZATION is a strong and physical right-hander with solid present stuff and the chance to gain as he matures once he's healthy. His fastball will sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with good movement to it, and there could be more in the tank. He can spin a breaking ball, with a curve that is above-average at times and a slider he'll mix in occasionally. His changeup gives him an effective weapon against lefties. He's missed plenty of bats and is an extreme strike-thrower, with a career NUMBER.NUMBER walks per nine innings rate.When ORGANIZATION returns, presumably to start the NUMBER season, he will still be just NUMBER years old. There's plenty of time to get back on track and reach his ceiling as a No. NUMBER type starter.",0
"PERSON was originally on track to finish high school in NUMBER, and would have been one of the oldest prep players in the GPE class. He was able to speed up his graduation and entered the NUMBER GPE, where the ORGANIZATION selected him in the third round. He spent a successful first full professional season with PERSON. PERSON mostly for his power as an amateur, PERSON has shown a more mature approach in the ORGANIZATION. He's a patient hitter, and his feel for the barrel should help him cut down on his strikeouts as he gets more experience against premium pitching.PERSON was a shortstop in high school but quickly moved to third base in the ORGANIZATION. He has the arm strength and hands for the position, but his lack of athleticism limits his range and leads some scouts to believe he'll eventually move to first base.",0
"Another solid college middle infielder drafted and signed by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON had a solid first full season out of GPE that saw him play at both levels of A ball and finish second in the organization in stolen bases. He was off to a decent start at Double-A in NUMBER when he was included in a package sent to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in early June.PERSON does an excellent job of making consistent contact, but his well below-average power makes him little more than a singles hitter right now. He uses his above-average speed well, with outstanding instincts allowing him to be a basestealing threat. Those instincts carry over to his defense, where his average range and arm all play up because he's steady and anticipates well. While he's played some second base, there's no question he can handle shortstop defensively on a regular basis. He does, however, need to get bigger and stronger. If he can do that, he has the chance to be an everyday player. If not, he still should be a valuable utilityman in the future.",0
"Ever since he signed in NUMBER, PERSON has been more about upside and potential than results. What has been a very slow climb through the ORGANIZATION system was halted even more when he needed PERSON surgery after just three starts in NUMBER. When healthy, PERSON has two things working for him: his size and his arm strength. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER right-hander uses his frame to throw downhill, allowing his low-NUMBERs fastball to live down in the strike zone and elicit groundball outs. He can complement his fastball with a curveball that should be a Major League average offering. His changeup is a very distant third pitch and he has struggled with command in the past, something that will take time to return post-surgery. PERSON's rehab was going well and he returned to action mid-summer. A move the bullpen, both to protect his arm and allow his two-pitch arsenal to play up, may be in the offing.",0
"His first-round mate PERSON has stolen most of the thunder, but with the November NUMBER trade of PERSON to the Cardinals in the PERSON deal, he's out from under that shadow. PERSON has started to put injury issues behind him to move up the ladder. A healthy NUMBER season had him on the right path and he followed it up with an injury-free NUMBER in Double-A. He has a fair approach at the plate, one that's improved over time, and started to show the raw power that made him a first-round pick in the first place. There are still holes in his swing and he needs to make better adjustments to breaking stuff, but those things come with the reps he had been missing in the past. He's a solid defensive outfielder with a strong arm and still has the chance to be a good run-producing corner outfielder in the future.",1
"Power-armed righty (up to NUMBER) with three pitches (tailing change, inconsistently-shaped breaking ball) and below-average control. COuld be late-blooming relief option.",0
"A big-bodied corner infielder with easy plus raw power, PERSON heated up as postseason play began and raised his stock. He projects over to first base (where he plays when PERSON is ptiching) but could see time at third base early in his career to see if he can stick. His fluid extension through contact is gorgeous and he has the raw power to profile at first base, but whether or not the hit/power combo will be enough is questionable.",0
"GPE's had an odd career path. He was a high school shortstop and closer, then played second base at LOCATION where he was a good stiatistical performer with the bat during his final two years there. He quickly tumbled down the defensive spectrum in pro ball and was playing first and third base the year before he was moved to the mound in NUMBER, his age NUMBER season. As a pitcher he's been up to NUMBER with a curveball and delivery that make righty hitters very uncomfortable. It's a pretty interesting relief mix considering how quickly it's arrived.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have challenged PERSON at the outset of his professional career, and he has taken some lumps. But PERSON was one of the breakout performers in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, and he still has the skill set to be a solid all-around catcher.PERSON is athletic, which helps him behind the plate as a receiver, and he has a solid arm. He has at least average defensive tools, and he has improved his game calling as a professional.Offensively, PERSON's best tool is his solid power, which allows him to drive the ball to all areas of the park. He has good pitch-recognition skills and has consistently posted good on-base percentages. PERSON looks like a future Major League starter behind the plate, though he's blocked by ORGANIZATION slugger PERSON.",1
"PERSON has the most explosive fastball in the Minors, and he may have the longest medical history as well. An elbow injury that led to PERSON surgery caused him to miss his high school senior season and redshirt during his first year at ORGANIZATION, and he worked just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings and recorded an NUMBER.NUMBER ERA while suffering a torn meniscus and broken hand the next two seasons with the Panthers. After signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a seventh-rounder in NUMBER, he had shoulder surgery to repair his labrum and didn't make his pro debut until NUMBER.A lat injury sidelined PERSON for much of the first half of last season, but he returned to strike out NUMBER batters in NUMBER innings and hold opponents to a .NUMBER average at ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON. His fastball sits around NUMBER mph outing after outing and has been clocked as high as NUMBER, with heavy life making it even more difficult to hit. He backs it up with a mid-NUMBERs slider that can make hitters look silly if they cheat to catch up with his fastball.Besides his health, the other major concern with PERSON is his control. PERSON has toned down his delivery to help in both regards, but he still walked a batter per inning in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION see a lot of parallels between him and PERSON, who overcame a litany of injuries to thrive in the big leagues last year, and PERSON could rush to the Majors if he can stay on the mound.",0
"PERSON has proved to be the advanced hitter the ORGANIZATION hoped he'd become when they signed him out of the ORGANIZATION in December NUMBER. After advancing to full-season ball in NUMBER, PERSON saw his stock skyrocket last season in the Class A Advanced California League, where, as the circuit's youngest everyday player on Opening Day, he won the batting title and ORGANIZATION award at age NUMBER. Moved up to Double-A in NUMBER, PERSON has reaffirmed why scouts view him as one of the ORGANIZATION' more advanced hitters with an All-Star campaign in the ORGANIZATION League.With an approach that belies his age, PERSON demonstrates an advanced feel for the strike zone and has excellent pitch recognition, the combination of which netted him more walks (NUMBER) than strikeouts (NUMBER) in NUMBER. The right-handed hitter's bat-to-ball skills are equally impressive, as his short, level swing produces line drives across the entire field. And while he may never offer much over-the-fence power in games, PERSON should be a consistent source of extra-base hits thanks to his knack for pounding the gaps. An average defender at second base with an above-average arm, PERSON has made a smooth transition to shortstop in NUMBER.PERSON' advanced approach and innate feel for hitting has him poised to become an impact player in the big leagues, while his successful transition to shortstop only increased his value.",1
"The term projectable is used a lot to describe drafted high school pitchers. GPE, who hails from GPE and didn't play a ton of baseball as a result, puts a lot of emphasis on the project part of that word. The ORGANIZATION went after a few prep right-handers in the NUMBER Draft, and they knew GPE was more raw than PERSON and PERSON, but they liked what they saw enough to go well over-pick value to sign him in the NUMBERth round. GPE has the chance to have a big fastball, with above-average velocity, when all is said and done. It currently sits in the low-NUMBERs, touching a bit higher, with more in the tank as he learns to repeat his delivery more consistently. His breaking ball and changeup are still being developed, but they could be Major League-average pitches eventually. He's starting to fill out his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame and has shown good athleticism, things that should help him repeat and develop better command, which is below-average currently.The progress has been slow, but it's been noticeable. The ORGANIZATION knew it would take time and there's been no pressure on GPE to advance. Their patience could eventually pay off a big dividend.",0
"GPE has posted big power numbers everywhere he has gone in the last three years, starting with setting school records at LOCATION CC for batting (.NUMBER) and homers (NUMBER) in NUMBER, when GPE signed him as a fourth-rounder. He topped the Rookie-level PERSON in runs (NUMBER), total bases (NUMBER) and ORGANIZATION (NUMBER.NUMBER) during his pro debut, then encored by winning GPE League MVP honors and leading the Class A Advanced circuit in extra-base hits (NUMBER) and slugging (.NUMBER) during his first full season. He followed up in NUMBER by pacing all Double-A hitters in homers (NUMBER) and the ORGANIZATION in extra-base hits (NUMBER) and total bases (NUMBER).Compared to PERSON for his power and surprising athleticism in a big frame, GPE can knock the ball out of any part of any ballpark thanks to his strength and leverage. His NUMBER-foot-NUMBER build comes with a naturally long right-handed swing that, coupled with his aggressive approach, resulted in a ORGANIZATION-worst NUMBER strikeouts and NUMBER percent whiff rate in NUMBER. He went through five different batting stances during the season as he searched for a way to make more contact, and the ORGANIZATION think he'll be able to do that after reworking his stroke during the offseason.GPE displays average speed out of the batter's box and is a step quicker once he gets going, which enabled him to play center field for the majority of his first three pro seasons. He's an average defender up the middle but better suited for a corner. His strong arm fits perfectly in right field, as does his power profile.",0
"After an unsuccessful attempt to sign PERSON after the NUMBER season, the ORGANIZATION pivoted and used their surplus of international bonus pool money to spend $NUMBER.NUMBER million to land PERSON in March NUMBER. He had starred in GPE's top league as a NUMBER-year-old in NUMBER-NUMBER, then spent two seasons in the independent Can-Am League after defecting. In his first year in affiliated ball, he held his own in the short-season LOCATION and starred in the ORGANIZATION, but he has struggled to make consistent contact in NUMBER.WWith his willingness to work counts and plus speed, PERSON could fit at the top of a big league batting order. To do so, he'll have to curb a tendency to let his left-handed swing get too long when he tries to hit home runs. While he's not a big guy, he generates solid raw power with his quick bat and deceptive strength in his hands and wrists.PERSON has the speed to be an asset as a basestealer and a center fielder, but he's still learning how to make the most of it. He needs to improve his jumps on the bases and in the outfield. He's capable of playing all three outfield spots, though his fringy-to-average arm would be a bit stretched in right.",0
Two-way talent out of PERSON was a coinflip for most teams to hit or pitch. He's been solid as a utility bat but started pitching in NUMBER and now may have a path to ORGANIZATION relevance in a two-way role.,0
"At NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds, PERSON looks like he'd be at home on a football field (he had college football offers to play tight end) or a basketball court (he physically resembles ORGANIZATION star PERSON). As a high schooler, he drew interest as a right-handed pitcher. But PERSON's destiny is to become a slugging right fielder, and his upside landed him $NUMBER.NUMBER million as the NUMBERnd overall choice in the NUMBER Draft. Built along the lines of ORGANIZATION, PERSON has similar strength, leverage and huge raw power. He focused on working counts and the middle of the field during his NUMBER pro debut, but he started to turn his right-handed swing loose more often last season. He has improved his balance, timing and plate discipline in his return to Triple-A in NUMBER, and he could be a higher-average hitter with NUMBER or so homers per season or more of a masher who delivers NUMBER-plus long balls.An excellent athlete for his size, PERSON has average speed and a strong arm. He has spent the bulk of his pro career in right field, but he could play left and fill in in center if needed.",1
"PERSON came out of Miami-Dade Junior College and was initially developed as a starter, a strike-throwing sinkerballer who reached the Class A Advanced PERSON in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION moved him into a relief role in NUMBER and up to Double-A, and he thrived, pitching in the last third of the game with consistent success. While PERSON doesn't rack up strikeouts, he is up into the upper-NUMBERs as a reliever, with a ton of sink that has led to big groundout/flyout ratios. His curve flashes plus at times as well and he throws strikes. With PERSON's newfound role, the right-hander should be ready for a big league bullpen in the near future.",0
"Pitchers don't come much skinnier than the NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound GPE, who may not be as projectable as that build might indicate because he's already NUMBER. His long levers allow him to throw on a steep downhill plane and wide angle, but they also make it hard for him to repeat his delivery and consistently control his stuff.GPE can miss bats with his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball and mid-NUMBERs slider, though he sometimes struggles to throw them for strikes. His changeup isn't as effective.GPE will have to prove he can hold up over a full season, something he couldn't do in NUMBER or NUMBER. He had an oblique injury and blister issues in two years ago and back problems last season, totaling just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings during that span.",0
"PERSON became the sixth PERSON drafted in the first round and the first in nine years when the ORGANIZATION selected him NUMBERth overall in NUMBER. He didn't spend much time in the ORGANIZATION system, however, as he was a part of the package sent to GPE for PERSON in December NUMBER. PERSON' stock had gone down since he was drafted, but his strong season while repeating Double-A PERSON this year has restored some of his prospect sheen. PERSON stands out most for his athleticism. He has well above-average speed and covers a lot of ground in center field. Offensively, PERSON has the tools to become a prototypical leadoff hitter. He has a line-drive approach and uses his speed to his advantage. PERSON is still just NUMBER, giving him time to reach his potential.",1
"Since his high school days and through his collegiate career at ORGANIZATION, PERSON has tantalized with his physical presence and his raw tools. Injuries have somewhat limited him from reaching his upside potential as a pro. PERSON was off to a very good start in his first full season in NUMBER and was likely about to be promoted out of the ORGANIZATION when an GPE injury forced him out of action for all of NUMBER games in the summer's final two months. Surgery on his elbow - an issue that affected him in college - kept him from getting work in at instructs as well. PERSON's tools are considerable, particularly his raw power, but he hasn't been able to translate it consistently into games. If he can learn to make adjustments, that would help him fit the profile of a corner outfielder, one with decent speed and a strong arm. PERSON is praised for his work ethic and makeup and that could help him reach his ceiling, something that could help him make it from potential to performance consistently.",0
"After beginning his college career as a swingman at Louisiana-Lafayette, PERSON' transition to the rotation as a sophomore had mixed results. That prompted to a full-time move to the bullpen as in junior in NUMBER, a role in which PERSON thrived. He struck out NUMBER batters and yielded just NUMBER hits in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings to lead all Division I hurlers in both strikeouts-per-nine (NUMBER.NUMBER) and hits-per-nine (NUMBER.NUMBER). That overwhelming success earned him a NUMBERth-round selection by the A's in June, and after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER, PERSON continued to miss bats with ease across two levels in his pro debut. PERSON gets the most out of his two above-average pitches, missing bats inside and outside of the zone easily with each. He won't shy away from challenging hitters up in the zone with his low-NUMBERs fastball that he can also spot to both sides of the plate. His curveball is a hammer when it's on, registering in the low NUMBERs with tight spin, and it serves as an ideal bat-missing complement to his fastball. PERSON has a strong track record as a strike-thrower, but he'll need to improve his fastball command for continued success at higher levels.Though he started seven of his NUMBER games during his pro debut and has pitched almost exclusively in that role with PERSON in NUMBER, PERSON' future is likely in the bullpen. His fastball-curveball combo gives him upside as a high-leverage reliever, and with improved command of both pitches, he could hop on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"When PERSON was taken by the ORGANIZATION out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in NUMBER, it was as a bat-first catcher, one who hadn't spent that much time behind the plate. By the time they sent him to the Phillies in the ORGANIZATION deal in July NUMBER, there were no longer as many questions about his ability to stay behind the plate. PERSON has an excellent arm that has allowed him to throw out NUMBER percent of would-be basestealers in his career. He moves and blocks fairly well, though there's room for improvement there. At the plate, he has very good raw power and can drive the ball to all fields, though there have been some issues with his setup, including wrapping his bat, that haven't allowed him to be as consistent as he has the potential to be. Throughout NUMBER, PERSON struggled with the effects of a concussion, which eventually forced his season to come to an end in early August.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON is an enigma, as a massive righty that throws three above average pitches at times and can run his sinker into the mid-NUMBER's, but he was jerked around by his coaches this year, is a lower energy player that doesn't always respond well to adversity and the secondary stuff and command came and went at times. PERSON came on down the stretch and there's buzz he could go in the top NUMBER picks to the right team.",0
"GPE won't wow you with tools, but he's the type that just goes out and gets the job done. The one thing he's shown he can do is hit. He makes a ton of contact, rarely strikes out, draws walks and looks like he should be able to continue hitting for a high average. He's the perfect No. NUMBER type hitter, one who can move runners, hit-and-run and hit when behind in the count. He makes the plays defensively without much flash. He played second base in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER and many feel that he'll eventually slide over there permanently and become a very solid everyday big leaguer on the right side of the infield.",1
"May is on the way to becoming the third big leaguer in his family, following his grandfather PERSON and great-uncle PERSON, whose power made them All-Stars. PERSON's tools are similar to those of his father PERSON, a NUMBER first-round pick of the ORGANIZATION who topped out in Triple-A. May reached that level in NUMBER, though he scuffled while battling an early-season oblique injury.One of the best athletes in a system loaded with toolsy outfielders, May is a switch-hitter whose game is built around plus-plus speed. He has some strength and hit eight homers in NUMBER games at ORGANIZATION A during his NUMBER pro debut, but he has focused more on making contact since and went deep just four times in NUMBER-NUMBER. He's more effective from the right side of the plate and will need to draw more walks to fit at the top of a big league lineup.May has the speed and instincts to create havoc on the bases, and he stole NUMBER bases in May NUMBER before he sustained a concussion after colliding with teammate PERSON while chasing a popup. His quickness also helps him in center field, where he has improved his route-running since entering pro ball. His arm is below average but not a liability in center.",0
"One of the top high school hitting prospects in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON lasted until the sixth round because of signability concerns, and he turned down a substantial offer from the ORGANIZATION to attend ORGANIZATION. PERSON failed to hit .NUMBER in his first two seasons with the Cavaliers but took a step forward in the ORGANIZATION last summer, cutting down on his strikeouts and leading the best summer college circuit with a .NUMBER on-base percentage.Before he got to show how much that would carry over, PERSON went down with a broken hamate bone in his right hand NUMBER games into the season. He did return after six weeks and homered in his second and third games back. He has shown more pop at ORGANIZATION than he did with wood bats on the GPE, and he projects as a plus hitter in terms of both average and raw power.",0
"PERSON pitched exclusively out of the bullpen during his college career, first at GPE (GPE) JC and then at ORGANIZATION, before going to the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft and signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER. PERSON enjoyed immediate success as a reliever at the outset of his pro career, only to have the ORGANIZATION shift him to the rotation in mid-NUMBER. The right-hander took quickly to the new role, and the ORGANIZATION acquired him along with PERSON and PERSON from GPE in exchange for PERSON that offseason. After beginning his first season in the ORGANIZATION system with PERSON, PERSON received a well-deserved promotion to Double-A in May. PERSON pitches with both a four- and two-seam fastball, the latter of which sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph, at times a few ticks higher, with late arm-side life that nets him a lot of weak contact. His slider and changeup receive average grades from evaluators, with many preferring the latter to the former given how it plays off of his heater. PERSON also has feel for a curveball in the upper NUMBERs, though it serves as more a change-of-pace offering as opposed to a swing-and-miss, put-away pitch. He throws strikes with all four pitches, albeit with command that leaves something to be desired.An athletic right-hander, PERSON repeats his delivery well and creates some deception with his three-quarters slot and cross-fire finish. He misses his share of bats but doesn't project to do so as frequently at higher levels, as many evaluators forecast PERSON as a future back-end starter who relies on pounding the zone and generating weak contact.",0
"The PERSON household was well represented in the NUMBER Draft, with brothers PERSON and ORGANIZATION both going to the ORGANIZATION. But while PERSON may have been the more highly touted prospect and a first-round pick, it's been ORGANIZATION, a NUMBERth-round pick out of ORGANIZATION, who has had the better pro career. He followed a nondescript first full season with an absolutely massive breakout campaign in NUMBER, hitting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER homers, NUMBER doubles and NUMBER RBIs as he ascended from PERSON to Triple-A Durham, earning a ORGANIZATION Game selection along the way.Behind improved bat speed and a looser, more athletic swing, PERSON showed that he could drive the ball over the fence to the biggest part of any park while still exhibiting a discerning eye at the plate. After profiling as more of a hit-over-power guy early in his career, the hulking left-handed hitter has learned how to tap into his plus-plus raw power and turn on the ball with consistency without it detracting from his impressive feel to hit and overall strong approach that nets him walks and fuels his on-base skills. PERSON's well-below-average speed limits him to first base, though he's a solid defender and makes all the routine plays.PERSON's newfound power and dependable left-handed bat could go a long way in helping him become an everyday first baseman in the big leagues. A platoon role remains a possibility, although PERSON's improvement against same-sided pitching in NUMBER suggests that he might be able to avoid such relegation.",1

He dropped to the sixth round in the GPE, where the ORGANIZATION grabbed him. PERSON returned strong and pitched well during his professional debut. He doesn't have overpowering stuff but knows how to get the most out of his tools. His changeup is his best pitch, and his above-average command allows his whole arsenal to play up. His advanced understanding of his craft could allow him to advance quickly in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The Aâs continue to aggressively pursue talent in GPE and they think PERSON has the chance to be a pretty exciting table-setter one day. He made his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, mostly playing right field alongside B.J. PERSON. And while he didnât hit like he did during his debut in the ORGANIZATION, the Aâs feel he has the chance to be a solid hitter, one who has shown an understanding of what his game should be, getting on base and running. He wonât have the power profile to be a prototypical right fielder, but he may man a corner with PERSON in center as they move up the system together.",0
"PERSON went from a high schooler taken with the final pick (NUMBER,NUMBERth overall) in the NUMBER Draft -- a reflection more of signability than ability -- to a third-rounder in NUMBER after three years on a loaded GPE pitching staff. The ORGANIZATION had four arms taken in the first four rounds last year, another who went in the first round in NUMBER and two more who could go in the first round in NUMBER, so he worked out of the bullpen. The ORGANIZATION made him a starter this year, then sent him to the ORGANIZATION in July as part of a trade for PERSON Nunez.As a college reliever, PERSON worked from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with some sink and run on his fastball. He also missed bats with a slider/cutter that showed flashes of becoming a plus offering. It has slider depth when he throws it in the mid NUMBERs and cutter action when he pumps it in the upper NUMBERs.Though he made just one start in three seasons at GPE, PERSON has enough pitches to make it as a starter. He has some feel for a fading changeup and can mix in a decent curveball to give hitters a different look. He lives in the strike zone and is tough to hit when he uses his tall frame to create downhill plane.",0
"A native of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON made an impressive full-season debut in NUMBER at ORGANIZATION A Hagerstown. He continued that success the next season with PERSON and in the ORGANIZATION.

He blocks balls in the dirt well, already shows an aptitude for pitch framing and is improving as a game-caller.PERSON made progress offensively in NUMBER, but his bat remains well behind his glove. He has some pop and his easy swing gives him a chance to eventually hit for more average. As he moves up to the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION, his advanced defensive ability will allow the Nationals to be patient and allow his offense further develop.",1
"PERSON went back to the ORGANIZATION to start the NUMBER season to continue his development as an all-around catcher. He showed enough to get a bump up to the ORGANIZATION. He has some feel for hitting and some raw power to tap into. If he can become a Major League average hitter, he has the chance to have at least average power down the road.

He could soon be ready for a role in the D-backs' bullpen.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the first round of the NUMBER Draft -- a bit of a surprise to some -- they knew it might require some patience to watch this extremely projectable shortstop develop. Shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum during his first full season certainly slowed him, but did nothing to dampen the organization's enthusiasm about who PERSON can become.The further PERSON gets removed from the surgery, the better his arm is at shortstop. He's completely pain-free, though his throws don't quite have the carry yet that they did before the injury. His range and hands all still work extremely well at shortstop. His speed works on both sides of the ball, and he's starting to master the art of stealing a base. PERSON continues to make progress as a switch-hitter, getting more natural left-handed than right-handed because of all the reps he's taken. He's hit over power, but the strength in the bat is coming as he fills out. He's more upright in his stance and learning to leverage the ball more. Increased recognition of off-speed stuff and improved plate discipline will only enhance his offensive profile.Still a bit of a baby giraffe, PERSON has started to grow into his man strength and become a solid all-around shortstop. His makeup and personality are what they feel separate him and will allow him to reach his still enormous potential.",0

A fibula fracture kept him off the field in NUMBER, then a repeat of the flexor mass in his elbow set him back even further.When healthy, PERSON has a three-pitch mix to miss a lot of bats. His fastball sits in the low-NUMBERs and touches NUMBER-NUMBER mph consistently. He commands it well, moving it in and out as needed. He complements the heater with a tight curve ball that has a lot of depth to it and could give him a second plus pitch when all is said and done.

His slider should be at least average with some cut and deception to it. He's working on a changeup that he'll need in order to remain a starter at the upper levels.

A bidding war took place as he was playing for the GPE National Collegiate Team, and the ORGANIZATION were able to give him $NUMBER,NUMBER to sign as a free agent. He played his way up to Double-A in his second full season of pro ball in NUMBER.PERSON needs to figure out how to maximize his offensive value and do the little things -- such as bunting, slashing hits on the ground, the hit-and-run and moving runners -- enhancing his chances to reach his floor as a really good fourth outfielder. But with his speed, personality and ability to provide maximum effort, he could work himself into becoming an everyday center fielder. He doesn't strike out much and draws a decent amount of walks. While he's never going to be a huge home run guy, he does have a little sneaky pop and might run into a few homers.One issue for PERSON currently is personnel related: There are other center field prospects ahead of him, namely PERSON and PERSON. PERSON has seen time in all three outfield spots, so he will be ready to fill that backup role if needed.",0
"PERSON was part of the ORGANIZATION' July NUMBER international signing class in NUMBER, agreeing to a deal for $NUMBER,NUMBER. But he joined the ORGANIZATION two years later in the trade that sent PERSON to GPE, and he made an impact immediately. PERSON's NUMBER organizational debut was a strong one. Splitting time between Class A Fort Wayne and Class A Advanced Lake ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON led all ORGANIZATION farmhands with NUMBER strikeouts, and he needed just NUMBER innings to do so. He posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA as a NUMBER-year-old.PERSON racked up more gaudy strikeout totals in 'NUMBER at ORGANIZATION before making the jump to Double-A ORGANIZATION for the 'NUMBER season. He was even promoted to the ORGANIZATION for a spot start in GPE, where he pitched NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings of one-run ball in GPE. A couple weeks later, however, PERSON experienced a right-elbow sprain and was shut down at ORGANIZATION to rehab the injury.A slightly undersized right-hander, PERSON pitches with average fastball velocity, typically sitting at NUMBER-NUMBER mph. His plus curveball is a swing-and-miss offering, one thrown by design with varying velocities but consistent shape and action. His a changeup, which sits in the low NUMBERs with plenty of movement, gets whiffs and weak contact, too. He has a good feel for all three pitches, albeit with slightly below-average command. PERSON's ceiling is probably as a back-of-the-rotation starter, but his arsenal is already advanced enough to get big league hitters out.",1
"The ORGANIZATION accomplished three objectives in a November NUMBER trade with the Marlins: clearing spots on their NUMBER-man roster by dealing PERSON and PERSON, acquiring international bonus pool money and grabbing King. GPE had drafted him in the NUMBERth round in NUMBER, when he earned PERSON's lone victory in the only ORGANIZATION super-regional appearance in the program's history. He had a spectacular season after changing organizations, ranking second in the Minors in GPE (NUMBER.NUMBER) and third in GPE (NUMBER.NUMBER) while rising from PERSON to Triple-A, but has yet to pitch in NUMBER after getting diagnosed with a stress reaction in his elbow in GPE, but missed the first three months of the NUMBER season after getting diagnosed with a stress reaction in his elbow in GPE.King's success centers on precision command of a two-seam fastball that sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph. He can run or sink his heater to either corner of the plate, and he's an extreme ground-ball pitcher with a career groundout/airout ratio of NUMBER.NUMBER through his first three pro seasons. The ORGANIZATION also helped him improve his secondary pitches, leading to a jump in his strikeout rate from NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings in two years in GPE's system to NUMBER.NUMBER in his first in GPE York's.Both King's slider and changeup can be solid pitches when they're working, and evaluators generally prefer his slider by a slight margin. He has the best control and command among ORGANIZATION pitching prospects and one of the highest floors as well. Regarded as a finesse right-hander who might fit at the back of a rotation at the time of his trade, he now he appears to be more than that.",0
"PERSON was unhittable as a Cape Cod League reliever in NUMBER, then starred as a GPE starter the next spring and pitched his way into the third round, making him the second-highest-drafted hurler in GPE history behind only NUMBER first-rounder PERSON. In his first full pro season, he ranked third in the Minors in K/BB ratio (NUMBER.NUMBER) and walk rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings). He continued to throw four pitches for strikes in NUMBER, overcoming a lat strain to hold his own in GPE's lone plus pitch is a cutter/slider that he throws at NUMBER-NUMBER mph. His four-seam fastball has fringy low-NUMBERs velocity but is effective because it has a high spin rate and he commands it exceptionally well. While neither his curveball nor changeup stands out for its quality, he does a nice job of sequencing them with his cutter and fastball.Though he's following PERSON's path and has the best command in the system, it's uncertain whether PERSON can start in the Majors. His strikeout rate has declined as he has risen through the Minors, leading to questions as to whether he'll miss enough bats as a big league starter. He could find more success as a multi-inning reliever who focuses on cutters and well-placed fastballs.",1
"Back in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION aggressively pursued some high-end high school arms in the middle rounds of the GPE. That effort netted them PERSON, who is trying to establish himself as a big leaguer, in the fifth round, and PERSON, who signed for $NUMBER.NUMBER million, in the ninth. PERSON surgery forced PERSON to miss all of NUMBER and most of NUMBER, though he did finally join PERSON to make his big league debut in GPE in NUMBER.Throughout his career, PERSON has been an extreme groundball machine, with a NUMBER.NUMBER groundout-to-airout ratio that has gone up in his two full years since returning from elbow surgery. He gets all of that weak contact with his heavy power sinking fastball, thrown in the low NUMBERs. He throws a solid changeup and will flash an average curveball at times, though he still doesn't command consistently. PERSON added a NUMBER-NUMBER mph cutter with slider action that was very effective against left-handed hitters in NUMBER and allows his fastball to play up more, though he doesn't miss a ton of bats.There has been talk about moving PERSON to the bullpen, where that sinker-cutter combination could be extremely effective. For now, he'll likely keep starting as rotation depth so he can fill any kind of role once the need arises in GPE.",0
"PERSON spent three years in the UNC-Greensboro rotation, but they were uneven seasons, at best. The ORGANIZATION, though, liked his size and his potential enough to take him in the third round of the NUMBER Draft. He rewarded their faith with a strong full-season debut the following year and continued to climb the ladder in NUMBER, culminating with an impressive second-half showing in Double-A. But PERSON's time with the ORGANIZATION came to an end late in November, when PERSON dealt him and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON uses his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame well to throw downhill, and while his four-seam fastball doesn't feature a ton of sink or life, that plane can help him get ground-ball outs. It will sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range and can touch NUMBER-NUMBER on occasion. His changeup is his best secondary pitch and he also throws a true curveball, a breaking pitch that might improve if he can tighten it and add a little velocity to it.More athletic than you'd think given his gangly frame, PERSON fields his position well and repeats his delivery better than you might expect, translating in strong control and command and giving him the chance to be at least a back-end rotation guy in the future.",1
"A premium athlete coming out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON got an above-slot deal to sign in NUMBER. Initially a shortstop, he slid over to second base during his second summer of pro ball and has stuck there. The undersized middle infielder has some surprising strength and was showing more extra-base power during his full-season debut in NUMBER. He understands, though, that his job is to get on base and use his speed on the basepaths. He's settled in nicely at second and should be an effective defender there long-term. He profiles as a top-of-the-order type, especially if he can continue to show he can make consistent hard contact at the plate.",1
"PERSON was the best high school prospect in GPE in NUMBER -- and an all-state wide receiver as well -- but his commitment to PERSON dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBERth round. After performing well in college and leading the ORGANIZATION with in strikeouts (NUMBER in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings) last summer, he has a chance to become the first ORGANIZATION starter drafted in the first round since PERSON went third overall in NUMBER. The NUMBER ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year had a spectacular junior season, allowing just three earned runs in his final NUMBER starts and leading ORGANIZATION Division I with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA that's the lowest for a starter at that level since NUMBER.PERSON has four effective pitches and mixes them well. His best offerings are a low-NUMBERs fastball that reaches NUMBER mph and features some cutting action and nice downhill plane, and a solid NUMBER-NUMBER mph slider. PERSON also possesses a mid-NUMBERs curveball and a changeup with some sink and ORGANIZATION's athletic, effortless delivery allows him to repeat his mechanics and throw quality strikes. While he doesn't have a true out pitch or a lofty ceiling, he may have a higher floor than any left-hander in the NUMBER Draft. PERSON projects as a mid-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON' older brother, PERSON, was a NUMBER fourth-round pick of the ORGANIZATION out of high school. PERSON opted to head to PERSON rather than sign in NUMBER as a NUMBERnd-round pick of the ORGANIZATION. He's been a three-year member of the ORGANIZATION' rotation and stepped into the Friday night role when PERSON went down with an injury, though he missed some time with biceps tendinitis.Assuming health, and PERSON was back on the mound in May, the right-hander has a solid three-pitch mix coming from a high three-quarter delivery and easy arm action. He'll throw his fastball in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with good sink. His NUMBER-NUMBER mph slider is inconsistent, but it has sharp break and he can land it for strikes when it's on. His changeup should be a third average offering, a solid offspeed pitch with good sink to it as well.PERSON doesn't miss a ton of bats, but goes right after hitters. He did pitch well on the Cape in brief performances for two summers, which certainly won't hurt his chances of getting drafted in the top five rounds.",0
"PERSON was expected to serve as ORGANIZATION's Friday night starter until a preseason oblique suffered during a bullpen session prior to Opening Day wiped out his entire junior season. While the ORGANIZATION still took a flyer on him in the NUMBERth round in June, it appeared that the two sides were unable to strike a deal prior to the July NUMBER signing deadline. It later was revealed, however, that PERSON actually had submitted its $NUMBER,NUMBER deal with PERSON nearly five minutes after the deadline had passed, and a corresponding investigation by PERSON determined that the signing was valid because the parties agreed to a contract before the deadline. He spent most of his pro debut with PERSON, pitching to a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA with NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER innings, and continued to impress with PERSON in NUMBER. A NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER-pound left-hander, PERSON can run his fastball up to NUMBER mph, albeit with little feel for where it's going. He features a pair of breaking balls in a curveball and slider, both of which currently grade as fringe-average but stand to improve with experience. The same can be said for his changeup, too. PERSON's feel for pitching leaves quite a bit to be desired, though he did make gains with both his control and command in his first full season. He has the raw components needed to stick as a starter at the next level, as well as the pure arm strength to become a late-inning reliever should that not work out.",0
"First impressions aren't the be-all and end-all in the often long development path for prospects, but they certainly don't hurt. After signing for just $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER, PERSON had a fairly ordinary debut in the ORGANIZATION. But when he showed up to pitch in the GPE for the first time in NUMBER, he was lights out and led the ORGANIZATION in ERA.A very efficient strike-thrower, PERSON isn't the tallest right-hander in the world, but he has plenty of arm. He'll throw his fastball consistently in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range and was up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph at times last summer. He separates himself from others at his level because of his outstanding fastball command, throwing his heater with movement in the zone that gets ground-ball outs and swings and misses. His curve is developing and could be a plus pitch in the future, and he has a good feel for his changeup. He's strong and athletic, repeating his delivery well.Between extended spring training and the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON threw about NUMBER innings. That set him up well for his first full season in the ORGANIZATION, where he added to that first impression as a potential impact starter in the big leagues.",0
"Though PERSON was the hardest thrower in their system, he was so raw that the ORGANIZATION declined to protect him on their NUMBER-man roster after the NUMBER season. The ORGANIZATION picked him in the Rule NUMBER Draft and immediately sold him to the GPE, who couldn't keep him and lost him on waivers to the ORGANIZATION. Returned to GPE right before the start of last season, he skipped a level to Double-A and had his most consistent year as a pro to earn a spot on the NUMBER-man this time around.PERSON has a lightning-fast arm that has regularly produced upper-NUMBERs fastballs since he became a full-time reliever toward the end of NUMBER. He can reach NUMBER mph with his heater, though it gets straight toward the upper limits of its velocity. He pairs his fastball with a slider than can creep into the low NUMBERs and runs the gamut between a wipeout pitch and a below-average slurve.PERSON has the pure stuff to become a closer but still has a lot of work to do to reach his ceiling. He has spotty control and command, in part because he falls in love with radar-gun readings, overthrows and has trouble repeating his mechanics. He also allowed more hits than he had strikeouts in his first two years in full-season ball, which may be a sign that he lacks deception.",1
"The only player to appear on three world championship teams for ORGANIZATION, GPE, as a draft-eligible sophomore at FACILITY, was viewed as one of the more well-rounded college shortstops in the NUMBER Draft. The ORGANIZATION selected him with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick in the third round last June, signing him for $NUMBER,NUMBER.GPE does a lot of things fairly well, though no single tool is plus. He has a solid approach and makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate, albeit without power, and he can steal some bases now and again. He's a capable defender at shortstop, though most believe he'll need to move over to second base, where his below-average arm strength is a better fit, to have the chance to be an everyday player. He saw time at both middle-infield positions during his pro debut in the LOCATION, and that continued with the move up to full-season ball in NUMBER.The ORGANIZATION intend to give GPE the chance to stick at short, but his ability to play second should work in his favor and ultimately could help him carve out a role as a quality backup at both spots.",0
"The Draft-eligible sophomore out of ORGANIZATION had a solid, albeit brief pro debut in NUMBER. While many saw his future as a reliever -- most of his action in college came from the bullpen, though he did start some games -- the A's will let him develop as a starter for now. His stuff, to go along with how he pitched in short-season ball and instructs, give the A's some hope he can stay in that role. PERSON can crank it up into the upper-NUMBERs in shorter stints, sitting around NUMBER mph. He couples that with a hard, biting slurvy curve that can be nasty at times. While he's generally around the strike zone and goes right after hitters, his overall command needs to be refined. Even if the starting gig doesn't work out, PERSON has the right power arsenal and mentality to excel in the back end of a bullpen.",0
"Another fine high school catcher in this class, like many prep players on this list, PERSON had himself a busy summer. The Florida-area backstop played in the ORGANIZATION and then for the NUMBER and Under GPE National PERSON, sneaking in trips to the LOCATION Pro Showcase and PERSON All-American Classic.PERSON has a fast, handsy swing and has, at times, looked better at the plate in batting practice than in games. That being said, he did hit .NUMBER for PERSON this summer. If he can hit like that consistently, combined with his excellent catch-and-throw skills, PERSON has every chance to be an everyday catcher at the next level.While PERSON went NUMBER-for-NUMBER at the PERSON Classic, he also had a .NUMBER on-base percentage and .NUMBER slugging percentage for PERSONâs NUMBER and under squad, which won gold in the ORGANIZATION AAA/NUMBERU World Championships in GPE. He walked more than he struck out and drove in five runs.",0
"ORGANIZATION fans should get ready for another GPE to pitch in GPE very soon. PERSON is the nephew of former big leaguer PERSON, who spent several years pitching for the ORGANIZATION. He's knocking on the door, having reached Triple-A in NUMBER, though he missed considerable time with injuries. When he was on the mound, he continued to show tremendous stuff while developing a better feel for pitching. The arm strength has always been there and GPE shows a plus fastball, up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph. There's some sink to it as well and he gets a good amount of ground-ball outs as a result. He throws both a slider and a curve. The curve is better, especially when he stays on top it, throwing it with tight spin. The slider has a cutter action to it and both it and his changeup have the chance to be average pitches. If his command can continue to improve, he has the chance to contribute as a starter. If not, he'll definitely contribute out of the bullpen.",1
"PERSON flew under the radar at FACILITY, opting not to sign his junior year as a NUMBERth rounder, then going in the seventh round as a priority senior sign to GPE in NUMBER. He didn't have huge stuff then and still doesn't, with everything consistently grading a NUMBER and flashing NUMBERs at times. But the NUMBERs are showing up with a little more regularity, the command has gone from average to plus, and he knows exactly how to use the many pitches he has. Scouts think he's now a high probability back-end starter who outperforms his raw stuff in the minors and may continue to do so in the majors. 
He should start NUMBER in Triple-A and will likely have a few chances to fill in on the big league roster in NUMBER.",0
"PERSON' older brother PERSON signed as a non-drafted free agent with the ORGANIZATION last June after helping GPE win two College World Series championships in four years. Grant shares his brother's affinity for spinning a breaking ball but has more power to his stuff, making him a likely first-round pick in NUMBER. He has shown increased fastball velocity this spring, hitting NUMBER mph during a preseason scrimmage and often popping NUMBERs late in games, showing good life and command. PERSON also features a hard breaking ball that has become more of a true curveball. He'll need to use his changeup more at the next level, though it does show some promise. PERSON is shorter and heavier than his listed height and weight and may not have much projection left. That's less of an issue, though, because he already has the makings of two well above-average pitches and he has improved his conditioning.",0
"PERSON's PERSON career started out on the operating table as he needed PERSON surgery right after signing. He's since put that in his rearview mirror and while the results haven't been there just yet, he still has good stuff. PERSON will throw an average fastball that can touch NUMBER mph at times and he combines it with decent secondary stuff. His curve will flash plus, and he has a very good feel for his changeup. The key to the right-hander's future will be his command. If it can improve to PERSON average, he has the chance to start. If not, he could end up reaching GPE as a reliever.",0
"PERSON has grown nearly a foot during his four years at ORGANIZATION High -- the alma mater of PERSON -- and his fastball has taken off as well. He's now NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and throwing NUMBER-NUMBER mph with the promise of more velocity as he adds weight to his skinny NUMBER-pound frame.PERSON deals from a low-three-quarters arm slot, which costs him downhill plane but adds running action to his fastball. His delivery also makes it difficult to stay on top of his breaking ball, which lacks power and gets slurvy at times but can be an average low-NUMBERs slider at its best. His changeup is much better, a legitimate swing-and-miss pitch that can bottom out at the plate like a splitter.Though his arm angle can wander, PERSON is a good athlete and should have at least average control. He factors into the top three rounds of the draft based on talent, though he may be difficult to sign away from his commitment to PERSON.",0
"PERSON emerged as a viable first-round pick during the NUMBER Cal PERSON and then solidified his status the following spring at ORGANIZATION, leading to his selection as the NUMBERth overall pick by PERSON. In NUMBER, PERSON got off to a slow start at ORGANIZATION Antonio but made the necessary adjustments and found his power stroke in time to hit NUMBER home runs for the second straight season, finishing the year in Triple-A. PERSON picked up in NUMBER where he had left off, as he entered the All-Star ranked among the ORGANIZATION leaders in most offensive categories. PERSON has plus-plus raw power to his pull side, a product of his bat speed and physical strength and an upper-cut swing that's conducive to clearing fences. He strikes out quite a bit because the approach is aggressive and he has some length to his swing that makes him vulnerable to quality secondary pitches on the outer half as well as advanced sequencing. The contact that PERSON does make is consistently hard and loud, though, and he's shown the ability to make adjustments at the plate at each level.Defensively, PERSON's arm strength is nearly as impressive as his power and makes him a clean fit in right field, where he notched NUMBER assists between the NUMBER-NUMBER seasons. He's athletic and moves well for his size, with average speed on the bases and range in the outfield.",1
"The ORGANIZATION's biggest over-slot signing in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON spurned an ORGANIZATION commitment to sign for $NUMBER.NUMBER million in the fourth round. He struggled as a starter and when he recorded a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in Double-A, PERSON made him a full-time reliever in June NUMBER. He has had more success coming out of the bullpen and has adapted well to Triple-A after getting tagged for a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his first taste of that level last summer, increasing his value enough to be included in the trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION.PERSON worked with a low-NUMBERs fastball and peaked at NUMBER mph in high school, but his velocity dropped for much of his time as a pro starter. He began throwing harder again after making mechanical adjustments in NUMBER and harder still once he moved to the bullpen and worked shorter stints. He operated at NUMBER-NUMBER for much of last season before sitting in the upper NUMBERs and touching NUMBER mph in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON's fastball isn't as overpowering as it seems because it straightens out and he doesn't command it consistently. He can miss bats with a circle changeup that features splitter action but never has come up with a reliable breaking ball, scrapping a knuckle-curve and a conventional curve in favor of a low-NUMBERs slider with modest break. While he can light up a radar gun, he probably won't be more than a middle reliever unless he can harness his pitches.",0
"His bat could have made PERSON an early-round pick out of high school in NUMBER, but his unwavering commitment to PERSON dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBERth round. PERSON for a star turn at the NUMBER College World Series, his GPE career didn't go as hoped and he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as an NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER. After slumping throughout his junior year, he has hit much better at the outset of his pro career and reached Double-A midway through his first full season.PERSON's hitting ability remains the best part of his game. He has a quick right-handed swing and a mature approach, managing the strike zone well and using the entire field. He's more of an on-base guy than a power threat, though he can drive his share of doubles to the gaps.The question is whether PERSON can do enough else to profile as a big league regular. He's a well below-average runner, which almost certainly will force a move off shortstop. He has feel for the game and a good internal clock, though he'll have to watch his conditioning to have enough quickness for second base.",0
"A three-sport star in high school, PERSON climbed ORGANIZATION boards in the spring of NUMBER, thanks to his athleticism, arm strength and projectability. The ORGANIZATION grabbed him with their second pick of the ORGANIZATION and signed him away from his GPE commitment. PERSON typically throws his fastball in the low NUMBERs and is capable of touching higher velocities. Those readings may become more common as he fills out his large frame. His power curveball is his best secondary offering, while he's working to improve his changeup. He mostly pitches around the strike zone and worked to improve his overall command after signing. While he still needs some polish, PERSON has all the physical tools necessary to become a solid starting pitcher.",0
"The GPE made PERSON their sixth-round pick in NUMBER out of GPE Diego State based largely on his speed and defensive prowess in center field, but also because they believed he had untapped potential at the plate. He showed signs of breaking out the following year, when he paced all GPE Minor Leaguers with NUMBER stolen bases, and then performed even better in NUMBER as he led the Class A ORGANIZATION in runs (NUMBER) and on-base percentage (.NUMBER) even after advancing to Double-A Akron in July. Overall, he topped the Minors in runs scored (NUMBER) and tied for fifth in steals (NUMBER), with a .NUMBER on-base percentage that ranked first in the organization. After putting a bow on his big year as a standout in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON's progress has been limited in NUMBER after he suffered an early-season hamstring injury. PERSON is a disciplined switch-hitter who consistently puts the ball in play from both sides of the plate. His power is well below average, although he does show occasional pop from the left side. Those qualities, along with his plus speed and plate discipline -- which resulted in nearly as many walks (NUMBER) as strikeouts (NUMBER) last season -- make him an ideal candidate to hit at the top of an order. On the other side of the ball, there is no doubt among scouts that PERSON will stick in center field. He's a true plus defender there, one who gets excellent jumps and has range for days, and took home a Minor League Gold Glove Award in NUMBER. PERSON has everything teams covet as a top-of-the-order hitter who also offers value with his baserunning and center-field defense. But with PERSON ahead of him on the organization's depth chart, PERSON may have to serve as a fourth outfielder before he can carve out an everyday role.",1
"After being unprotected and unpicked in the NUMBER Rule NUMBER Draft, PERSON has produced everywhere he's gone. He set the Double-A Akron record with NUMBER RBIs in NUMBER, ranked second in the ORGANIZATION Winter ORGANIZATION with NUMBER home runs during the offseason and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in NUMBER. While PERSON's raw power is unquestioned, scouts are still divided about whether he'll hit enough in the ORGANIZATION to make use of it. His swing isn't rhythmic, and there will always be swing-and-miss in his game. PERSON is athletic for his size, but he's limited to first base, where he's an adequate defender. Right-handed-hitting first basemen can make for a tough profile, but his power gives him a chance to become an everyday player in the big leagues.",1
"At ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE) in NUMBER, scouts flocked to see two-way star PERSON and barely noticed PERSON, a short right-hander working in the upper NUMBERs during his first season as a full-time pitcher. They've teamed up in college at ORGANIZATION, where PERSON continues to draw plenty of interest as a slugger and PERSON has opened eyes as a power-armed closer. He set a school record and finished second in ORGANIZATION Division I with NUMBER saves as a sophomore last year, then opened NUMBER with NUMBER straight scoreless outings.PERSON's velocity jumped in the spring of his freshman year at ORGANIZATION and he now operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and peaks at NUMBER with some running life. His power slider gives him a second well above-average pitch at times, arriving in the mid-NUMBERs with some depth. He even can mix in a decent changeup on occasion.Because PERSON lacks size and features effort in his delivery, he's purely a reliever. PERSON strong and durable, he has taken a step forward with his control and command this year. Intelligent and competitive on the mound, he projects as a possible setup man or closer.",0
"The ORGANIZATION of GPE product went straight to Double-A for his first full season and more than held his own. Though he tired a bit by the end of the year, he learned a lot about what it takes to deal with the grind of the long season and rebounded with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON is an aggressive hitter who doesn't draw many walks, but he also doesn't strike out much. He makes consistent hard contact and has more extra-base power than most expect when they see his small and compact frame. PERSON will use the whole field and has good instincts on the basepaths. He's also a solid defender at second base, and those plus instincts help him in the field as well. He's just about ready to help out in GPE Louis.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",1
"The D-backs knew that PERSON, a second rounder in the NUMBER Draft from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, might be a bit of a project as he entered pro ball. He proved that by getting off to a good start in full season ball in NUMBER before struggling with a promotion to the GPE League before getting shut down with a dead arm in July. His ability to learn from that, reach the GPE League again in NUMBER, and have success, is a sign he's pointed in the right direction. PERSON offers decent stuff with a good feel of how to use it. His fastball backed up a little bit from his high school days, but it's still an average offering he can command well. His slider will show glimpses of being a sharp above-average breaking ball and he is capable of throwing his changeup with some fade. His command and control improved in NUMBER. Still very young, PERSON is still figuring things out. A few years down the road, he'd push through that dead arm period, but the organization felt there was no reason to at this juncture. Learning to prepare and stay strong through a full season has been a key in the NUMBER campaign.",0
"Reid-Foley carried a strong performance on the summer showcase circuit in NUMBER over into his senior season of high school and climbed draft boards all spring. The ORGANIZATION were happy to be able to select him in the second round. For a teenager, Reid-Foley has good polish to go with his impressive stuff. His fastball typically sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reaches as high as NUMBER mph. His slider is his best secondary offering and his changeup has the potential to become a third above-average offering, though it still needs some work. He also threw a curveball in high school, but hasn't used it much as a professional. Reid-Foley's athleticism should allow him to pound the strike zone, something he did as an amateur but has had difficulty doing in his first full pro season. His large, physical build, stuff and feel for pitching gives him the look of a future middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"A late bloomer in GPE, PERSON was nearly NUMBER when he signed in NUMBER and commanded just a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus. He led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his NUMBER pro debut yet didn't really break out until four years later, when he emerged as GPE's best prospect by the end of NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION expected him to contribute at the big league level last year but he made just eight starts before his season ended with a lat injury.PERSON improved once he added strength and started doing a better job of using his legs in his delivery. He now operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and can hit NUMBER with running action on his fastball. His curveball has gotten quicker as well and now sits in the low NUMBERs with good depth.In order to succeed as a starter in the Majors, PERSON will need to improve a changeup that stands out more for its life than its deception. He never has had any difficulty throwing strikes and has been able to avoid giving up home runs despite his extreme flyball tendencies. The ORGANIZATION praise his makeup and work ethic and believe he eventually can settle into the middle of their rotation.",1
"PERSON starred in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, with scouts voting him the summer circuit's top prospect and PERSON, his manager at GPE, saying he was more advanced than PERSON was with the ORGANIZATION. His hitting ability and athleticism had him poised to become the second first-rounder in GPE history (Bo McLaughlin, PERSON, NUMBER) until he slumped through most of the first half of his junior year. He rebounded at season's end and reached base safely in each of his final NUMBER games before signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a fourth-round selection.A left-handed hitter, PERSON sprays line drives all over the field and excels at bunting for hits. He was oddly passive for much of the spring, setting a career high in walks but also falling behind in counts too often and struggling once he did. He has ordinary bat speed and doesn't drive the ball much, so there are concerns about how much impact he'll have offensively.If he can recapture his Cape form, PERSON has the on-base ability and speed to be a dynamic tablesetter atop a lineup. He's a NUMBER-NUMBER runner on the NUMBER-NUMBER scouting scale and knows how to use quickness on the bases and in center field. He covers a lot of ground in center and his below-average arm is playable there.",0
"There are often expectations for a college lefty, especially from a program like ORGANIZATION, to move quickly through a Minor League system. In that regard, PERSON hasn't measured up. At the same time, though, the southpaw led the ORGANIZATION State League and came in second in the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts over his first two full seasons. He wasn't able to continue that trend in NUMBER as he missed nearly all of the season because of thoracic outlet syndrome that was addressed with shoulder surgery in June.Not completely a finesse pitcher, PERSON combines solid stuff with a good feel for pitching when healthy. He'll feature a fastball that's a touch above-average, commanding it well with sink to generate ground-ball outs and adding to and subtracting from it. He has the chance to throw a true curve in the future, but he'll get on the side of it and it takes on a different shape as a result. He throws a slider as well, especially against lefties, though the ORGANIZATION think the curve will be his better breaking ball eventually. His changeup gives him another offering that's slightly above-average. He throws all of his pitches for strikes and his command should only improve over time.While he doesn't have the highest ceiling in the world, PERSON wasn't too far from reaching it before he went down. The ORGANIZATION hope he can return to full health and be ready to contribute to the big league rotation.",0
"Big lefties with big stuff and a feel for pitching don't grow on trees, so it's not surprising the ORGANIZATION got creative and found a way to sign the ORGANIZATION high school product, despite the fact he missed his senior season with a stress fracture in his foot. More projection than anything at this point, GPE has the chance to have three at-least average pitches. He has an easy arm action and an above-average fastball that sits in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. He can reach back for a plus fastball at times and combines it with a solid changeup with good sink. He commands both of those pitches fairly well. GPE throws a slider, but it's behind the other two pitches. If he can sharpen that, he has the chance to be a solid starting pitcher at the highest level, though it might take a while for him to get there.",0
"Projectable left-handed pitchers aren't easy to find in the GPE. The ORGANIZATION feel they have one in PERSON, whom they signed away from an GPE commitment by giving him $NUMBER,NUMBER, more than $NUMBER,NUMBER over the value assigned for the pick in the third round of the NUMBER GPE.The North Carolina high school product has the chance to have a three-pitch mix, though there is work to be done. PERSON can run his fastball up to NUMBER mph at times, and there might be some more in the tank as he matures. His curve is fringy at present, but he knows how to spin it, and it could eventually develop into a solid breaking ball. He has a feel for a changeup, but he didn't thrown it much as an amateur. The biggest issue with PERSON is his delivery, which has some effort and some mechanical flaws that need to be cleaned up. PERSON is strong and fairly athletic, so the ORGANIZATION hope he can make the adjustments necessary to consistently tap into his raw ability on the mound.",0
"GPE (N.C.) HS had a nice GPE run in the mid-NUMBERs, with first-rounders and future big leaguers PERSON (NUMBER) and PERSON (NUMBER) plus third-rounder PERSON (NUMBER). The ORGANIZATION's best prospect since then, PERSON posted video-game numbers as a junior, going NUMBER-NUMBER with a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and NUMBER strikeouts in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings. He did the same thing as a senior, going NUMBER-NUMBER with a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and a NUMBER-to-NUMBER strikeout-to-walk ratio in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings en route to being named the NUMBER ORGANIZATION of the Year. Many scouts regarded PERSON as the top prospect in his class, and the ORGANIZATION were ecstatic to land the southpaw with a $NUMBER.NUMBER million signing bonus after selecting him with the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. After PERSON's fastball sat at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reached NUMBER last summer, it jumped about NUMBER mph this spring. He maintained his newfound velocity into the late innings and continues to show feel for spotting his heater on both sides of the plate. His curveball has emerged as a true plus pitch and the best of his secondary offerings, which also include a hard slider and a tumbling changeup that also grade as plus at their best.Scouts love PERSON's athleticism and competitiveness. He employs a big leg kick and gets good extension in his delivery, creating a deceptive look that can throw hitters off. All in all, the young lefty has a legitimate front-of-the-rotation ceiling, and he could make a quick rise from the high school ranks to the Majors compared to his GPE class peers.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of ORGANIZATION as a fourth-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON blossomed last year in his first full season, earning All-Star recognition in the Class A ORGANIZATION before moving up to Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore in July. He continued to climb the ladder in NUMBER, when received a mid-July promotion to Triple-A after earning Mid-Season All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION League.With good strength to his sturdy frame and a lofty swing, PERSON has intriguing power potential. It has yet to translate into much over-the-fence pop as a pro, though, with most of his well-struck balls instead going to the gaps. But some scouts still believe the power is still on the way, citing a lack of explosiveness with his lower half as a clear area for improvement. Regardless, PERSON has a chance to reach the big leagues based on his pure hitting ability and use of the entire field. PERSON has seen time at both corner outfield spots, but his below-average speed and average arm strength portend a career in left field. He currently profiles as more of a platoon or fourth outfielder than a regular, though that projection could very well change if he's able to unlock his power.",0
"The best college power hitter available in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON topped the ORGANIZATION with eight homers the previous summer and hit NUMBER in NUMBER games as a ORGANIZATION junior despite breaking the hamate bone in his right hand. He has produced as advertised since signing for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as the NUMBERst overall pick, leading the short-season LOCATION with NUMBER homers in his pro debut and slamming a total of NUMBER homers in his first two full seasons while advancing to Triple-A. His NUMBER blasts last year were six more than anyone else hit in the organization in the Majors or Minors.PERSON's massive NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame affords him plenty of strength and leverage, allowing him to hit the ball out of the park from foul pole to foul pole. Though he recognizes that his raw power means he doesn't have to swing for the fences, his left-handed swing can get long and he gets in trouble when he expands his strike zone. His whiff rate jumped to a career-worst NUMBER percent in Triple-A last year and he'll have to develop more patience to hit for average against advanced pitching.Primarily a right fielder in college, PERSON spent most of his first two pro seasons at first base and worked diligently to become an average defender there. He's blocked by PERSON in GPE, however, so he shifted to left field last May. His lack of speed limits his range, though he does have solid arm strength.",1
"It appears PERSON is all the way back after undergoing PERSON surgery in August NUMBER. He proved his health this spring as PERSON's Friday starter, pitching well enough to convince the ORGANIZATION to select him with the NUMBERst overall pick. PERSON has a lively fastball that he'll throw up to NUMBER mph and command well, working quickly and getting many ground-ball outs. His secondary stuff -- a slider and a changeup -- isn't quite as good as his fastball, though both have the chance to develop into consistently PERSON average offerings. The ORGANIZATION have moved top college starters (such as PERSON and PERSON) quickly in the past and with his three-pitch mix and some decent pitchabilitiy, PERSON could find himself on a similarly aggressive track toward the ORGANIZATION.",0
"There's a lot to like about PERSON, who joined the ORGANIZATION rather than attend PERSON. He's big, athletic and projectable and he's shown glimpses of having very good stuff. His above-average fastball has some sink and gets some groundballs while both his curve and sinking changeup could be average offerings. He also throws a slider, though it's slurvy and below average. PERSON's biggest issue has been his command and control, and in some ways he took a step backwards in NUMBER. His youth, raw stuff and size are too much to give up on, but this will be a big year for him to get back on the right path.",0
"Coming out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON's patient approach at the plate made him just the kind of advanced college hitter the A's have become known for drafting. He has excellent pitch recognition skills and remains adept at working walks. PERSON has taken a step forward this year thanks to a power surge. He hit NUMBER home runs in NUMBER games at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Stockton before earning a promotion to Double-A GPE. He will have to prove it wasn't just a ORGANIZATION mirage, but PERSON has always had big raw power waiting for him to unlock it. PERSON is more athletic than his frame indicates and is a solid defender at first base. He earns high marks for his makeup and understanding of the game.",0
"PERSON' fastball velocity has climbed each of the last three years and is now in the upper-NUMBERs. He struck out NUMBER hitters in NUMBER innings at ORGANIZATION in NUMBER before the ORGANIZATION brought him to the big leagues for six appearances (some out of the bullpen, some as a starter), and he struck out more than a batter per inning there, as well. He was slated to compete for a spot in GPE's rotation during the spring but was sidelined with a quad strain, and may begin the regular season rehabbing or in a lesser role due to the late start.
PERSON' secondaries can sometimes be easy to identify out of his hand, but purely based on movement, they're both plus. His command may limit him to a relief role, or at least a starting role that carries fewer innings than is typical, but he has high-leverage big league stuff, and was perhaps NUMBER's biggest prospect surprise.",0
"The way PERSON has pitched in NUMBER, it's somewhat curious why he wasn't the school's Friday starter from the start of the season. Regardless, he's pitched like one, showing a three-pitch mix and the ability to throw strikes with all three.PERSON's fastball will touch NUMBER-NUMBER mph and it has some late sink to it, giving him the ability to generate ground-ball outs. When he stays on top of his breaking ball, it's a solid curve with good tilt to it. He doesn't throw his changeup much, and it needs some work, but it has the chance to be a third average offering.Tall and strong, PERSON may not be among the elite-level college arms in this class, but he may not be too far behind.",0
"PERSON was noticed early in his career at ORGANIZATION for showing early round tools as a defender who can stay in the middle infield with above average raw power and some feel to hit. The feel to hit came into question in his draft year, as his swing got a little too pull/power oriented, helping him slip to the fourth round. The Jays rave about PERSON's makeup and preparation, and how he spearheaded the adjustments to his swing to have a shorter path to the ball and increase his contact ability. He now has a flatter-planed swing, and one scout compared his offense to PERSON, while another thinks PERSON is a NUMBER hitter with NUMBER game power. Most scouts think he's fringy at shortstop despite a plus arm, and would shift him to second base long-term for the best fit, where he's got a chance to be above average. An NUMBER to NUMBER wRC+ with solid average defense at second base is worth NUMBER-something WAR, so while it isn't sexy, there's some performance here, real changes to explain it, and a pretty good chance to be a NUMBER or NUMBER FV big leaguer.",0
"A two-sport speedster who has begun to grow into his body over the last several months, PERSON has moved toward the front of a crowded high school outfield class in the NUMBER-NUMBER overall range as he's a bit more game-ready than the other speedy, tooled-up outfielders in that range (PERSON, GPE, G. Mitchell) and more ilkely to stay in CF than the ones scouts think will hit (ORGANIZATION, GPE, GPE). He'll be NUMBER on draft day and is a bit raw for a prep bat of that age but the multi-sport pedigree explains some of that away.",0
"In NUMBER, PERSON took a college reliever from the LOCATION in GPE and came away with a steal. PERSON may have repeated itself nine years later, when it signed PERSON for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of PERSON. The most asked-about ORGANIZATION prospect at the NUMBER PERSON, he recorded a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in his first two pro seasons and made his way to Double-A a year after signing.PERSON's fastball velocity has risen from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with the ORGANIZATION to NUMBER-NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION. He throws from a low arm slot that adds life and angle to his pitches, generating lots of strikeouts and groundouts. PERSON encouraged him to use his secondary pitches more when he reached Double-A, where he learned that his improved mid-NUMBERs slider can be effective against both left-handers and right-handers.PERSON also has a changeup but primarily works with his main two pitches out of the bullpen. He's repeating his delivery more consistently as a professional, resulting in improved control and command. It's not out of the question that he could become the top southpaw in the ORGANIZATION' big league bullpen in just his second full year in pro ball.",0
"A NUMBERth-round pick of the ORGANIZATION out of the GPE high school ranks in NUMBER, PERSON was actually born in GPE but came to the GPE for high school. Given $NUMBER,NUMBER to sign, double the $NUMBER,NUMBER value for all picks made in the NUMBERth round and above, PERSON was taken and inked for his glove, but his bat is coming around, perhaps more than expected.There's no question PERSON can flat-out play shortstop. He has plenty of range, good hands, excellent footwork and more than enough arm to stick there long-term. He's made strides at the plate, showing the ability to make consistent contact, hit for average and get on base. An average runner, he can still steal a base here and there, but he has no power to speak of and it remains to be seen if his lack of strength will hurt him as he moves up the ladder.Still, PERSON performed very well during his first real taste of full-season ball in NUMBER at age NUMBER. His glove will continue to carry him, but an ability to swing the bat at all could turn him into a defensive-minded regular in the future.",0
"A NUMBER Freshman All-American as a third baseman at FACILITY, PERSON has spent the last two years behind the plate. His offense has suffered and his defense is inconsistent, yet he still flashes enough ability to project as a big league catcher if he can make some refinements. PERSON has good feel for hitting and makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate, though he walks infrequently. His strength stands out more than his bat speed and most of his current pop comes in the form of doubles, but some scouts think he could develop average power. Whichever team drafts him also could return him to the hot corner and hope his bat shows the promise it did two years ago.It's more likely that PERSON will enter pro ball as a catcher. He can demonstrate solid arm strength and reliable receiving skills, though at times his release gets too long and he'll clank balls off his mitt. He's a well below-average runner but has enough agility behind the plate.",0
"A closer in junior college and then again at ORGANIZATION, PERSON was another hard thrower drafted by the ORGANIZATION, taken in the NUMBERth round in NUMBER. He reached Double-A in his first full season, then was having an up-and-down return to the level in NUMBER.The undersized right-hander has shown an ability to miss bats consistently, even when he struggled in the LOCATION. He can touch the upper NUMBERs with his fastball and can sit comfortably in the mid-NUMBERs. He complements the heater with a solid hard slider that has good late movement to it when he's throwing it right. His quick arm tends to throw a lot of strikes, and he goes right after hitters.PERSON has closed games throughout his pro career, pitching across three levels during that first full season. His fastball might be a bit too straight at times for him to serve as a stopper at the highest level, but he's looking like another power arm in the ORGANIZATION system who can help out the bullpen in the future.",0
"PERSON was a classic ORGANIZATION recruit who wasn't touted much at a LOCATION high school, then stood out immediately on campus as an early-round pick. He didn't sign as a first rounder in NUMBER, then had a down season and signed as a fourth rounder in NUMBER. At his best, PERSON shows a NUMBER or NUMBER fastball and curveball along with an average changeup and command, for a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter type profile. He did that for most of NUMBER, which led to being a first round pick, then was less consistent from that point forward. We think he's about as good as PERSON, as a stuff-first righty who's close to the majors and either a depth starter, multi-inning reliever, or high leverage piece, but more a role player piece than a core starter type.",0
"PERSON had PERSON surgery as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, returning as a redshirt freshman in NUMBER and pitching out of the bullpen. He pitched largely in relief in NUMBER, mixing in a few starts, and was drafted in the NUMBERth round by the ORGANIZATION. But PERSON opted to return to PERSON to pitch in the rotation for his junior season. He threw well enough to land in the fifth round of the NUMBER Draft and while he didn't pitch much in his first summer, he did reach full-season ball, though he was too fatigued to throw at instructs.Big and strong, PERSON has an interesting three-pitch mix to work with, starting with a fastball that touched the mid-NUMBERs in his final college season, but sat more at NUMBER-NUMBER over the summer. It has a high spin rate and he can miss bats with it, though he also can keep it down in the zone with sink to elicit ground-ball outs. Both his slider and his changeup flash above-average at times, with his slider the more consistent of the two secondary offerings. PERSON has always been a strike-thrower, but didn't always command the ball well within the zone, leading to a higher hit rate in college than you'd expect given his stuff. That wasn't the case in his small sample size in pro ball, so the A's are intrigued to find out if he can continue that trend over NUMBER-NUMBER innings in a rotation.",0
"If everything clicks for this young GPE lefty, PERSON has the chance to be something special, even if PERSON seems a long way off.PERSON has everything you want from a southpaw. He has a fastball that reaches up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph, and he has a good curveball to go along with it. PERSON also throws a slider, which isn't as good as his other breaking ball, and he shows a really good feel for a changeup. The one thing of concern is that PERSON put on a lot of weight, and it is not the good kind. It's clear he's going to have to work hard on his conditioning to continue his progress.PERSON is only NUMBER years old. If he can get in shape, he has the stuff to be a top-flight left-handed pitching prospect.",1
"The scouting industry does a fantastic job of finding PERSON talent each year, but every so often, someone falls through the cracks. That's what happened with PERSON, who went undrafted after his junior season at ORGANIZATION in GSP in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION followed him in summer ball, signed him in GPE and sent him out as a reliever. He was a ORGANIZATION All-Star and had earned a promotion in NUMBER when his ORGANIZATION story hit a speed bump in the form of PERSON surgery in July.When healthy, PERSON has the kind of power stuff to profile well in a short relief role. The right-hander has touched triple digits during his first full season and sat in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. He throws a solid changeup as his best secondary pitch and also has a slider, which is a work in progress. A starter in college, PERSON does find the strike zone consistently, but his overall command, not to mention the injury, means a long-term future in the 'pen.The ORGANIZATION have had success finding bullpen help from the non-drafted free agent set, with PERSON making his big league debut in NUMBER. PERSON could follow suit once he returns. Still only NUMBER, he has plenty of time to get there.",0
"PERSON proved to be a versatile defender during his college career at ORGANIZATION, appearing at several positions. But it was his bat that scouts were most interested in, and his hitting ability got him drafted in the third round in NUMBER. PERSON hit NUMBER home runs and reached full-season ball in his pro debut, but he struggled offensively at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Jupiter in NUMBER. He got back on track in NUMBER during his second tour of the ORGANIZATION State League, prompting the PERSON to promote him to Double-A at the end of May. PERSON has a clean right-handed swing and a good feel for the barrel. He shows impressive raw power during batting practice, using his long arms to create leverage through the hitting zone, but he has trouble replicating the swing during games, especially against pitches at the bottom of the zone. That could change, however, as PERSON adds strength to his slender frame and gains experience.The PERSON used PERSON at both second and third base during his professional debut, but he's manned the hot corner exclusively since the start of NUMBER. His strong arm and soft hands are a clean fit there, though he could still end up back at second or even in the outfield. No matter where PERSON settles defensively, it'll be up to his bat to carry him through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON needed PERSON surgery at the outset of his professional career, and it took a while for the NUMBER draftee to get going in the ORGANIZATION system. He was impressive when he did start pitching again in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION traded him to the ORGANIZATION in January NUMBER as a part of a seven-player deal. PERSON has a plus fastball that sits in the mid-NUMBERs, and he can reach back for more than that at times. He'll complement the fastball with both a curve and slider and will even show a solid changeup, giving him the chance to have four pitches that are at least average. Despite the setbacks, PERSON will be NUMBER on Opening Day and should be ready to start progressing faster.",0
"/NUMBER: PERSON has PERSON surgerySigned by the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER.NUMBER million out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON ranked as the Class A ORGANIZATION's top prospect and helped Class A Advanced Myrtle Beach win the ORGANIZATION championship in his first full pro season in NUMBER. His stature continued to rise last year, when he impressed in high Class A at age NUMBER and went to the ORGANIZATION as their biggest prize in the ORGANIZATION Chapman deal in July. PERSON finished the year in the ORGANIZATION, where he became the youngest ORGANIZATION and batting champion (.NUMBER) in the circuit's NUMBER seasons. He progressed quickly to Triple-A in NUMBER before injuring his left elbow in a play at the plate and requiring PERSON surgery that ended his season in mid-June.PERSON has exceptionally quick hands that allow him to excel at the dish and in the field. He's very advanced at the plate, recognizing pitches well, displaying patience and using the entire field. His power projections seem to increase each year as he adds strength and experience, and he now looks like he'll deliver NUMBER-plus homers on an annual basis in his prime.Scouts also seem to gain a greater appreciation for PERSON' defense with each passing season. Though he's just an average runner, he definitely has the actions, hands and arm strength to play shortstop for a long time. GPE began playing him at third and second base in NUMBER, looking for a way to get his bat into its big league lineup.",1
"GPE is a big, athletic college lefty who, like many Cardinals draft picks, has been pushed very quickly through the minors. He has already reached Double-A and had success there in a six-start sample. He has four average pitches that play well up due to PERSON's ability to get way down the mound and release the ball right on top of hitters. His range of potential outcomes is quite narrow, going from backend starter to up-down spot starter or bullpen contributor.",0
"Thought to be the best high school player in the state of ORGANIZATION heading into the NUMBER season, the toolsy PERSON hasn't disappointed, with the outfielder having a solid senior campaign to put him in top five round consideration.A right-handed hitting center fielder, PERSON is a lean, wiry and athletic athlete with raw tools and room to add strength. He has some bat speed and strike zone knowledge, with that added strength, along with better positioning of his hands, allowing him to be a more dangerous hitter in the future. There could be some power there to come as well. PERSON is a plus runner who likes to runs the bases well and covers a lot of ground in the outfield, one who can stick in center field with an average arm.There is some upside with PERSON and the team that believes in that ceiling will take him and try to sign him away from his ORGANIZATION State commitment.",0
"PERSON noticed PERSON at ORGANIZATION Thomas More High (PERSON, GPE.) while scouting eventual Royals supplemental first-rounder Chase Vallot in NUMBER, and he developed into the state's best prep prospect for NUMBER. He went undrafted, however, because he wanted to attend his local college. Three years later, he should become the first Louisiana-PERSON pitcher selected in the first five rounds since the turn of the century.PERSON created a stir by hitting NUMBER mph in mid-March after missing a month with an oblique injury, though he usually pitches at NUMBER-NUMBER with some run and angle on his fastball. He has aptitude for spin, throwing a curveball with power and depth and morphing it into a slider at times. He also has an effective changeup to combat right-handers.While he possesses four pitches, PERSON also has a lot of work to do to remain a starter at the next level. He lacks reliable command, and he loses velocity and location on his fastball at times when he falls in love with his breaking pitches. He also has a history of nagging injuries, leading to questions about his durability.",0
"Though PERSON didn't begin pitching until he was a junior at ORGANIZATION (Ill.) High, his arm strength quickly became apparent as he reached NUMBER mph as a senior in NUMBER and NUMBER mph after transferring from GPE to GPE (GPE) JC in NUMBER. Ultimately signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-round pick out of GPE in NUMBER, he struggled to harness his live arm in this first three pro seasons before cleaning up his delivery last year. Following his breakout performance in high Class A, the ORGANIZATION protected him on their NUMBER-man roster, only to learn in March that he needed PERSON surgery that would cost him the entire NUMBER season.PERSON is a reliever who aggressively goes after hitters with two pitches. His fastball now sits in the mid-NUMBERs and can climb into triple digits, featuring riding life to go with its plus-plus velocity. His late-breaking slider resides in the mid-NUMBERs and can be a wipeout pitch, though it still can get slurvy at times.PERSON has started to realize that he doesn't have to try to blow out the radar gun on every pitch, a habit that causes him to overthrow, drop his arm slot and get under his pitches. His mechanics still aren't pretty but he's taking a more direct path to home plate and finding the strike zone. He issued just NUMBER.NUMBER walks per nine innings in NUMBER, down from an average of NUMBER.NUMBER in his first three years as a pro.",0
"The last GPE position player to play in the big leagues was PERSON, who saw time with the ORGANIZATION and A's in NUMBER. ORGANIZATION, a GPE native signed by the ORGANIZATION in July NUMBER, hopes to be the next in line.ORGANIZATION has the chance to develop into an all-around everyday big league third baseman. He should hit for some average, especially as he makes adjustments at the plate, which in turn will allow him to tap into his considerable raw power. While he did strike out a bit too much during his full-season debut in NUMBER, he also showed a willingness to see pitches and draw some walks. A shortstop as an amateur, ORGANIZATION has made a nice transition to third, with soft hands, a solid and accurate arm and enough agility to stay at the hot corner.ORGANIZATION tired in the second half of his first full season, not unusual for a young player. But he's worked hard on his strength and conditioning, with plenty of room to add to his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame.

"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE as part of an exciting international class for the Phillies that included PERSON, GPE put himself on the prospect map with a strong GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, showing off plus hitting skills. He lost himself a bit with the jump to full-season ball in NUMBER, but the Phillies are still bullish on his upside.GPE came out of the gate in his full-season debut doing what he had done so well previously, barreling up the baseball consistently and using the whole field to his advantage. Then he lost his approach and tried to do too much in a big ballpark, worrying too much about trying to drive the ball out. That led to a lot of NUMBER-foot outs instead of spraying line drives everywhere. GPE needs to add strength, something he did work on during the offseason, but really needs to focus on being a plus hitter, with whatever power comes as a result serving as a bonus.An average runner, GPE has the potential to be an outstanding defender at second base. As long as he can get back to the realistic gameplan that works for him , he can get back on the road to being a solid everyday middle infielder.",0
"PERSON was a two-way player as a high schooler in GPE, and he went to GPE as a shortstop. He was the ORGANIZATION's starting shortstop as a freshman, but his arm became too much to ignore. PERSON had largely abandoned hitting by his sophomore year.Though PERSON has only been a full-time pitcher for a few years, he earns praise for his understanding of his craft. He throws his fastball in the mid-NUMBERs, and it has touched NUMBER mph. PERSON's changeup is his best offspeed pitch, and his curveball gives him a third Major League-average offering.PERSON is an excellent athlete, and he repeats his loose and easy delivery well. He fields his position as well as would be expected from a former shortstop. PERSON earns high marks for his competitiveness and his aggressiveness on the mound.",0
"The Phillies have had some success in finding pitchers who came out of PERSON. PERSON, of course, was obtained via trade, but the organization did draft PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION two-year school. The hope is GPE, who helped ORGANIZATION win the ORGANIZATION World Series in NUMBER with a complete-game masterpiece in the championship, will be next.GPE has pitched well as a pro thus far, showing a good mix of pitches and a quick arm that earned him a promotion in NUMBER. He's an athletic lefty with an idea of how to attack hitters. He'll use a two- and four-seam fastball, getting ground-ball outs with the first at around NUMBER mph and ratcheting up the latter to NUMBER-NUMBER mph at times. His slider and changeup improved over the course of his season at ORGANIZATION and both are average offerings. He can also mix in a slider and throws all four of his pitches for strikes..While he's not the biggest guy in the world, with some thinking he ends up in the bullpen as a result, he is strong and athletic, which does help him repeat his delivery well.

He has a smooth left-handed swing with a ton of bat speed. Very strong, he barrels up a lot of balls, producing easy power. He has NUMBER-homer potential and could hit for a decent average. He still has work to do behind the plate, though most feel he has the tools to stick behind the plate. He has a solid and accurate arm and moves well behind the plate, though he'll have to improve his receiving and blocking skills.It can take high school catchers a while to put it all together considering the rigors of the position.

"A ninth-round Draft pick in NUMBER, GPE has long looked the part of a power pitcher with his size, arm strength and natural bat-missing ability. He had struggled to find the kind of consistency necessary to maximize his impressive physical tools and achieve sustained success as a starter. A permanent move to the bullpen in the second half of NUMBER sat well with the right-hander, as GPE pitched his way from Double-A up to the big leagues. He was included in the package of prospects sent to the Reds in return for PERSON in January.GPE throws a heavy fastball in the low to mid NUMBERs, occasionally reaching back for a few extra ticks. He added a slider to his arsenal in NUMBER, and it's quickly emerged as his best secondary weapon, thrown with power in the upper NUMBERs. GPE will flash an above-average curveball in the low NUMBERs, while his changeup continues to be a work in progress, though it's not as important in a relief role.GPE's inability to repeat his delivery was largely the source of his control problems and he struggled with consistent gains in that area as a starter. He showed great strides in NUMBER with his walk rate, and pinpoint command isn't a necessity should he stay in the bullpen. His fastball-breaking ball combination is ready to get big league hitters out in that kind of role right now.",1
"In his three years at FACILITY, PERSON went from a wild freshman to an all-conference closer as a sophomore to an important member of the rotation. That evolution helped him go from being a NUMBERth-round pick (signability played a role) as a GPE-eligible sophomore in NUMBER to the NUMBERrd overall pick in NUMBER, when the ORGANIZATION signed the right-hander for full pick value. PERSON was suspended NUMBER games in December after a second positive test for a drug of abuse.PERSON' calling card is his slider, considered to be the best college breaking ball in his GPE class. It's a mid-NUMBERs breaker with a high spin rate and so much break some saw it as a power curve, and it was a pitch he leaned heavily on in college. When PERSON is starting, he typically throws his fastball in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, but he sat in the mid-NUMBERs and touched NUMBER when he was relieving in NUMBER. He flashes an average changeup with some fade, a pitch he'll need more to succeed at the next level.Whether PERSON can remain a starter will depend largely on his command, which did improve in NUMBER, and whether his stuff will hold up over the course of a full season in a rotation. The Cards are committed to developing him in that role, with the knowledge his fastball-slider combination does look very good in shorter stints out of the bullpen.",0
"GPE and projectable when the ORGANIZATION picked him NUMBERnd overall in NUMBER, ORGANIZATION made steady progress through the ORGANIZATION while physically maturing and improving as a pitcher before making a huge leap forward in NUMBER by starting the year with NUMBER consecutive scoreless innings and pitching across three levels.ORGANIZATION gets good life on his low-to-mid NUMBERs fastball. He has developed a good feel for his offspeed stuff, and his slider and changeup both have the potential to become plus offerings. He has cut his walk rate the last two years, but his control remains below average. As dominant as ORGANIZATION has been, there's still room for improvement, both physically and on the mound. The ORGANIZATION patience for developing pitchers has reaped significant rewards in the past, and ORGANIZATION could eventually give them a similar payoff.",1
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON established himself as one of the ORGANIZATION' best prospects when he hit his way to low Class A at age NUMBER. His development slowed after that, but he still has some of the best all-around tools in the system, and he was having his best full season in NUMBER before he was suspended for NUMBER games in GPE for use of Stanozolol.PERSON's best attribute is his speed and he's also a switch-hitter with surprising pop for a little guy. He strikes out too much for a player with his profile, though he hits for a decent average and draws a fair amount of walks. If he reined in his overly aggressive swing and approach, he could become a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER-NUMBER homers per season.A second baseman when he turned pro, PERSON moved to the outfield during his debut. He's capable of playing all three outfield positions with his quickness and his average arm, though he doesn't always take precise routes on flyballs. Most of his action has come in right field the last two years.",0
"PERSON was outstanding as ORGANIZATION's ace and finished his college career with a NUMBER-NUMBER record and NUMBER.NUMBER ERA, racking up NUMBER strikeouts over three seasons. The A's selected the right-hander in the second round of the NUMBER Draft, and he offered a taste of his potential in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER. Although he struggled during his introduction to full-season ball in NUMBER, PERSON was able to make some adjustments over the course of the season and finished the year on a high note before truly breaking out in 'NUMBER.PERSON's fastball sits in the low NUMBERs, topping out at NUMBER-NUMBER mph, and has arm-side run and late sinking action. His curveball projects to be above average and is his best secondary offering at the moment, though he also has good feel for a changeup that could be at least PERSON average once developed. His slider was his go-to out pitch at ORGANIZATION, but it's been below average as a pro and requires further refinement.Though pounding the zone has never been an issue for PERSON, his first full season indicated that the quality of his strikes must improve. Some scouts wonder if he'll have the durability to remain in the rotation, although that hasn't been an issue so far. ORGANIZATION officials believe he has what it takes to be a big league starter, and the club's track record of developing undersized right-handers bodes well for his future in the role.",0
"PERSON switched his college commitment from PERSON to ORGANIZATION late when the PERSON head coach was fired after the season, freeing up signees to move. One other PERSON signee, current PERSON right-handed pitcher PERSON, switched to GPE and cost the ORGANIZATION two solid three-year contributors. PERSON had a big bonus number out of high school and was well-rounded, but had enough questions that clubs didn't feel comfortable going well past the $NUMBER million mark. 
At ORGANIZATION, he developed skills that work best in today's game: he's not seen as a lock to stick at a catcher but has above average arm strength to work with and is a plus framer according to some clubs' metrics. He's seen as a below average hit, above average power type at the plate and with the sorry state of big league catching, that adds up to a regular if things continue developing in this way. We've heard of at least two other clubs that attempted to get PERSON to their pick in the draft for an overslot bonus when PERSON stepped in and ruined those plans -- the best way to confirm that a player has industry trade value -- so we've moved him up just a bit since our draft day NUMBER FV grade.",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON's stuff and maturity enough to send him straight to the advanced short-season LOCATION for his debut at age NUMBER and he promptly finished among the league leaders in ORGANIZATION and batting average against. PERSON, strong and agile, he reminds some of a young PERSON, with the chance to have three at least above-average pitches. His fastball might be a plus, while both his curve and changeup show flashes of being above-average secondary offerings. He needs to improve his fastball command, but there's every confidence he'll be able to develop as a starting pitcher.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their second consecutive second round college reliever in NUMBER and after his velocity was way down just after his draft, he has since been as advertised. Mid-NUMBERs fastball, plus slider, a typical middle relief fit. He's on pace to help the ORGANIZATION bullpen next year.",0
"After going undrafted out of high school, PERSON spent the NUMBER season at ORGANIZATION (Fla.) JC, where he showed dynamic athleticism and tools but produced uneven results. The ORGANIZATION still made him their NUMBERth round pick that June, and he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER.Much like they did with NUMBER second-rounder PERSON, the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON with the intention of making him a switch-hitter. He's impressed the club with his aptitude in learning to hit from the left side, but, overall, he's a bit of a project at the plate. PERSON's elite speed is a weapon, both in center field and on the basepaths, but he needs to improve his basestealing technique. PERSON also has a well above-average arm, especially for center field. Team officials rave about PERSON's athleticism, speed and promising hitting ability, and the belief is that he'll eventually develop the necessary baseball skills.",0
"The trade that sent ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION has already paid the ORGANIZATION a huge dividend in the form of PERSON and, to a lesser extent, GPE d'Arnaud. If PERSON's transition to full-season ball in NUMBER is any indication, there could be more payment on the way.PERSON, who received a seven-figure bonus from the ORGANIZATION when he signed in NUMBER out of GPE, more than held his own at age NUMBER in the LOCATION. That he did so in GPE, one of the worst hitting environments in the ORGANIZATION, was even more impressive. PERSON showed some of his raw power in the first half, but he expanded his strike zone too much. To his credit, he adjusted, and his walk rate skyrocketed while his strikeout rate came down. PERSON has plus power potential, and his improved hittability could allow him to tap into it more consistently in the future. PERSON is an average runner with an arm a tick above average, with enough of each to play a capable right field. If the bat continues to click, he should have the kind of offensive profile teams want from the corner outfield position.",0
"PERSON won NUMBER games and struck out NUMBER batters as a sophomore in NUMBER, setting GPE school records and leading all ORGANIZATION Division I pitchers returning to college in NUMBER. He had first-round aspirations entering the year but had an up-and-down junior season before finishing with a NUMBER-strikeout complete game in the Big Ten Conference tournament. He fell to the ORGANIZATION in the fifth round but landed an above-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus.The PERSON' career leader in wins (NUMBER) and strikeouts (NUMBER), PERSON works from a low three-quarters slot that adds life to his pitches, all of which have the potential to be at least solid. His fastball usually runs from NUMBER-NUMBER mph with sink, though his velocity was down to NUMBER-NUMBER at times early in the college season. His sweeping slider can get swings and misses from both lefties and righties, and he shows some feel for a fading changeup.PERSON has a strong, durable build that lets him maintain his stuff over the course of a game and a season. He fills the strike zone, too, though some scouts wonder if he might be better suited as a reliever because of his arm angle. In shorter stints, he might have two plus offerings with his fastball and slider.",0
"PERSON is a switch-hitting PERSON. He just passes at shortstop and is a range-driven, above-average defender at second. He has more power when hitting right-handed but doesn't project to much damage in games. PERSON's flat-planed swing is most effective at catching pitches in the upper half of the zone, which makes him well-positioned to hit if the hitter vs pitcher metagame continues to trend toward letter-high fastballs. Bat-to-ball skills dictate powerless profiles like PERSON's. He either hits enough to be a NUMBER, or he doesn't and won't be rosterable unless he starts playing more defensive positions.",0
"It's taken a while for O'Conner to get going, but it looks like this former first-round pick is now headed in the right direction.O'Conner spent three summers in short-season ball before finally graduating to a full-season level in NUMBER. There, he started to show some of the extra-base ability the ORGANIZATION knew he'd always possessed. O'Conner needs to continue to refine his approach, but he's much improved at tapping into his considerable raw power. Behind the plate, O'Conner has one of the best arms in the Minors, one that allows him to control an opponent's running game. He's still learning the plate, but he has the chance to be an elite defender. It all comes down to O'Conner's bat. If it continues to develop, he has the chance to be an everyday backstop at the highest level.",0
"After PERSON's very strong showing in the ORGANIZATION last summer, scouts were very excited to see him in action as a junior at ORGANIZATION. A groin injury kept him out the first month of the season, but upon his return, PERSON became a popular destination for scouts. PERSON led the ORGANIZATION' starting rotation this spring with a NUMBER-NUMBER record and NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in NUMBER starts, during which he fanned NUMBER batters in NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings. The ORGANIZATION made him their first-round pick, taking him NUMBERst overall, and then signed him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million, slightly under slot value for the pick.PERSON has a four-pitch mix, and all of the pitches are thrown with steep angle from his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame that could add more strength. He uses a relatively easy delivery to fire fastballs that have touched NUMBER-NUMBER mph since his return. He'll sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, and his fastball has good run and sink to it. PERSON will use both a slider and a curve effectively, with his breaking stuff occasionally flashing plus, though it's been inconsistent. He tinkers with a changeup in the bullpen but doesn't have a ton of feel for it and doesn't use it much in games. He throws strikes with all of his offerings.Whether PERSON reaches his ceiling will come down to the development of his secondary pitches -- in particular his changeup, which will be crucial for him in terms of neutralizing left-handed hitters. He will also need to learn to differentiate between his slider and curveball, though that might happen organically as he faces more advanced hitters.",0
"Manning was a two-sport high schooler who could have gone to PERSON to play hoops. He was behind, developmentally, when he was drafted but is starting to take off now that his fastball and rainbow curveball have been tightened. He's a high risk arm due to his present command, but huge athletes like this take a little while to gain full control of their limbs so there's a good chance that's going to come, eventually.",0
"PERSON was one of the top two-way players available in the NUMBER Draft, with the majority of teams believing he had a higher upside on the mound. PERSON bucked that consensus, however, by taking him as an outfielder and paying him $NUMBER,NUMBER as a second-round pick.The ORGANIZATION winner at the Under PERSON All-America Game at FACILITY last August, PERSON combines bat speed, strength and feel for hitting, making it possible that he could develop into a .NUMBER hitter with NUMBER homers per season. He broke into pro ball as a center fielder, but he eventually should move to right, where his plus arm will fit well. PERSON is an average runner.On the mound, PERSON's three-quarters delivery gives him good angle and movement on his fastball, which averages NUMBER-NUMBER mph and peaks at NUMBER. He also features a promising curveball and a changeup with some life.",1
"The D-backs weren't able to land GSP out of high school in the NUMBER Draft after taking him in the NUMBERrd round, and the lefty went on to GPE PERSON and joined the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-rounder a year later. When the opportunity arose to bring GSP into the fold at the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, the D-backs didn't miss a second time, getting the southpaw as part of the ORGANIZATION deal with PERSON. GSP blossomed with the D-backs and earned his first taste of the Majors in NUMBER, only to be traded for the second time in his career during the offseason when he was shipped to the ORGANIZATION in a three-team trade with the ORGANIZATION. GSP pitched across two levels, reaching Triple-A in NUMBER while leading the organization in strikeouts and finishing second in ORGANIZATION, though he struggled to repeat those results in NUMBER, both in Triple-A and the ORGANIZATION. He has had success with a solid, if unspectacular, three-pitch mix, commanding all pitches fairly well. His fastball is above-average, thrown in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, and he's shown the ability to reach back for more when he needs it. His curveball has developed into a plus pitch and he has good feel for his changeup. When he's on his game, he executes his gameplan better than most.There could be more in the tank for GSP, an encouraging sign for a guy who already is on the cusp of a big league job. His NUMBER- and NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER-inning seasons in NUMBER-NUMBER are a pretty good predictor of what kind of workhorse starter he is going to be in the big leagues.",1
"An elite athlete, PERSON was a three-sport star in high school and was committed to GPE to play quarterback and pitch before the ORGANIZATION drafted him with the NUMBERth overall pick in NUMBER. PERSON has slowed his transition from athlete to pitcher and he underwent shoulder surgery in August NUMBER. After getting back on track in NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was a part of the trade that sent PERSON to GPE and PERSON to GPE during the offseason. PERSON has the stuff to be a frontline starting pitcher in the ORGANIZATION. He throws from a steep downhill plane and creates plenty of groundballs with his low- to mid-NUMBERs fastball. He mixes in his breaking ball and changeup effectively, with both pitches playing well off his fastball. More than anything, PERSON simply needs to prove his health problems are behind him. He hadn't thrown NUMBER innings in a year as a professional heading into NUMBER and could take off if he's able to stay healthy for a full season.",0
"PERSON was a pop-up PERSON prospect in NUMBER as a closer at ORGANIZATION who set the ORGANIZATION single-season saves record. The D-backs took him in the sixth round of that June's PERSON and decided to try to let him develop as a starter. He didn't take to it as much as hoped, so now he's back in the bullpen. While he is a bit of an undersized right-hander, his clean delivery and potential for a three-pitch mix made the organization think PERSON could work out of a rotation. His stuff backed up in the role, but the year spent trying it out will certainly make him a better pitcher. In shorter stints, his fastball touched NUMBER-NUMBER mph consistently, and he complemented it with a slider that flashed plus at times when he landed it for strikes. He incorporates a good splitter as well, and while he doesn't have pinpoint command, he throws more than enough strikes, especially coming out of the bullpen. After throwing over NUMBER innings in his year as a starter, PERSON has a better feel for his pitches and understanding of his delivery. His stuff isn't strong enough to close like he did in college, but he could have a future as a setup man.",0
"GPE hitters who perform always tend to move up on GPE day. PERSON was no different, hitting his way at ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick. His bat translated to the pro game, at least initially, as he helped LOCATION win a ORGANIZATION title and picked up NUMBER extra-base hits in NUMBER games.It will be PERSON's bat that carries him up the ORGANIZATION' ladder. The left-handed hitter has above-average power thanks to excellent bat speed. There has been some swing and miss to his game in the past, but he was more under control during his pro debut and while he did strike out some, he also drew some walks. As he refines his approach, he should be able to keep showing that his power will play in games. PERSON's defense is well behind his bat and while he'll never be confused for a ORGANIZATION Glove-caliber defender, he should be an adequate left fielder.That's all he'll need to be defensively if he continues to produce at the plate like he did in his first taste of pro ball. If that happens, PERSON could fit the outfield corner profile well enough to be a big league regular.",0
"Blessed with arm strength, but not always the ability to harness it, PERSON has moved slowly through the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION system since signing back in NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION left-hander spent two seasons in the ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. Another step forward to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn PERSON led to him making his full-season debut at age NUMBER in NUMBER.The ORGANIZATION have long liked PERSON's stuff. He'll sit comfortably in the low-NUMBERs and touch the mid-NUMBERs on occasion, thrown with good life. His secondary stuff still needs some work, but he has improved in that area as well. He does show a feel to spin a breaking ball and will flash an above-average one from time to time. It will vary from curveball to slider shape. He does have a changeup that has the chance to eventually become an average offering. PERSON's biggest issue has been with his command. He cut his walk rate considerably in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn PERSON in NUMBER, but he still carried a NUMBER.NUMBER BB/NUMBER ratio into the NUMBER season.The good news is that PERSON keeps improving his overall pitchability as he continues to move forward. Working out of a rotation will allow him to keep working on all of his stuff and his feel for pitching, with PERSON knowing his live arm could work well out of the bullpen if needed.",0
"PERSON tore his ACL a month before the NUMBER First-Year Player Draft but he still became the highest drafted position player from ORGANIZATION State in more than NUMBER years. His injury kept him out the rest of the year, delaying his professional debut until NUMBER.PERSON has a smooth left-handed swing and a good feel for the barrel. He has some pop, but his swing is more geared to hitting line drives than home runs.While PERSON is an average runner and has a solid arm, he doesn't have great range at third base. That leads some scouts to wonder if he'll need to eventually move to the outfield or first base. Regardless of his ultimate position, it will be incumbent that PERSON continues to produce at the plate.",0
"In many respects, PERSON is already a huge success story. He went undrafted and lightly recruited out of high school, making PERSON as a preferred walk-on. He was a three-year, and much honored, starter there and was the second-highest pick in the program's history when the A's took him in the third round of the NUMBER Draft, a spot he fell to because of a broken left hamate during his final collegiate season. He's turned into one of the better all-around catching prospects in the game, excelling in Double-A in NUMBER, though surgery on his other hamate in July shelved him for seven weeks. He was off to a strong start in Triple-A in NUMBER when he once again hit the injured list, this time with a torn left meniscus that required surgery in early May. PERSON has always stood out defensively. He's athletic and agile behind the plate, he blocks and receives well and gets high marks for his game-calling and ability to work with pitchers. He also has one of the strongest arms in the Minors, one that baserunners don't test too often and that has thrown out NUMBER.NUMBER percent of potential basestealers heading into NUMBER. He's a threat at the plate as well, with a short swing from the right side of the plate to go with a high contact rate. He's not afraid to draw walks and there could be NUMBER-homer potential in the future.PERSON will be a big leaguer based on his glovework alone, one who could be a defensive-minded starter. Add in his possible offensive production and he has the chance to be an elite-level, all-around receiver soon.",0
"PERSON was a reliever at ORGANIZATION (winces) who the ORGANIZATION wanted to develop a changeup and try to start, but he missed nearly the whole NUMBER season with a blood clot issues in his shoulder. Heâs up to NUMBER mph and flashes a NUMBER curveball in short stints, so relief wouldnât be such a bad thing, but it sounds like theyâll give starting one more try in NUMBER.",0
"A late addition to the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER-NUMBER international class, GPE signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE in April NUMBER and spent his first four pro seasons in GPE ball. He played primarily first base in his NUMBER full-season debut and was ticketed to repeat low Class A last year before high Class A Myrtle Beach manager PERSON wanted GPE as his starting catcher. He responded with career highs in most categories and earned recognition as a ORGANIZATION midseason all-star.GPE lacks showcase tools but possesses a high floor as a potential big league backup with a grinder mentality. His best attribute is his plus arm, which he used to erase NUMBER percent of basestealers in NUMBER. He has improved as a receiver and framer but still needs to get more consistent in both areas.Though GPE fits at the bottom of a batting order, he possesses some of the best plate discipline in GPE's system. He has a flat right-handed swing and uses the entire field, with almost all of his modest power coming to his pull side. He has below-average speed, though that makes him a faster runner than most catchers.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, just a few weeks before his NUMBERth birthday. He made his GPE debut the next year in the ORGANIZATION and statistically took a step forward while repeating the league in NUMBER. PERSON has some feel for pitching and uses his three-pitch mix effectively. His fastball sits around NUMBER mph, with some possibility for a bit more velocity as he physically matures. His changeup and curveball give him a pair of promising offspeed offerings, and he pounds the strike zone with his full arsenal.PERSON's stuff is comparable to that of PERSON. Like his teammate, PERSON needs to improve his consistency and get stronger so that he's able to shoulder a larger role as he advances in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON advanced to full-season ball in NUMBER and excited scouts with his powerful fastball. Though his progress was slowed in NUMBER by a forearm injury that sidelined him for two months, the ORGANIZATION still added him to their NUMBER-man roster in November. After beginning his career as a starter, PERSON pitched out of the bullpen when he returned from the disabled list. His fastball velocity ticked up after the move, and he was clocked up to NUMBER mph. His slider is his best secondary offering, and he also mixes in an occasional changeup. PERSON's older brother PERSON is a reliever in the ORGANIZATION system, and some scouts think that is also the best role for PERSON, one he stayed in during the NUMBER season. His power arsenal plays well and his below-average command isn't as much of an issue in shorter stints.",1
"PERSON led the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts in NUMBER. He also led that circuit in walks, a quick way to sum up what this young left-hander is about right now.PERSON has big-time stuff from the left side, with a fastball that will touch the mid-NUMBERs. He has a well-above-average changeup to go along with that heater. PERSON's curveball is behind the other two pitches, but it has the chance to be a usable weapon. He needs to learn to trust his considerable stuff in the strike zone more, and when he commands that breaking ball, he's awfully tough to hit.PERSON finished the NUMBER season with a very strong August, something the ORGANIZATION hope carries over as he continues to get work as a starter in 'NUMBER. If his command doesn't improve, a career as a lefty power reliever could be in his future.",0
"PERSON didn't generate any headlines when he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, but he has attracted plenty of attention since making his GPE debut two years later. He started drawing comparisons to Jose PERSON and teams almost immediately started asking for him in trade talks. After leading the Minors with NUMBER steals when he made the jump to full-season ball in NUMBER, he's putting together a nice encore in high Class A -- with the exception of a two-week suspension for insubordination in July that cost him a trip to the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON Game.A true top-of-the-scale runner, PERSON can get from the right side of the plate to first base in less than NUMBER.NUMBER seconds and has basestealing skills to boot, succeeding on NUMBER percent of his attempts in his first four pro seasons. More than just a slap-and-dash guy, he has wiry strength and displays solid raw power during batting practice that has yet to manifest itself during games. He could develop into a NUMBER-homer threat, though getting on base is a higher priority and he'll need to tighten up his strike zone to do that.Initial scouting reports on PERSON raised some concerns about his throwing arm, but it has gotten stronger and now grades as a plus tool. With his actions, range, hands and arm, he'll stay at shortstop for the long term. He needs to improve his defensive consistency after making NUMBER errors in NUMBER games last year.",0
"After PERSON went through the entire NUMBER season without an extra-base hit in NUMBER games, he exploded at the plate this summer and earned ORGANIZATION honors in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION. He led the circuit in hitting (.NUMBER), doubles (NUMBER) and ORGANIZATION (NUMBER) while also homering six times in NUMBER games.The PERSON liked PERSON's offensive potential when they signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE in NUMBER, and they may have gotten more than they bargained for. He has a patient approach and makes a lot of hard contact from the left side of the plate. While the ORGANIZATION is a hitter's league, he does have emerging power that should result in plenty of doubles and double-digit home run totals.PERSON was a shortstop when PERSON first worked him out, so he's still learning behind the plate. That said, he has solid arm strength as well as the hands to become an average receiver. He's a below-average runner, like most catchers, but shows some instincts on the bases.",1
"A year after reaching Double-A for the first time, PERSON showed his NUMBER production wasn't a fluke. In NUMBER, he finished third in the organization in homers and slugging percentage. He's a very aggressive hitter with a bit of an all-or-nothing approach at the plate. PERSON and bit stocky, there's definite strength there and some refinement at the plate might allow him to tap into more power. While he has fringy speed, he's shown some baserunning acumen and could continue to put up double-digit stolen-base totals. He's played all three outfield spots in the past, but settled into right field in NUMBER, where he should be an average defender. Some see him as more of a fourth outfielder when all is said and done, but if the overall hitting abilty can come, he still has the chance to be an everyday corner outfielder.",1
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON out of the GPE high school ranks in NUMBER, but never made a serious run at signing him away from his PERSON commitment. He was available again two years later as a Draft-eligible sophomore and PERSON didn't pass up on his polish and feel for pitching in the second round.PERSON uses average stuff across the board with excellent command to get hitters out. His fastball might be a tick below-average velocity-wise, sitting in the upper-NUMBERs and touching NUMBER-NUMBER mph at times, but the sink and the command allow it to play up. He used it to generate a ton of ground-ball outs during his pro debut and keeping it down in the zone will be key for him as he advances. So will his ability to mix in his average secondary stuff. His slow curve and sweeping slider can sometimes run into each other as a slurvy breaking ball, while his average changeup features some sink.PERSON has a very limited ceiling, that as a back-end starter in the big leagues. But he's not that far off from reaching it, with his pitchability likely to allow him to move quickly.",0
"The ORGANIZATION didn't place PERSON on the NUMBER-man roster this offseason, leaving him exposed for the Rule NUMBER Draft, thinking most organizations wouldn't take a flier on a power hitter who only had NUMBER games above the A ball level. They were right, and the big, physical first baseman remained in the fold for the NUMBER season. The raw power is legitimate, at least above-average. It hasn't shown up in games quite as regularly as it did during his breakout NUMBER season, though he did finish with NUMBER extra-base hits in NUMBER and NUMBER in 'NUMBER. The strikeouts will continue to come, but so will the walks. He's an average defender, at best, though he'll be fine at first. It will be his bat that gets him to the big leagues.",0
"PERSON starred for ORGANIZATION's high school squad as a senior, but signability concerns caused him to fall to the eighth round of the NUMBER Draft, where the ORGANIZATION were able to lure him away from a GPE commitment with a $NUMBER,NUMBER bonus. He was sharp in his abbreviated pro debut, and then was shipped off to the ORGANIZATION as part of the ORGANIZATION trade in November NUMBER. PERSON had continued to make strides during full-season debut with PERSON before landing on the disabled list in early June with left elbow soreness, though he had recovered from the injury by late in the season and it hasn't affected his progress in NUMBER.PERSON's prospect stock took off last spring behind an uptick in velocity that pushed his formerly below-average fastball into the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. His heater has good life, too, which makes it difficult for opponents to barrel. PERSON's arsenal of secondary pitches is equally impressive, as his slider, curveball and changeup all have the potential to be average or better once fully developed.PERSON's advanced feel for pitching made for an easy transition to the professional ranks, and he's shown the ability to throw each of his four pitches for strikes early in his career. PERSON has been a non-issue for PERSON in NUMBER, and he had already established a new career-high workload by midseason.",1
"In a system filled with raw, toolsy position players, PERSON stands out for his polish at the plate. After signing for a well-over-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER as a third-rounder in NUMBER, he batted .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with nearly as many walks (NUMBER) as strikeouts (NUMBER) in his first two pro seasons.PERSON is an advanced hitter for his age, recognizing pitches and controlling the strike zone better than most and producing line drives to all fields. He barrels balls easily and has a quick right-handed bat, so he might reach double digits in home runs once he gets stronger. He has average speed that plays well on the bases but won't result in many steals.Though PERSON saw more action at second base in his pro debut and third base the last two years because PERSON has so much shortstop depth, the ORGANIZATION believe he can play short. While his range is average, he has good instincts, reliable hands and a solid, accurate arm. PERSON tried him as a catcher during instructional league and may give him more exposure behind the plate.",0
"After watching PERSON pop up on GPE radars in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION took the hard-throwing GPE high school product in the second round of that June's GPE. His first taste of full-season ball, in NUMBER, didn't go so well, but he started figuring things out in NUMBER, taking the biggest step forward among the top arms at the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION' system.PERSON looked more like the future big league starter the ORGANIZATION envisioned in NUMBER, finishing fifth in the organization in both ORGANIZATION and strikeouts and among the ORGANIZATION leaders in several pitching categories. PERSON's plus plus fastball will touch the upper-NUMBERs consistently with good movement and will always be his best pitch. The right-hander made huge strides with his changeup in NUMBER to the point where it now looks like it will be an above-average pitch. His focus on his changeup did lead to him losing some usage of his slider, though the hard breaking ball still flashes plus.Command and control will be the next things PERSON will have to improve on in order to make the next step. The big-bodied flame-thrower showed more stamina and durability in NUMBER. Now it's time for him to put it all together in order to reach his ceiling as a frontline starter.",0
"Back in NUMBER, this ORGANIZATION of GPE product stepped up with a big first full year, swiping NUMBER bases and showing an ability to make contact, get on base and play excellent outfield defense. He was pushed up to Double-A in NUMBER and held his own, though he wasn't as effective on the basepaths. It turned out he was playing hurt for much of the year, with plantar fasciitis. He repeated the level in NUMBER and was back to his old self on the bases. He puts the ball in play with a line drive swing, albeit without much power. He plays a strong center field to boot, where some think he's as good as PERSON defensively, and even a better hitter than the former ORGANIZATION center fielder, just not with the pop PERSON has.",0
"After his strong sophomore season at ORGANIZATION, scouts were excited to see what PERSON could do to raise his profile as a power-hitting third basemen. He transferred to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION, making it tougher for scouts to evaluate his performance, though PERSON certainly did his part by hitting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with NUMBER home runs and NUMBER doubles. It's that offensive upside that led the ORGANIZATION to take him in the second round of the NUMBER Draft and then sign him for $NUMBER.NUMBER million.The left-handed hitter reminds some of a young Chase Utley in terms of body type. There is some pop in his bat as he reached double digits in home runs as a sophomore and had easily surpassed that with PERSON in NUMBER. At times, he's looked like a middle-of-the-order corner bat, while there are other instances where he hasn't been as consistent, and figuring out how his bat will play was more difficult while watching him against ORGANIZATION competition. PERSON is athletic and should be able to stay at third, with a strong arm that fired NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastballs as PERSON's closer. Though a lack of impact bats at the college level this year undoubtedly helped his stock, club officials are confident that PERSON's bat is for real and will translate in the professional ranks.",0
"PERSON impressed scouts before the NUMBER GPE, consistently throwing his fastball NUMBER mph or more. The velocity made him one of the hardest throwers in GPE history as well as a candidate to become the first high school right-hander to go No. NUMBER overall. The ORGANIZATION ended up taking the NUMBER-foot-NUMBER Texan with the second pick of the GPE and signed him for $NUMBER million, the largest bonus in franchise history. After an up-and-down first full season, PERSON was having a strong Spring Training in NUMBER when an elbow injury resulted in PERSON surgery in early April.After showing elite velocity as an amateur, PERSON worked more in the low- to mid-NUMBERs during his full-season debut at ORGANIZATION A Greensboro in NUMBER. He is capable of getting heavy sinking life on his fastball, resulting in lots of ground-ball outs. Both PERSON's slider and changeup are below average and limit his bat-missing ability, although he did make strides with the former during instructional league, throwing it with improved depth and power. Once he returns from surgery, PERSON will have a ways to go with his control and command, but the ORGANIZATION believe both should improve as he becomes more comfortable repeating his delivery. He might not be as advanced as initially thought at the time of the GPE, but the size, stuff and arm strength still gives him top-of-the-rotation potential.",0
"After winning multiple gold medals with GPE national teams as a high schooler, PERSON made an immediate impact as a two-way player as an GPE freshman in NUMBER before blowing out his elbow the following spring. He missed all of NUMBER before returning this year and opening his redshirt junior season with a school-record NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER scoreless innings. Outside of missing one start with shoulder tendinitis, he looked as good as ever before signing with GPE for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a third-round choice.As with NUMBER Cubs first-rounders PERSON and PERSON, PERSON's best pitch is his curveball. It's a true downer that he sets up with two- and four-seam fastballs. He operates in the upper NUMBERs with his sinker and tops out at NUMBER mph with his four-seamer, which lacks life at higher velocities.PERSON demonstrates solid feel for his changeup as well and always has filled the strike zone. He has become a better pitcher since having his elbow reconstructed, concerning himself with getting outs rather than velocity. He has a relatively high floor as a No. NUMBER starter, and his curve also could help make him an effective reliever.",0
"A big part of why PERSON's college performance never quite matched the power/speed hype of his high school tools was that his swing was not geared for any sort of lift. He clearly had substantial raw power, but never slugged more than his freshman year mark of .NUMBER at ORGANIZATION. Since college, PERSON's swing has evolved in a way that better incorporates his lower half. It has more scoop, more ability to catch pitches in, and he's better able to lift balls that are down. Supporting evidence can be found by observing PERSON's batted ball profile, as his groundball rate is now close to league average instead of well above it. Though he thickened quickly in college, PERSON is still an above-average runner once he gets underway. His slow first few steps prevent him from everyday viability in center field, and PERSON saw more time in the outfield corners last year than at any other time during his career. He projects as a platoon corner outfielder, especially if last year's swing changes were just the start of a continuous, upward trend in power output.",0
"GPE is one of the youngest players in this year's class and won't be able to sign until he turns NUMBER in GPE, but that has not stopped scouts from raving about his potential.A physically mature third baseman with soft hands and an accurate plus-arm, GPE is a solid defender with good footwork around the bag. Offensively, GPE shows good bat speed and the ability to hit to all fields. He has displayed large power during batting practice, and it sometimes shows up in games.There is some concern about his ability to recognize pitches and that has swing can get long at times, but some scouts believe GPE is a sleeper and has the potential to be the top player out of this year's crop of prospects. PERSON also like his baseball IQ, his makeup and the notion that he's only going to get better as he grows older.",0
"The younger brother of ORGANIZATION catching prospect Jin-De PERSON, PERSON starred in international tournaments for GPE before signing with the GPE for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER. He earned league all-star honors four times in his first five pro seasons despite perennially being young for his circuit, including being the youngest batting qualifier (age NUMBER) in the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. Blocked at shortstop by PERSON in GPE, he boosted his stock by starring in the ORGANIZATION while playing third base.PERSON is atypical for a middle fielder in that his raw power might be his most impressive tool. He has a quick right-handed swing with good leverage and strength, and he has feel for backspinning the ball to all fields. His aggressive approach leads to doubles and home runs but also strikeouts, so he probably won't hit for a high average.An average runner, PERSON isn't a threat on the bases but gets the job done at shortstop. He has reliable hands, solid arm strength and a good internal clock. An average defender at short, he could be a solid third baseman with more experience and will see more time at second base as the GPE try to increase his versatility.",1
"PERSON's bat and speed made him a second-round pick in the NUMBER Draft out of GPE and enabled him to have immediate success as a pro. He ranked third in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in hitting (.NUMBER) and on-base percentage (.NUMBER) in his debut, then finished second (.NUMBER) and first (.NUMBER) in those categories the Class A Advanced PERSON despite skipping the Class A level entirely. After finishing NUMBER with a strong month in Double-A, PERSON was acquired by PERSON in February as part of a three-team trade involving the D-backs. PERSON has excelled at hitting for average and has gotten on base at every level at which he has played. He makes repeated line-drive contact with a quick right-handed swing and a gap-to-gap approach. While he's not a huge home run threat, he can drive the ball to the gaps, and his NUMBER homers in NUMBER were two more than he totaled in three years of college.Though he drew comparisons to former ORGANIZATION PERSON during his time in their system, PERSON has a better chance to make it as an everyday second baseman because of his superior speed and defense. His solid speed enhances his on-base ability and he has the instincts to provide double-digit steals on an annual basis. He has a below-average arm and isn't the most fluid second baseman, but he has worked hard to improve his defensive footwork at the keystone, and the ORGANIZATION have already begun moving around the outfield so as to increase his versatility.",1
"The ORGANIZATION rolled the dice in the eighth round of the NUMBER Draft by taking ORGANIZATION from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks. After a rough summer debut, he made progress in a return to the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, then was dealt to the D-backs in the offseason for PERSON Hellickson.He's continued to improve under PERSON's watch, earning an assignment out of extended spring camp to the full-season ORGANIZATION in June. PERSON and physical, ORGANIZATION has reminded some of PERSON at a similar age. At NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, he uses his frame well to pitch downhill. His fastball will be up to NUMBER-NUMBER mph fairly consistently, and he throws it with good sink to generate a ton of ground-ball outs. His curveball has improved and should be PERSON average in the future and will even flash plus on occasion. He mixes in a good sinking changeup as well. While his overall command still needs improvement, his ability to pitch off his fastball and keep it around the strike zone is impressive given his age.Still learning how to pitch and physically maturing, ORGANIZATION may have more in the tank. By the time he reaches the top of the system, he might be a much better pitching prospect.",0
"PERSON (pronounced with a vowel sound like 'plow' or 'allow') was an under-the-radar, bat-first prospect at ORGANIZATION who the ORGANIZATION picked in the third round. He has always been a second baseman but was never the pedigree type given his position and average at best speed, defense, and arm. He also tore his ORGANIZATION as a freshman. His indicators were positive--plate discipline, contact skills, bat speed, enough power to profile--and we were high on PERSON entering the year, pegging him as a NUMBER FV. He went off in NUMBER, following a fine Double-A look in NUMBER by demolishing the level in NUMBER, then performing even better at Triple-A, earning a big league look, where he put up almost NUMBER.NUMBER WAR in just NUMBER games. The offense has taken off even more than those highest on him internally had expected, with some chance for NUMBER hit and NUMBER game power with passable defense at second, along with versatility to play left field and possibly first base if needed. PERSON is now in the weird prospect spot where he isn't the highly-drafted, tooled-up brand name type you typically find in the middle of a top NUMBER, but he's about as low risk of a bat as there is with prospect eligibility, and he can also play up the middle, so his six years of control have tons of value to a small market team like the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The son of former ORGANIZATION infielder PERSON Sr., the teenage infielder grew up around the game, and it shows.PERSON like PERSON's swing, his strong arm and his fluid actions on defense. He's shown decent arm strength and raw power to his pull side. PERSON's knack for barreling up balls and his repeatable swing have also impressed evaluators.Some believe PERSON can play multiple positions and could end up at second or third base or even in the outfield. His big frame will allow him to build strength. PERSON also like his makeup and how he handles himself on and off the field. He has a game-oriented mindset, and his makeup is off the charts.PERSON signed a $NUMBER,NUMBER deal with the FACILITY.",0
"GPE and PERSON bloodlines are a big reason why PERSON was taken in the third round of the NUMBER Draft. The son of former big leaguer PERSON, he has the wheels to steal bases and run down balls in center field. A switch-hitter, he profiles as a catalyst at the top of a lineup. He has some bat speed, but didn't always make consistent hard contact at ORGANIZATION. PERSON jumps and routes should help him be an above-average defender and he can outrun his mistakes as he's learning now. If his bat can develop, he has the chance to become a leadoff hitter of the future for the FACILITY.",0
"He doesn't throw all that hard, but PERSON has an impact breaking ball and, other than in NUMBER, a history of throwing lots of strikes. Other than his plunging NUMBER-NUMBER curveball, PERSON's stuff is very average and his fastball may be vulnerable once hitters have seen it a few times. It might make him more viable in a multi-inning relief role where he can throw the curveball a ton and use the fastball as a change of pace pitch.",0
"Sometimes, young prospects struggle when they make their GPE debut. PERSON, on the other hand, stood out immediately as a NUMBER-year-old in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in NUMBER, then really took off in NUMBER pitching across two levels of Class A ball and earning the organization's ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year honors. The jump to Double-A in NUMBER proved to be a little more challenging.What makes PERSON's year stand out even more is the fact he did it while largely putting his best pitch in his back pocket. The right-hander has always been a strike-thrower with an outstanding changeup, but he bought into the ORGANIZATION' plan for him and focused on his slider all year, which undoubtedly hurt his strikeout rate. He'll show an average slider at times and the work he put into the pitch in NUMBER should pay off in the future, moving it closer to his plus fastball and offspeed pitch. Clearly willing to do whatever it takes to make him a more complete pitcher, PERSON is learning what he needs to work on to succeed at the upper levels. The ORGANIZATION are excited to see what he can do there, with the hope they have a mid-rotation starter on their hands.",1
"GPE's developmental path had him poised to make his big league debut in NUMBER after a NUMBER season that saw him reach Triple-A. Instead, GPE had PERSON surgery in early April and missed the entire season. Surgery and rehab went well, and he was working his way back to pitching competitively NUMBER when an inguinal hernia required surgery in July. When healthy, GPE has three above-average to plus pitches at his disposal, all coming from a big NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. His fastball sits in the mid NUMBERs, and he maintains his velocity deep into starts. He has an outstanding curve, a big overhand breaking ball that can miss bats as well. His changeup hasn't been as consistent, but it has shown flashes of being at least a Major League average pitch. While wildness hasn't been a real issue, GPE's overall command hadn't been as sharp. ORGANIZATION and feel for pitching often is what takes the longest to come back post-surgery. The good news is that, at age NUMBER for all of the NUMBER season, GPE is still ahead of the curve.",0
"GPE does not miss many bats because he has limited fastball velocity, but he's a high-volume strike thrower with excellent secondary stuff, including one of the best curveball spin rates in the minors. He draws from a spacious bag of tricks to get hitters out, and has now had success at the upper levels of the minors with limited velo, so we're buying that he can make things work as a fifth starter.",0
"PERSON felt forearm tightness while throwing live batting practice to PERSON in late February, and five days later Dr. PERSON was reconstructing his ORGANIZATION. It was the first of several season-ending injuries Rays prospects would sustain early in the year, and it delayed PERSON's run at a potential Rookie of the Year award. A creative sequencer, PERSON's deep, unique repertoire is unlike any other pitcher in the minors. Though his fastball touches NUMBER, his stuff is so diverse that he never has to pitch off of it. He can lob his curveball in for strikes, induce weak contact early in counts by throwing a cutter when hitters are sitting fastball, and he'll double and triple up on the changeup. What you see listed in PERSON's tool grades as a splitter is actually a screwball. It wobbles home in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, while his true changeup is usually a little harder than that. The screwgie is more than a gimmick and can miss bats, though itâs best in moderation because it's a little easier to identify out of his hand, and hitters are able to recognize it after seeing it multiple times in the same at-bat. PERSON's delivery is pretty violent and his TJ was not his first injury, but he's ready and has No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter stuff if it comes back after the surgery. He has been throwing off a mound since early December and should be pitching in games before April is through.",0
"There has never been any question about Familiaâs arm strength and his ability to generate swings and misses, with his strikeout rate of nearly a batter per inning throughout his ORGANIZATION career. He can maintain his mid-NUMBERs velocity throughout his starts with good sink. His slider with short bite gives him a very good breaking ball to complement his fastball, and it has a cutter-type action. He shows some feel for a sinking changeup, though he doesnât throw it much, especially when heâs coming out of the bullpen. His lack of command and the lack of a consistent third pitch makes most thinking a relief role makes the most sense, with the potential to be a future closer.",1
"If you wanted to see the very top of the D-backs' NUMBER Draft class during their summer debuts, GPE in the short-season LOCATION was the place to go as first-rounder PERSON and ORGANIZATION B pick PERSON joined PERSON, the second-round pick out of PERSON, in a formidable lineup. PERSON got off to a good start, but tailed off in the second half.PERSON was teammates with ORGANIZATION. NUMBER overall pick PERSON, but it was PERSON who led PERSON in batting average, home runs and ORGANIZATION in NUMBER. He has the chance to hit for average and power and did so in the beginning of his debut before he struggled. He has easy raw power to all fields and has shown some feel to hit. He managed his strikeouts for the most part in college, drawing walks, and that carried over in GPE before he started to press and got out of his approach. Coming out of school, there were concerns about his defense, with some thinking he'd eventually move to first, but the D-backs were pleasantly surprised with how he handled the hot corner and don't have concerns about his future there.For PERSON to reach his potential as a power-hitting third baseman, he'll have to make sure he makes enough contact to tap into that power. The D-backs don't think there will be carry-over from his fade at the end of NUMBER in his first full pro season.",0
"The third player in the big R.A. Dickey trade with the ORGANIZATION back in December NUMBER that netted the ORGANIZATION and GPE d'Arnaud as well, PERSON's full-season debut in the ORGANIZATION system in 'NUMBER certainly made it look like that trade would be even more one-sided. While he showed some good things with the move up to the ORGANIZATION State League, a shoulder injury that nagged him all year shut him down in July and required surgery.Back and playing the outfield post-surgery, the hope was that PERSON would get get all of his offensive tools back. The shoulder may have caused his lower power output in GPE Lucie in NUMBER, and the ORGANIZATION felt that the lack of that threat caused him to become less patient at the plate, leading to a much lower walk rate. That improved a bit in NUMBER, but the strikeout rate has been high and he hasn't hit for average as he did a year ago. He is capable of making consistent hard line-drive contact. It may take some time for PERSON to be all the way back, especially to unleash what was an above-average arm in right field. He's a good athlete and covers a lot of ground from the corner outfield position. Assuming his shoulder does bounce back, there's no reason to think PERSON can't get back to profiling well as a future right fielder. He is still just NUMBER, with time to put it all together.",0
"PERSON flashed a mid-NUMBERs fastball in the ORGANIZATION during the summer of NUMBER, then pitched at NUMBER-NUMBER mph the following spring at ORGANIZATION. GPE signed him in the NUMBERth round for $NUMBER,NUMBER, but he blew out his elbow after a strong pro debut and missed the entire NUMBER season. He worked just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in his return to the mound last year, and that was enough to establish himself as the best lefty relief prospect in the system and earn a non-roster invitation to Spring Training.In his return, PERSON showed an at-times overpowering fastball and the potential for a plus slider. His heater sat at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and peaked at NUMBER, generating strikeouts as well as groundouts. His slider climbed into the high NUMBERs, though it can get slurvy at times.PERSON still has to prove he can carry that kind of stuff through a full season, but the FACILITY understandably are excited by the early stages of his comeback. He'll need to sharpen his control as well, though he shows some ability to work the bottom of the strike zone. If he's for real, he could become a late-inning option for GPE in the near future.",1
"PERSON was the best position player prospect on the ORGANIZATION' Gulf Coast League team that went NUMBER-NUMBER in NUMBER. The GPE native moved up to Class A Hagerstown in NUMBER and earned a spot on the LOCATION postseason All-Star team. He missed most of the first three months of the NUMBER season after breaking a finger on a slide during the opening week. PERSON's speed is his best tool and he uses it well on the bases and in the outfield. He stole NUMBER bases in NUMBER, the second most in full-season ball. But he doesn't just run indiscriminately. He has good instincts on the bases and will bunt for a hit. Defensively, he takes good routes and tracks down an impressive amount of fly balls in center field. While PERSON's speed and defense give him two plus tools, he'll have to prove himself offensively as he advances in the ORGANIZATION. He has some on-base skills and has a good approach at the plate, albeit without much power.",0
"The ORGANIZATION reportedly offered PERSON a $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus in NUMBER after drafting him in the first round, only to pull it off the table when PERSON. NUMBER overall pick PERSON's deal collapsed and the club no longer could afford PERSON with its reduced bonus pool. Both pitchers wound up with ORGANIZATION's (PERSON, Fla.) post-graduate program and were drafted once again in NUMBER, with PERSON going to GPE in the third round and signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER. He made strides on all fronts during his full-season debut, showing improved velocity, stuff and stamina, qualities that have followed him up the ladder to Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore in NUMBER.The Padres helped PERSON clean up his delivery late that season, and those adjustments have made him more consistent on all fronts. He sits NUMBER-NUMBER mph while reaching NUMBER with his fastball, all while showing increasing comfort with repeating his delivery. PERSON also made strides with his curveball, throwing it with more depth and sharper downward action that makes it a plus pitch in the eyes of evaluators. His changeup should at least be average, and he's adept at throwing strikes with all three pitches..PERSON answered questions about his durability last season by logging NUMBER innings as a NUMBER-year-old, and he has plenty of room left to grow into his athletic and projectable frame. He's a potential PERSON. NUMBER starter in the big leagues, especially if the changeup and his command continue to improve.",1
"PERSON appeared to be on his way toward becoming a first-round pick in the NUMBER GPE after a strong start to his junior season at GPE, only to miss most of April and May with a shoulder injury. But after he returned healthy and dominated in the weeks before the GPE, the A's felt good enough about his medicals to take him in GPE Round A with the NUMBERth overall pick. Assigned to Class A Advanced Stockton for his first full season, PERSON logged just two starts before it was announced he would need season-ending PERSON surgery. He returned to the mound the following July and picked up where he'd left off, striking out five batters over two scoreless innings in the Rookie-level PERSON League.When he's healthy, PERSON will add and subtract from his heater, sitting comfortably in the low NUMBERs but also reaching back for NUMBER mph, with feel for locating to both sides of the plate as well as down in the zone. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, a mid-NUMBERs offering thrown with fastball-like arm speed and late fading action, and he has the makings of a slider that should be at least Major League-average. A consistent, over-the-top release point allows him to create extension and angle toward the plate, and everything he throws plays up due to his advanced control and command. In general, PERSON should miss even more bats with improvement to both his changeup and slider.PERSON is a good athlete with clean arm action and a repeatable delivery. But as an undersized righty with a checkered medical history, he'll need to prove he can handle the rigors of a full season on the mound. If he can do so, PERSON' stuff, pitchability and deception could make him a No. NUMBER starter at the highest level. He's expected to return to game action sometime around the middle of the NUMBER season.",0
"Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER out of GPE in August NUMBER, PERSON is more steady than flashy, which led to him often getting overshadowed in a seemingly never-ending supply of ORGANIZATION middle-infield prospects. That began to change in NUMBER, when he challenged for the Double-A PERSON batting title at age NUMBER, hit .NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION playoffs and ranked as the best shortstop prospect in the ORGANIZATION. He was shot in the right hip during a robbery attempt in GPE in January and just NUMBER games this season before getting shut down with a back injury.Though GPE has played him at second and third base to enhance his versatility and to accommodate higher-profile prospects such as PERSON, there's no question that PERSON is a big league shortstop. He covers a lot of ground thanks to his smooth actions and keen instincts, and he has the plus arm to make all of the throws. He's also an asset at second and third base, and he's athletic enough to handle the outfield if asked.PERSON controls the strike zone well and makes consistent line-drive contact. While he can hit for average, his flat right-handed swing doesn't create much power and his ability to put the bat on the ball actually limits his walk totals. He'll turn in some plus run times out of the batter's box, but doesn't play quite that fast and hasn't shown much aptitude for stealing bases.",1
"PERSON won six games in his first three seasons at FACILITY, missing most of NUMBER with a back injury, before leading ORGANIZATION Division I with NUMBER victories as a redshirt junior this spring. After helping the ORGANIZATION to a NUMBER-NUMBER record and a third-place finish at the ORGANIZATION World Series, he signed with the ORGANIZATION for a slightly below-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER as a fourth-rounder.PERSON operates with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball as a starter, reaching as high as NUMBER with some armside run. He backs it up with a solid NUMBER-NUMBER mph slider with good bite, though it isn't as consistent as his heater. His changeup shows flashes of becoming an average offering but lags behind his other two pitches.After battling his control earlier in his college career, PERSON threw more strikes after simplifying his mechanics in NUMBER. He still doesn't have an especially clean delivery, so there's some thought that he may be better suited to become a reliever who could focus on his fastball and slider. He'll turn NUMBER shortly after his first pro season ends, so GPE likely will put him on the fast track.",0
"A reliever for most of his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION, PERSON transitioned well to the rotation, and his consistency as the ace of the ORGANIZATION' staff led to him being taken in the third round of the NUMBER Draft.PERSON has the makings of three average or better big league pitches. His fastball usually operates at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and peaks at NUMBER, and he can sink it, cut it or run it in on right-handers. PERSON can miss bats with his solid changeup, and he has some depth and power on his curveball.PERSON might have a little more velocity in him, because he has room to add strength on his tall frame and because he focused on filling the strike zone rather than cutting loose this year. He does a nice job of throwing strikes, but he gets hurt when he leaves his pitches up in the zone.",0
"PERSON got on a weighted ball program before the NUMBER season and, perhaps more as a result of the physical conditioning aspect of the program, began improving. His ascent continued, and accelerated, during a NUMBER that ended with a dynamite month and a half at ORGANIZATION, during which he struck out NUMBER hitters in NUMBER innings. 
PERSON's fastball plays up because he gets way down the mound and generates a lot of backspin on the ball, creating perceived rise. Changeup development seemed to occur in NUMBER, as the pitch was much different last year (NUMBER-NUMBER mph, at times with cut) than it was in NUMBER (NUMBER-NUMBER mph), and itâs fair to speculate that something like a grip change took place here. PERSON has two breaking balls that are both about average, though he uses the curveball pretty sparingly. Glove-side command of his cutter/slider makes him tough on righties. One source considers PERSON's delivery fairly easy to time because of its pacing, so maybe we need to see more curveballs as a way of disrupting timing. He projects as a No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter.",0
"The final pick (NUMBER,NUMBERth overall) in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON made one start in three college seasons at GSP. That was more a testament to the ORGANIZATION' incredible depth -- their NUMBER staff featured as many as five first-rounders and eight pitchers who could be big league starters -- and the ORGANIZATION planned on moving him to the rotation after selecting him in the third round that June. He made a smooth transition to starting in NUMBER, when he came to the ORGANIZATION as part of a July trade for PERSON has three solid pitches that can be plus offerings at their best. His NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball tops out at NUMBER and generates a lot of groundouts because of its sink and the angle he creates with his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. He has tremendous feel for his slider, a mid-NUMBERs weapon with late break that he also can morph into an upper-NUMBERs cutter. PERSON's changeup can be just as effective as his fastball and slider because it sinks and fades and he sells it well with his arm speed. He commands all three offerings and also has a curveball he can mix in to give hitters a different look. He has the look of a durable No. NUMBER starter and emerged as PERSON's best pitching prospect in less than a year after joining the organization.",0
"PERSON rose up ORGANIZATION boards in NUMBER as he started to register upper-NUMBERs readings on radar guns as the closer for LOCATION. He pitched very well in relief during his summer debut, but there are those who think he has the chance to start. His plus fastball out of the bullpen would still be above-average when stretched out and he commands it pretty well. His curve has shown glimpses of being an average breaking ball. His changeup is behind â he didnât need it much as a closer â but the Twins think it could give him a third average offering in time. He has upside as a starter or a reliever, though heâd likely get to the big leagues faster in the latter role.",0
"PERSON made his debut in GPE's top league as a NUMBER-year-old, batting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER as a part-time player in NUMBER-NUMBER. After he defected and PERSON expedited his free agency, the ORGANIZATION signed him in November for a $NUMBER million bonus and a matching amount as a tax penalty for exceeding their international pool. He began his pro career as the low Class A ORGANIZATION's youngest regular at age NUMBER, and he heated up in the second half after a slow start.The ORGANIZATION love PERSON's instincts at the plate. He has tremendous feel for the barrel and an advanced ability to recognize pitches and use the entire field. He flashes some raw power in batting practice and has the aptitude to translate it into game results.PERSON got rich because of his bat, not because of his athleticism or other tools. He has fringy speed and arm strength, though he has a good internal clock that helps him get the job done at second base and has led GPE to give him some time at shortstop during his pro debut. If he can't stay in the middle infield, third base or left field would be his fallback possibilities.",0
"PERSON was a standout at high school power ORGANIZATION, originally taken by the ORGANIZATION in the eighth round of the NUMBER Draft. He'd hit at pretty much every stop in GPE's chain, reaching Double-A in NUMBER, then was sent to the ORGANIZATION in January NUMBER as one of four players in return for another ORGANIZATION alum, GPE. PERSON excelled in Double-A for the first half of his first season with PERSON, then struggled after getting bumped up to Triple-A, earning a spot on the NUMBER-man roster in the process.More than anything, PERSON tried to do too much when he got moved to the ORGANIZATION' highest level. His swing got out of sync and he was often too quick, resulting in rolling over from being out in front too often. There is some power in the bat, power he has unlocked throughout his pro career, but it often can be his own worst enemy, as he can get pull-happy and ends up out in front. PERSON does run well enough to steal some bases, though not so efficiently, and his speed gives him range to play center, though his below-average arm might be better suited to left field if he's a regular.While PERSON has improved somewhat against left-handed pitching, most of his power comes against righties. He fits more of a fourth outfielder or platoon role, though if he shows he can adjust to Triple-A, he could prove he's more of a regular.",1
"ORGANIZATION's older brother PERSON was a hyped prospect that slid on draft day due to a down spring stemming from a back issue. PERSON missed most of his draft spring with a broken wrist and just returned last week. PERSON scouts told us he looked so rusty he may have been better off sitting out rather than giving teams a bad look just before the draft. At his best, ORGANIZATION shows at least average raw power, plus speed, some feel to hit and a center field profile.

Unforunately, he's barely had a chance to show that this spring and he was used irregularly from PERSON in the summer. Most teams' top scouts only scout players the NUMBER months of their eligible year, so teams with more history will lean on that to evaluate ORGANIZATION. In addition to this, GPE has geared his swing for opposite field liners and groundballs, along with having him bunt early in games batting near the top of the lineup. There's likely a swing change needed in pro ball, adding another 'if' to ORGANIZATION's situation.",0
"ORGANIZATION established a PERSON high school record with NUMBER straight scoreless innings as a sophomore, then missed his junior year after PERSON surgery before re-establishing himself as the state's best prep prospect as a senior in NUMBER. He turned down the FACILITY as a NUMBERst-rounder to attend PERSON, where he shuttled between the rotation and bullpen for three years. A full-time reliever since signing as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER, he reached Triple-A two years after turning pro and is on the verge of contributing in GPE is a rare reliever who uses four pitches. His best offerings are a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that peaks at NUMBER and features run and sink, and a curveball with good depth. He also employs a cutter/slider and a changeup with some tumble.While he lacks a true plus offering, ORGANIZATION throws all four of his pitches for strikes, mixes them well and generally keeps them down in the zone. With his extensive repertoire and fine control, it might be tempting to try him as a starter, but he had trouble maintaining the quality of his stuff when used in that role in college. He's a high-floor/low-ceiling reliever likely to fit in the middle innings in the big leagues.",0
"PERSON was one of the top two-way players in the college ranks leading up to the NUMBER First-Year Player Draft. In addition to playing right field and hitting in the middle of the order for PERSON, he also pitched out of the Titans bullpen. PERSON has a strong arm, running his fastball up to the mid-NUMBERs, and saved seven games for ORGANIZATION this spring. But professional scouts liked him more as a hitter, thanks to his powerful bat. He controls the strike zone well and could hit for a solid average to go with his pop. The ORGANIZATION picked PERSON in the third round and he quickly advanced to Class A Quad Cities after signing. The ORGANIZATION moved him to third base, where he saw some action at ORGANIZATION. He's made progress defensively, but is still learning his new position.",0
"PERSON was a two-way player at ORGANIZATION, winning the PERSON for his double duty, but the ORGANIZATION made him their first selection of the NUMBER Draft because of his ability on the mound. He's the quintessential college lefty, one who could move fairly quickly, especially now that he'll get to focus solely on one craft. He'll throw his fastball in the low NUMBERs and commands it very well. His best secondary pitch his his changeup, a plus offspeed pitch he trusts to throw at any count. He mixes in a curve that should be at least PERSON average. He's an excellent athlete who clearly handles the bat well, too. Having grown up around the game - his father is a Minor League pitching coach in the ORGANIZATION organization - certainly doesn't hurt his aptitude.",1
"PERSON spent his freshman year at ORGANIZATION (Okla.) before transferring to ORGANIZATION of GPE - PERSON ahead of his sophomore campaign. He showed improved stuff as a member of the starting rotation that spring, and the ORGANIZATION, intrigued by his present ability and potential, drafted him in the seventh round. After signing for above-slot at $NUMBER,NUMBER and forgoing a GPE commitment, PERSON had a successful pro debut between the Rookie-level Gulf Coast and Class A Short-Season New York-Penn Leagues. Listed at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, NUMBER pounds, PERSON has considerable physical projection remaining. His stuff is plenty good, too, as the quick-armed right-hander will reach NUMBER mph with his fastball while flashing a sharp, above-average curveball and showing feel for a changeup. PERSON has considerable physical projection remaining, though some scouts do worry about his ability to maintain velocity and work deep into games.Given his limited college track record and remaining physical projection, it shouldn't come as a surprise that PERSON's control and command are both below average. The ORGANIZATION, however, are excited about his upside, viewing him as a late-bloomer who has the potential to stick in the starting rotation.",0
"A two-way talent coming out of the GPE high school ranks, PERSON played the outfield and pitched briefly in relief for Stanford as a freshman. He left the mound behind for good as a sophomore and was a mainstay in the lineup in NUMBER and 'NUMBER, performing well enough to land in the third round, where the ORGANIZATION signed him for a slightly below pick value.PERSON's junior season didn't quite measure up to the bar he set with his All-Star performance in the ORGANIZATION PERSON the summer prior, though he did show off some of the offensive skills that made him intriguing in the first place. He is capable of barreling up the baseball, with an improved approach at the plate that saw him increase his walk rate considerably as a junior. That should enable him tap into his power more consistently, important for him to profile at an outfield corner. Because of his fringy speed and arm, PERSON has seen time in center and left field during his pro debut, but he is likely destined for the corner spot, so the bat will have to play enough for him to be a regular.Cape PERSON performance carries a lot of weight, and clearly the ORGANIZATION took notice. He went to short-season GPE to begin his pro career.",0
"PERSON raised his profile by homering off PERSON's PERSON during the summer of NUMBER, helping propel him into the third round of the next year's Draft. He reached Double-A at the end of his first full pro season but missed most of NUMBER with a strained rotator cuff that didn't require surgery. He returned last year to hit NUMBER homers in the Minors, then three more during his big league debut, as well as win a silver medal with the GPE Pan American Games team.PERSON is physically imposing and his most obvious tool is his well-above-average raw power, generated by a combination of bat speed, strength and loft in his right-handed swing. He sells out for home runs by getting pull-happy and overly aggressive, which could affect his consistency at the plate and will prevent him from hitting for a high average. Once his shoulder was NUMBER percent again, PERSON regained his solid arm strength and quick release, which he used to erase NUMBER percent of basestealers in NUMBER. He has cleaned up his receiving since entering pro ball and gets the job done well enough to be a big league regular. He offers little speed but moves well enough behind the plate.",1
"PERSON has been on radars since the ORGANIZATION gave him $NUMBER million to sign out of the ORGANIZATION. Hitting .NUMBER in his GPE debut didnât hurt and heâs tantalized with his skills since. PERSON appears to have put some of the attitude issues he had during his full-season debut in NUMBER behind him and it should be noted heâll still be just NUMBER years old for all of the NUMBER season. PERSON earned a promotion in NUMBER and his bat should help him continue to move up the ladder. He has above-average raw power and his approach at the plate has improved, giving him the chance to be an outstanding all-around hitter. Heâs always had a plus arm behind the plate, but there had been questions about his ability to handle the defensive rigors of the position in the past. He did seem to make some strides with the glove, though he needs to continue to work on his receiving skills, and the ORGANIZATION hope that can continue.",1
"The GPE named PERSON their Minor League Player of the Year in NUMBER, his first full professional season. Though he advanced to Double-A in NUMBER, his progress there was slowed by a broken hamate. That didn't deter the A's from acquiring him in December in exchange for PERSON.  PERSON stands out most for his hitting ability. He has a good approach at the plate and uses the whole field to hit, squaring up balls with his compact swing. He has more power than his size suggests and has proved capable of driving the ball over the fence everywhere he's gone. PERSON is a steady defender at second base, capable of making all the necessary plays. He earns praise for his makeup and blue-collar mentality, traits that have helped him rise through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Some teams thought PERSON had been buried by the pitching depth at ORGANIZATION and might be able to start in pro ball. A second round pick and $NUMBER.NUMBER million bonus were indicators that the ORGANIZATION might be one of them but, perhaps in part due to injury, he's only pitched in relief as a pro. He has a mid-NUMBERs sinker and plus changeup, which should enable him to pitch in middle relief.",0
"PERSON garnered a spot on the World roster for the NUMBER ORGANIZATION and impresses scouts with his combination of stuff and feel for pitching. It is now up to the ORGANIZATION -- who acquired him as a part of their return for PERSON in February NUMBER -- to hone those tools into PERSON talent.  PERSON throws his fastball in the low-NUMBERs with tailing action. His curveball flashes good potential, though his changeup is the more consistent of his two secondary offerings.  PERSON throws a lot of strikes, but he doesn't always repeat his delivery well and gets hit when he leaves the ball up in the zone. There's is a lot of potential in his lithe frame if he can harness it.",0
"Â The NUMBERth overall pick in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON has rebounded well since undergoing PERSON surgery and missing the 'NUMBER season. In NUMBER, he threw more than NUMBER innings for the first time in his career and he reached the GPE League.PERSON throws his fastball in the low-NUMBERs, and he regularly reaches back for a bit more velocity. Despite his relative inexperience, he has a plus changeup. PERSON's curveball needs more refinement, but it should give him another quality offering in time. He earns praise for his makeup and his confident demeanor on the mound.PERSON started the season strong before a groin injury sidelined him for two months. When he's healthy, he fits right in with the rest of the ORGANIZATION' top pitching prospects.",1
"Thompson-Williams played for two years at FACILITY CC before transferring in NUMBER to GPE and becoming the ORGANIZATION' fifth-round pick that June. After a nondescript pro debut that continued throughout his first full season, Thompson-Williams was one of six Minor Leaguers to record at least NUMBER homers and NUMBER stolen bases during a breakout NUMBER campaign, much of which he spent in the ORGANIZATION State League before receiving a late promotion to Double-A for the LOCATION playoffs. The ORGANIZATION took note of the performance, and ultimately acquired him, along with PERSON and PERSON, from the ORGANIZATION in the PERSON deal in November.Thompson-Williams has an intriguing blend of tools, most notable among them the power-speed combo that netted him the NUMBER homers and NUMBER steals that ranked first and third, respectively, among ORGANIZATION farmhands. He drives the ball to the big parts of the field, showing above-average power from the left side of the plate, though questions remain about his ability to make consistent contact and hit for average against advanced pitching.Above-average speed helps Thompson-Williams to make an impact on the basepaths as well as in center field, where scouts consider him to be an above-average defender with an average arm, one capable of playing all three outfield positions. The potential exists for Thompson-Williams to develop into an everyday player, though a fourth or fifth outfielder role is more realistic.",0
"One of the more polished prep pitchers in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON went NUMBER-NUMBER with a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA as a senior at FACILITY (Calif.) High en route to a second-round selection. After signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER, he recorded a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA as an NUMBER-year-old in the difficult pitching environments of the Rookie-level PERSON League.PERSON has the potential for three solid or better pitches once he's fully developed. His curveball is his best present offering, a NUMBER-NUMBER mph breaker with depth, and his high-three-quarters arm slot helps him stay on top of it consistently. With little effort in his delivery, he sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches NUMBER with his fastball, which features good downhill plane and some life.PERSON also demonstrates advanced feel for his tumbling changeup and isn't afraid to use it. He has sound mechanics and repeats them well, allowing him to throw strikes and work the bottom of the strike zone. He projects as a mid-rotation starter with the upside for more if he adds velocity as he gets stronger.",0
"A two-time member of the Pac-NUMBER All-Defensive Team during his time at GPE, PERSON's abilities in center field have never been questioned. His hitting ability, on the other hand, drew mixed reviews from scouts leading up to the NUMBER GPE. The ORGANIZATION, believing in his bat, took him in the third round of the GPE, and he rewarded them in his pro debut by finishing second in the Class A Short PERSON with a .NUMBER average. He made his full-season debut in 'NUMBER, splitting the year between the GPE and GPE, and then returned to the latter stop in NUMBER to earn All-Star honors before moving up to Double-A in July.A well-above-average runner and defender, PERSON makes it look easy in center field with his great jumps and exceptional range. That speed also makes him a threat on the basepaths, though he does have gains to make with both his technique and feel for reading pitchers. Offensively, PERSON has good bat speed from the right side of the plate, and he's shorter to the ball now after working with the ORGANIZATION to clean up his swing last summer. He should add some strength as he matures, which should lead to more gap power, but he's never going to be a home-run threat.Whether PERSON can reach his ceiling as a top-of-the-order center fielder will depend on how much his bat develops moving forward. Even if it doesn't, he still has a chance to be a big leaguer based on the merits of his speed-defense combo,",0
"PERSON had a seven figure asking price coming out of high school that was just out of reach for clubs. He was set to head to PERSON until a late coaching change and the ORGANIZATION lost PERSON to GPE and PERSON (lower on this list) to PERSON. PERSON's velocity ticked up before he even played in an official game for the GPE, sitting NUMBER-NUMBER and hitting NUMBER mph in preseason scrimmages before his freshman year. He's kept that velocity for the most part throughout his college career and he's also kept the plus changeup that he's had since back in high school. The two issues for PERSON are his very short stride, which causes his velocity to play down and secondly, his breaking ball. It's never been good and it got close to average with the velo spike improving his arm speed, but it's still most often a below average pitch, with curveball velocity and three-quarters slider shape.

A good pitching program may be able to tweak the pitch using ORGANIZATION or GPE in a pitch design type setting, or just scrap it altogether and try something like a cutter or slider. This is almost an identical issue to what PERSON had coming out of PERSON and he's largely solved it with the help of a good pitching program with the ORGANIZATION, so the team that picks PERSON could have a bigger influence in his outcome than most comparable talents.",0
"Sometimes power relief arms can be found in unlikely places. The Rockies think they may have found one in the NUMBERst round of the NUMBER Draft by way of Bethune-Cookman University.Armed with a hard sinking fastball that can touch the mid-NUMBERs, missing bats and inducing a ton of ground-ball outs, PERSON had a very successful first full season, even seeing some time as a closer. He complements the fastball with cutter/slider that has a ton of bite. PERSON's control improved in NUMBER compared to his summer debut, and his bulldog mentality is very well suited for short relief work.Pitchers who throw hard and keep the ball down in the zone have the chance to succeed in GPE, and it might not take PERSON too long to get there, with the chance to close games if his fastball command improves.",0
"The most touted GPE prospect since PERSON, PERSON joined his former national team teammate in the FACILITY organization when he signed for $NUMBER million in GPE (the FACILITY also paid a matching overage tax penalty). That's the second-highest bonus ever given to an amateur, behind only the $NUMBER.NUMBER million the ORGANIZATION paid PERSON two years earlier. PERSON has a long track record of success in international tournaments and GPE leagues, including batting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER as an NUMBER-year-old in GPE's PERSON in NUMBER.While they play different positions, PERSON has a lot of similarities to PERSON. A right-handed hitter, PERSON pairs electrifying bat speed that should translate into considerable power with well above-average speed. Both come with some swing-and-miss concerns, though PERSON's didn't really surface until he reached Double-A.Considered more of a solid runner when he defected, PERSON has gotten quicker and recorded sub-NUMBER.NUMBER second times in the NUMBER-yard dash. His lean NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame figures to add more muscle, so he probably will slow down some once he matures physically. He has a chance to remain in center field and enough arm strength to easily handle right field should he move to a corner.",0
"PERSON performed in Double-A and Triple-A in NUMBER and was added to the NUMBER-man this winter. He may have the raw stuff to start but his frame and stamina leave something to be desired, so he fits best in NUMBER-NUMBER inning stints. His fastball and slider are both above average, with the slider flashing plus at times, and his command has improved to be close to average, so there's plenty here for a left-handed middle reliever. Plus, he's big league ready.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION for $NUMBER,NUMBER in NUMBER, PERSON got off to a rough start at ORGANIZATION A GPE in NUMBER and continued to struggle after a demotion to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, resulting in another promotion back to the ORGANIZATION. But PERSON has gotten back on track this season in his return to GPE, where he's consistently missing bats and showing the ability to work deeper into games. The NUMBER-foot-NUMBER right-hander has big-time arm strength, working at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and topping out at NUMBER with his fastball, but his velocity is consistent because he struggles to repeat his delivery. That said, PERSON is just starting to grow into his wiry frame, and scouts envision him operating in the mid- to upper-NUMBERs once developed. His curveball has the makings of an average pitch, one thrown in the high NUMBERs with decent depth and shape, although his inconsistent release point compromises its effectiveness. PERSON's changeup is a work in progress, and he'll need to develop it thoroughly to remain a starter.PERSON's inconsistent mechanics and lack of a third pitch make him to difficult to project as a starter long term, but, at age NUMBER, he still has time on his side. At the worst, the right-hander's impressive arm strength and potential for two average-or-better pitches should allow him to carve out a late-inning bullpen role in the big leagues.",0
"PERSON had spent his first two years at ORGANIZATION as a starter at shortstop when he headed to PERSON for the summer. It was in that elite wood-bat league that he jumped much more firmly onto the GPE radar with an outstanding performance that led to an All-Star selection and playoff ORGANIZATION honors. He didn't fare as well as a junior, but still earned a third-round selection by ORGANIZATION in June. After a promising pro debut, PERSON broke out in earnest in his first full season, pacing the Class A ORGANIZATION in most offensive categories before moving up to Class A Advanced Dunedin in late May. After using his first pro offseason to revamp his swing, PERSON has been a different hitter in NUMBER, showing a shorter path to the ball and keeping his barrel in the zone for an extended period of time. It's allowed him to drive the ball with authority to all fields with consistency, and he's been able to hit for both average and surprising power as a result. PERSON's speed is only average, but he gets the most out of it on the basepaths, wisely picking his spots to steal.PERSON has the hands and instincts to remain at shortstop, where he profiles as average defender with solid range. His arm grades out as average, but he has a quick release and is always accurate, giving him the ability to play third base in addition to his usual work at short. Regardless of his ultimate defensive home, PERSON has shown in his first full season that he has the bat needed to become an everyday player at the highest level.",0
"PERSON's huge junior season at ORGANIZATION enabled him to become one of the best left-handers in the NUMBER Draft class and the highest-drafted player ever from the school when the ORGANIZATION took him No. NUMBER overall. His GPE career was short-lived, however. After pitching across three levels and throwing in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was the key to the PERSON deal with the ORGANIZATION this offseason.At the time, the trade brought in something PERSON sorely needed: an elite-level pitching prospect, one not that far from helping out in the big leagues. There were readings of PERSON's fastball touching triple digits in NUMBER and he'll sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range. Big and physical, he maintains that velocity and does so without too much effort. PERSON's curve has become a plus pitch, one that misses plenty of bats. His changeup gives him a third at least PERSON average offering.PERSON does have to cut down on his walks to reach his ceiling, but as a GPE guy who used to divide focus among two sports, he has more upside than your typical college arm. If the control improves, he could even outperform those Jon Lester comps.",0
"The ORGANIZATION had to wait patiently until GPE's NUMBERth birthday to sign him, which they did for $NUMBER,NUMBER in August NUMBER. He impressed as a NUMBER-year-old during his stateside debut in NUMBER, showcasing a promising blend of hitting ability and raw power, but was limited to just NUMBER games the following year due to a back injury. PERSON healthy in NUMBER, GPE has already turned in his longest season to date while playing for Class A Hagerstown.GPE is already loaded with upper-body strength and has plenty of room left to grow into his athletic and projectable frame. The right-handed hitter has a quick bat and generates good power to his pull side, and club officials believe he'll have at least average over-the-fence pop once fully developed. His issues with recognizing spin speak to his youth and inexperience, but the overall approach is advanced for his age and offers a solid foundation for offensive growth.After playing third base exclusively during the NUMBER-NUMBER seasons, GPE has seen increased time at first base this season, partly to ensure that he stays healthy. He has the makings of an average defender at both corner infield spots, with agility, range and a strong arm.",0
"Proctor started nearly every game in his three year career at ORGANIZATION at shortstop (alongside PERSON, a fellow Ray after a trade from GPE) and the steady performer peaked in his draft year. He's a decent shortstop with a chance to stick, but like many players in the ORGANIZATION system, he's on the spectrum between lock-down shortstop and second base-only. Proctor is near the bottom of the middle infielders on the list for now because the tools aren't impact (below average raw power, average speed, solid average arm), and the questions around his defense are more on range and explosiveness than hands or instincts. He's a flatter-planned, all-fields approach type who projects as a utilityman if the bat plays as expected, but one scout pointed out that this was almost exactly the report on PERSON a year ago, and foresees a similar rise for Proctor in NUMBER.",0
"A NUMBERth-round Draft pick in NUMBER out of ORGANIZATION, PERSON wasn't considered much of a prospect during his first three pro seasons. He changed that perception in NUMBER with a breakout performance at age NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION State League, and then he held his own the following year over a full season in the Double-A PERSON before a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION. Though he stands a diminutive NUMBER-foot-NUMBER, PERSON has excellent strength for his size and creates above-average bat speed from the right side. The result is sneaky power to all fields, though he does most of his damage to the pull side. That he finished third in walks in both the ORGANIZATION and EL in back-to-back years highlights his ability to control the strike zone and work deep counts, although his patient approach does lead to some swing-and-miss. PERSON' on-base skills also help him contribute on the basepaths, where his plus speed makes him a threat to steal NUMBER-plus bases annually. PERSON spent much of his time between the outfield corners before shifting to center field in NUMBER. Though he took quickly to the position and made overall strides as a defender in the process, he's likely to be a better long-term fit in left field on account of his below-average arm. ORGANIZATION hasn't produced a big leaguer since NUMBER, but PERSON could very well end that drought if he continues down his current path.",0
"There is no one in the Philliesâ system with more tools than GPE. The young shortstop has plus speed, an NUMBER on the NUMBER-NUMBER scouting scale, and it works for him on both sides of the ball. He led the organization in stolen bases in NUMBER and that was in a short-season league. But heâs far more than just a runner. GPE could develop into a plus hitter in time, one who hits .NUMBER annually at the big league level. He has a good approach at the plate and understands his job will be to get on base. The switch-hitter has some pop as well and eventually could have average power. He made a lot of progress at shortstop, a new position for him after playing the outfield in high school and he has the arm and range to be above-average defensively there. The sky might be the limit for GPE; now itâs all about reaching that ceiling as he moves toward GSP.",0
"ORGANIZATION started racing up ORGANIZATION boards as PERSON approached in NUMBER as he was touching NUMBER mph with his fastball. The ORGANIZATION love developing young pitching and took the GPE high school product in the second round, a bit ahead of where the industry had him. He had a solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION League.ORGANIZATION entered pro ball a bit on the raw side, but he has the makings of a very good three-pitch mix coming from an athletic build that has already shown the ability to take on strength. His fastball typically sits in the low NUMBERs and he throws it with good sink to get groundball outs. There is confidence he will add velocity as he physically matures. He has a good feel for his changeup already and there are glimpses of a solid curveball, though he can't always throw it for strikes. It may take some time, but ORGANIZATION's athleticism should allow him to repeat his delivery and find the strike zone consistently.The right-hander has already impressed with his makeup and work ethic, taking advantage of being from GPE and spending all offseason in GPE. He's already showing more strength, with a jump in stuff a strong possibility.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON the highest-drafted prep to come out of GPE, selecting him NUMBERth overall in NUMBER after he blew away the club's front office during a pre-Draft workout at PERSON. He's continued to impress with his pure stuff in the professional ranks, though the results have been uneven at times. The FACILITY decided to gamble on his upside, acquiring him and GPE right-hander PERSON in exchange for PERSON in July.Getting away from his low-three quarters arm slot in NUMBER cost PERSON both velocity and life on his fastball. PERSON and stronger in 'NUMBER, he looked more like his old self and operated at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with heavy life. His slider remains a plus pitch, one capable of inducing whiffs on both sides of the plate with its significant lateral break, and he'll also flash above average with his changeup, which has good sink and fade. PERSON' control continues to be below average, but he was markedly better in that regard in 'NUMBER, issuing a career-best NUMBER.NUMBER walk per nine innings, down from NUMBER.NUMBER the previous year. The jury is still out on whether he can remain a starter long term with his unique arm slot and underwhelming control profile.If he can't, he could have impact potential in a big league bullpen.",0
"When the A's acquired PERSON in December NUMBER as a part of the trade that sent PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION, he had just celebrated his NUMBERth birthday and was coming off an impressive stateside debut. He emerged as one of GPE's better pitching prospects in NUMBER and moved up to Double-A the following year, only to have his season all but wiped out by PERSON surgery in May. He returned to the mound last June at ORGANIZATION A Advanced GPE, but was held to a strict NUMBER-pitch/four-inning limit as he continued to work his way back from surgery.PERSON's velocity was down during his initial starts at GPE, but, by the end of the season, the right-hander was back sitting in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range and bumping NUMBER with his fastball. His changeup has above-average potential and complements his fastball well, and he'll also mix in a show-me curveball. His slider was inconsistent but showed the makings of becoming a third average-or-better offering up until he blew out his elbow. The A's didn't have him throw it in NUMBER, though, as they instead emphasized building up arm strength and regaining feel. Throwing strikes has never been a problem for PERSON, who has walked just NUMBER.NUMBER batters per nine innings as a professional.PERSON returned to PERSON in NUMBER but was inconsistent across his starts for GPE. He began to show signs of finally turning the corner in late July, which is when the A's promoted him to Triple-A. The right-hander had made significant strides in the year before his injury, and if he's able to fully recapture that ability and develop a more consistent breaking ball, he has a chance to become a solid Major League starter.",1
"Like many of the top catching prospects in the NUMBER Draft class, PERSON stood out more for his offensive prowess than his defensive abilities. Still, the ORGANIZATION liked his tools enough to take him with the NUMBERth pick overall.PERSON has a quick swing with a lot of leverage, giving him above-average power. He performed well on the high school showcase circuit last summer, highlighted by winning the home run derby at the ORGANIZATION in June. PERSON has a reliable approach and consistently makes hard contact.PERSON's plus arm is a definite asset behind the plate, though he needs to smooth out his transfer and accuracy. His receiving and blocking skills also will have to get better. PERSON moves better than most catchers and should be able to transfer to an outfield corner if needed.",0
"GPE aggressively, PERSON reached the Class A Advanced California League in NUMBER at age NUMBER. The ORGANIZATION think he can develop into a top-of-the-order catalyst in the future.PERSON's best tool is his speed, and he has more than enough to be a threat on the basepaths and to give him range up the middle. The GPE switch-hitter's actions and his arm are good enough for shortstop, but he's also seen time at second base thus far in his pro career. PERSON has no power to speak of, relying on making contact and using his speed for his offense. Some added strength and improvement of his on-base skills will certainly help him down the road.If the bat can come along, PERSON has the chance to be an everyday shortstop, though a career as a speedy and dynamic utility type is nothing to sneeze at.",1
"PERSON experienced the worst full pro season of his career in NUMBER, when he batted .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER in Double-A. Rediscovering his plate discipline and shifting to the middle infield upped his prospect profile in NUMBER.PERSON won't hit for average because his left-handed swing gets long and he never has made consistent contact as a pro. But he still can contribute offensively because his bat speed produces power and his patient approach yields plenty of walks. He ranked among the ORGANIZATION leaders in free passes in NUMBER.After playing six positions during his NUMBER pro debut, PERSON spent most of the next three seasons at third base and much of NUMBER in right field. He focused on second base and shortstop in NUMBER, and while he's not as quick as a typical middle infielder, he has decent range and can make plays with his strong arm. He could have a future as a utilityman with strong secondary skills at the plate.",0
"One of the big international signings in NUMBER, the ORGANIZATION inked PERSON for just over $NUMBER million in July of that year. The GPE outfielder made his GPE debut in NUMBER in the ORGANIZATION, playing right field for PERSON. He was a bit overmatched there, but heâs a good athlete with outstanding bat speed. While more of a line-drive hitter now, he should have more than enough power to profile well in the outfield corner. PERSON also has enough arm to play in right. The question is just how much, and how quickly, his overall hitting will develop, but if it all comes together, he has the chance to be a prototypical run-producing right fielder at the big league level.",0
"PERSON has less mileage on his arm than most pitching prospects. He was better known as an outfielder in high school, and he worked just NUMBER innings in two seasons as a reliever at ORGANIZATION. Signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a Draft-eligible sophomore after being taken in the second round in NUMBER, PERSON pitched just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER frames in his first two seasons as a pro, the FACILITY acquired him in a late-August trade that sent PERSON to the Athletics.. PERSON reached NUMBER mph as a college reliever, and he can throw his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball by hitters up in the zone. His low-NUMBERs curveball has good depth, and at times it gives him a second power pitch. PERSON can also display a tight slider and a sinking changeup, giving him more than enough options to start.Because of concerns about PERSON's command and durability, GPE decided to move him to the bullpen. His ability to locate his pitches and keep his pitch counts down are less impressive than his pure stuff.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, PERSON spent his first four seasons in GPE ball before showing signs of breaking out in NUMBER. The left-hander made good on that breakout last year in his full-season debut, as he paced PERSON hurlers in strikeouts (NUMBER) and strikeouts per nine (NUMBER.NUMBER) while ranking second in opponents average (.NUMBER). Assigned to Class A Advanced Dunedin to begin NUMBER, PERSON had produced mixed results before landing on the disabled list in July with an undisclosed injury. A NUMBER-foot-NUMBER left-hander, PERSON uses his height to create downhill plane with his fastball, which can touch NUMBER mph but typically sits in the low NUMBERs with late life. Scouts believe he will eventually sit in the mid-NUMBERs once he's grown into his lanky frame and learned to harness his long limbs during his delivery. His sharp, low-NUMBERs slider is inconsistent but will flash average, thrown with depth and tilt, and improving his nascent changeup is sure to be a focal point in his future development.PERSON's below-average control and fringy secondaries leave much to be desired, but he has enough deception and natural movement to generate whiffs and weak contact even when he misses a spot. That could change as he's challenged by more advanced hitters at higher levels, leading some to believe he'll wind up in the bullpen.",0
"The ORGANIZATION. NUMBER prospect on MLBPipeline.com's international prospect list for the NUMBER-NUMBER signing period, PERSON signed for $NUMBER million -- the largest bonus in a ORGANIZATION spending spree that totaled more than $NUMBER million. Considered the best power prospect in that international class, he didn't go deep in his NUMBER pro debut but ranked second in the Rookie-level GPE League with NUMBER homers last summer.PERSON has exceptional bat speed and strength that create raw power which earns top-of-the-scale grade from some evaluators. He's as raw as he is powerful, however, as he has a long way to go with recognizing pitches, handling offspeed offerings and making consistent contact. He topped the ORGANIZATION with NUMBER strikeouts and a NUMBER percent whiff rate while also ranking second-to-last with a .NUMBER batting average.A classic boom-or-bust type, PERSON will have to deliver on his prodigious power potential to have a big league career. He has a strong arm but is a well below-average runner with limited range and has provided erratic defense at third base. Though he's working to improve his agility and glovework, he probably will wind up at first base.",0
"After an exciting full-season debut in NUMBER, PERSON's numbers took a step back when he moved up to Double-A in NUMBER as he admittedly tried to do too much when he struggled. He did have some stretches of success, then finished things off with a solid ORGANIZATION campaign. PERSON's best tool is his plus speed, which allows him to be a terrific center fielder as well as a major basestealing threat, though he needs to learn to be more efficient on the basepaths. He has an understanding that his job is to be a catalyst at the top of the lineup, one who can get on base and let his speed work for him. He has a line-drive swing with some extra-base power. With PERSON signed to a four-year deal, PERSON's path to GPE isn't as clear, though he did play some left field in the AFL.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON entered his Draft year in NUMBER as a potential first-round pick, but an uneven season removed him from Friday night duties at ORGANIZATION. He did perform better near the end of the season, leading to his selection in the second round by the ORGANIZATION. PERSON then pitched well during his pro debut, posting a NUMBER/NUMBER K/BB over NUMBER innings in the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League.A NUMBER-foot-NUMBER left-hander, PERSON works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball, scraping NUMBER-NUMBER. His breaking ball also grades out as at least a Major League offering, thrown with some sharp downward tilt that induces whiffs from both sides of the plate. PERSON's changeup gives him a third average offering to choose from, and he throws everything from the same deceptive arm slot. He struggled with his command at times in his junior season, though that was less of an issue during his pro debut.PERSON missed his last couple starts during the regular season due to general arm fatigue, but he was healthy enough to participate in the team's fall instructional league -- sans game action. The ORGANIZATION believe PERSON is someone they can challenge moving forward, though he's been sidelined for much of NUMBER with left biceps tendinitis.",0
"PERSON pitched just NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER innings in four years of college split between PERSON and PERSON, and he missed all of NUMBER following PERSON surgery. Yet the ORGANIZATION saw enough to draft him in the NUMBERst round in NUMBER and signed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER. Barely a year after turning pro, he reached high Class A. Strictly a reliever, PERSON works primarily with two pitches. His fastball sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches NUMBER, playing up thanks to its late movement, and his hard slider also misses bats. He has begun working on a changeup to give hitters something offspeed to think about, though it's very much a work in progress.PERSON had problems finding the strike zone at times in college, but his control and command have been much more impressive early in his pro career. At the rate he's progressing, he could bolster the GPE bullpen in the near future. He has a ceiling of a set-up man.",0
"Most conversations about PERSON begin with his bat, and for good reason. He has the chance to hit his way to the big leagues.PERSON has already shown the ability to hit for average from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach and a smooth left-handed swing. There's more power to come, and it should be noted that PERSON had the same amount of home runs with PERSON that PERSON hit there, and PERSON did it in fewer games. While he will never be known for his glovework, the ORGANIZATION feel PERSON has gotten a bad rap for his defense and that he is more than just a bat being hidden in left field.That said, PERSON's ability to swing the bat is his calling card, and he has the chance to develop into a run producer at the highest level.",0
"A NUMBERrd-round pick in NUMBER out of ORGANIZATION II GPE, PERSON began his career as a starter, earning mid-season All-Star honors with PERSON before advancing to the Class A Advanced California League in his first full season. He returned to the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER, this time as full-time reliever, and promptly turned in a breakout campaign as part of a loaded Modesto bullpen and furthered that success in the ORGANIZATION. A candidate to move quickly in NUMBER, PERSON instead has spent much of the season on the disabled list with a sore right shoulder.PERSON's stuff has ticked up out of the bullpen, where he'll operate with a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that previously sat in the low-NUMBERs as a starter. The pitch has late life, which enables him to pitch effectively up in the zone, and he complements it with a hard, late-breaking slider that serves as a swing-and-miss out pitch, and a less-consistent curveball. PERSON's changeup was a pitch he had focused on developing as a starter, though that has become a bit of a moot point after his move to the bullpen. PERSON's struggles in consistently repeating his high-effort delivery result in below-average control and too many free passes, some of which he's able to offset with his ability to induce whiffs. Both his stuff and feel require further refinement in the high Minors, but the overall profile is that of a seventh- or eighth-inning reliever.",0
"PERSON PERSON gets the typical labels of being a ""real baseball player"" and a ""gamer,"" as he's a gritty, hard-nosed type. He also has shown an ability to hit. After hitting .NUMBER in college, he hit .NUMBER during his pro debut and then hit .NUMBER during his first full season. The left-handed hitter gets on base and rarely strikes out. He has fringy speed but has excellent instincts on the basepaths. His arm is just OK, but he should be solid defensively at second base. He may never wow anyone, but he's exactly the kind of grinder who finds his way into a big league lineup.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"The ORGANIZATION went all in during the July NUMBER international signing period, spending close to $NUMBER million on a pair of GPE prospects, shortstop PERSON and PERSON. Primarily a reliever when he pitched in GPE, he would not have been ranked No. NUMBER on MLBPipeline.com's Top NUMBER ORGANIZATION list nor would he have gotten $NUMBER.NUMBER million from GPE if people didn't think he had the goods to start.PERSON has an outstanding fastball-curveball combination that certainly would play up in a relief role. But he has the chance to develop into a solid rotation piece. His fastball will sit in the low-NUMBERs and he can reach back for NUMBER-NUMBER mph. His curve is a plus breaking ball and he commands both of them well. The ORGANIZATION haven't seen a changeup enough since he joined the organization, but he has shown a good feel for it in the past and it should be PERSON average.PERSON has already impressed with his work ethic as he prepares to make his professional debut. He's tasked with developing as a starter at a full-season level, with the organization knowing he could move more quickly out of the bullpen if needed.",0
"Over the course of multiple Drafts, the ORGANIZATION aggressively went after high-risk, high-reward high school pitching in later rounds. GPE was one of those picks, given an above-slot deal in NUMBER. He might be the first from that crop to impact the big league rotation.At first glance, it might be easy to put the ""mid-rotation"" label on GPE, but there might be more than meets the eye. He has more velocity on his fastball, hitting the mid NUMBERs regularly, than the typical command-and-control starter. GPE's changeup has improved so much that it might be his second-best offering, and his curve gives him three Major League average or better pitches in his repertoire.It all comes from GPE's big NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame and clean delivery. He has improved every year that he's been with the ORGANIZATION, and he is poised to knock on the door in NUMBER.",0
"PERSON PERSON wasn't the only potential star the ORGANIZATION signed during the NUMBER-NUMBER international signing period. They believed PERSON was the best pitcher available on the amateur market when they paid him $NUMBER.NUMBER million, doubling the ORGANIZATION bonus record PERSON had set in NUMBER. He proved better than initially expected during his NUMBER pro debut, advancing to low Class A at age NUMBER and reaching NUMBER mph with his fastball. But it will now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further the youngster's development after they acquired him from PERSON for PERSON during the NUMBER All-Star break. Because of PERSON's small stature, big stuff and precocious command, he draws some extreme comparisons to PERSON. With little effort in his delivery, he usually works at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball. Both PERSON's tight curveball and sinking changeup are more advanced than those of the typical teenager, showing the potential to become plus pitches.PERSON repeats his mechanics well, which allows him to put his pitches where he wants. The only question at this point is whether his slight build will allow him to hold up over the course of a long season. PERSON carefully managed his workload early in his career, and that's likely to remain the case as a member of the ORGANIZATION.",0
"After giving up a potential future as a college football quarterback following his sophomore year, PERSON's baseball stock took off and he developed into one of the toolsier high school players in the NUMBER Draft class. The ORGANIZATION got him in the ORGANIZATION, but his pro debut ended with a hamstring injury in just his second Gulf Coast League game.When healthy, PERSON's bat speed, strength and leverage give him some serious raw power. He struggled a bit last summer on the showcase circuit, as an arm bar in his right-handed swing contributed to him getting out of sync. He was able to refine his mechanics during his senior season though, and was more consistent as a result, using the entire field and quieting concerns about his ability to hit enough to tap into that power.PERSON runs well, though he could lose a half-step as he fills out. A center fielder in high school, he played right in his one game in the field in the ORGANIZATION, where his plus arm would play extremely well. He'll get the chance to truly show what he can do in NUMBER.",0
"An athletic, toolsy outfielder when the ORGANIZATION drafted him in NUMBER, PERSON turned that promise into production in a breakout NUMBER season. He was named the ORGANIZATION of the Year after posting a .NUMBER ORGANIZATION, collecting NUMBER hits and scoring NUMBER runs in NUMBER games between Class A Quad Cities and Class A Advanced Lancaster. In his first two years in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON looked more like a top-of-the-order hitter thanks to his patience, contact-oriented approach and speed. A tweak to his swing allowed him to tap into newfound power this season. After not homering in his first two years as a professional, he hit NUMBER in NUMBER, including a stretch where he homered in five straight games. He's an above-average runner, giving him an intriguing power-speed combination. PERSON' speed gives him a chance to stick in center field, though some scouts think he's better suited defensively for right field. His strong arm will play well at either position.",0
"After signing for $NUMBER.NUMBER million as a fourth-round pick in NUMBER, PERSON developed more slowly than expected. He didn't reach full-season ball until NUMBER and struggled when he got there, posting a NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in NUMBER starts in low Class A. This year he has looked more like the pitcher the ORGANIZATION thought they were signing, earning a promotion to high Class A after a month.PERSON has reclaimed the fastball velocity he displayed in high school, working at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and topping out at NUMBER repeatedly this year. His heater can be very tough to hit when he uses his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame to drive it down in the strike zone. His hard knuckle-curve can generate swings-and-misses as well.Though PERSON still has work to do with his changeup, it shows signs of becoming a usable third option. He's doing a better job of throwing strikes this year, which bodes well for his chances of remaining a starter at higher levels.",0
"Primarily a reliever in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION, PERSON raised his profile when he led the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts (NUMBER) and strikeout rate (NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings) in the summer of NUMBER. He entered last year as a projected top-two-rounds pick before missing six weeks with shoulder soreness that cast doubts on his health and signability. The ORGANIZATION gambled a NUMBERth-round choice on him and surprisingly landed him for $NUMBER,NUMBER.PERSON's changeup is his best offering and he has supreme confidence in it, throwing it with deceptive arm speed and nice fade. His fastball sat in the low NUMBERs when he started and has parked at NUMBER-NUMBER mph since he became a full-time reliever in June, with heavy sink when he keeps it down in the strike zone. His slurvy slider can be effective at times but lags behind his other two offerings.PERSON had enough pitches and command to make it as a starter, but he'll move faster as a reliever. Some scouts aren't enamored of his size, arm action and lack of track record, all factors that pointed him toward a bullpen role.",0
"PERSON's double play partner at ORGANIZATION, PERSON, may have generated more buzz and went in the first round of the NUMBER Draft, PERSON had a strong spring of his own and landed in the second round, NUMBER picks after his teammate.The infielder let his bat do most of the talking, sitting atop the ORGANIZATION batting average leaderboard for much of the spring. PERSON uses a quick, short stroke to spray line drives to all fields. He has an outstanding approach at the plate and is an on-base machine. PERSON isn't a part of his game, which is fine for a hitter who profiles as a top-of-the-order catalyst. PERSON uses his plus speed to take extra bases and he should be a base-stealing threat in the future. A center fielder in the past, PERSON has the skills to play second base as well as the athleticism to return to the outfield if need be. The ORGANIZATION sent PERSON out as a second baseman for his pro debut, letting him go straight to full-season ball. He's the kind of advanced bat that could move fairly quickly.",0
"A big international signing by the ORGANIZATION in July NUMBER, PERSON had excited GPE about his potential. The ORGANIZATION are clearly also intrigued, obtaining the young ORGANIZATION lefty in a January trade with the ORGANIZATION.While some might be concerned that PERSON isn't the biggest guy in the world, his stuff and feel for pitching point to a future in a rotation, even if that big league future is still far off in the distance. He has a relatively simple and clean delivery that allows him to throw strikes, though he's still working on repeating it consistently. PERSON can locate his fastball to both sides of the plate, a skill that doesn't often come until much later for prospects. His curveball is his go-to pitch, though he can fall in love with it too much. He has a feel for a changeup, but it's behind the other two offerings.PERSON has grown some, both in height and weight, and he might not be done growing, though his size might be the only thing that's not projectable about him.",0
"PERSON parlayed a strong career as a starter at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, including a championship in his sophomore year, into becoming a second round pick in the NUMBER Draft. Thought to be a quick-to-the-big leagues college performer, things didn't go quite as planned, though he did lead the ORGANIZATION in groundout-to-airout ratio and had the best ground ball ratio of any pitcher in baseball, including the big leagues.PERSON has plenty of fastball, typically in the low-NUMBERs, but it plays up move because of his plus plus sink and his ability to get outs early in counts as a result. He does have usable secondary weapons and understands how to pitch soft, but doesn't always use it effectively. His slider is ahead of his curve, and he has good feel for a changeup, but trusting all of it has been an issue. He's smoothed out his delivery somewhat since his college days, but is still working to repeat it consistently. That's led to more control issues than anticipated, with a NUMBER.NUMBER BB/NUMBER rate in his first full season.With the potential to have a usable three or four-pitch mix, PERSON still has the chance to be a back-end starter. If it doesn't come together, his sinker-slider combination could look awfully good coming out of the bullpen.",0
"PERSON has been part of two very strong prospect return packages for relievers. First, he and PERSON were sent from GPE to GPE for PERSON. Then he and ORGANIZATION were traded to GPE for PERSON last year. 
After dealing with severe injury issues as an amateur -- he suffered from a strained UCL in high school and had a screw put in his elbow as a college freshman after suffering two humeral fractures -- as well as more minor maladies as a pro, PERSON was healthy for all of NUMBER and threw more innings in a single season than at any point in his career. He struck out NUMBER hitters in NUMBER innings at Double-A. He remains a fairly spotty strike-thrower, but his three-pitch mix should enable him to continue to start, though probably as a NUMBER or NUMBER-inning type rather than a true workhorse, which also makes sense considering PERSON's health history. He has rare lefty starter velocity and generally sits NUMBER-NUMBER. A NUMBER mph average fastball would rank third among southpaw starters in baseball, just behind PERSON and PERSON. PERSON can dump in his average curveball for strikes and his changeup has slowly turned into an average pitch, too. The cambio may yet have some developing to do as PERSON worked more heavily off his breaking ball early in his career and has lost a lot of reps due to injury. He profiles as a fastball-centric No. NUMBER or NUMBER starter for us, though there's a large subset of teams who think he ends up in the bullpen.",0
"The ORGANIZATION lost their top two picks in the NUMBER Draft as compensation for free-agent signings, making PERSON their top selection. He was a part of three GPE state championship teams at ORGANIZATION McCarthy High School, the same school that produced big leaguers PERSON and PERSON Castellanos.While PERSON doesn't have overpowering stuff, he is more polished than most high school pitchers. His fastball sits around NUMBER mph, with good life. At his best, PERSON throws from a good downhill angle and adds run to the pitch. He has good feel for his changeup and gets good depth to his curveball.PERSON stands out for his control and pitchability. With time, his strong build, stuff and polish could help him develop into a solid Major League starter.",0
"PERSON pitched well enough as a starter to get drafted by the Brewers after each of his two seasons at FACILITY in GPE in NUMBER and 'NUMBER, but his career took off when he moved to the bullpen after transferring to GPE in 'NUMBER. PERSON selected him in the fourth round that June, and he has cruised through the Minors ever since, reaching Double-A two years later.PERSON pitches off a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that reaches NUMBER mph. He's very tough on left-handers, neutralizing them with a hard slider. PERSON is less effective against righties, and his below-average changeup doesn't help much in that regard.PERSON's control has gotten better each year since he turned pro, but he will have to do a better job of locating his pitches against more advanced hitters. His ceiling lies somewhere between lefty specialist and setup man.",0
"There are few, if any, high school bats better than ORGANIZATION's. With a balanced approach and a smooth swing from the left side, he projects to be a plus hitter with above-average power.He's an average runner, at best, and will be limited to a corner outfield spot, but that's just fine, as his bat will play there without question.The only thing that might be better than his hitting skills is his makeup. He plays the game the right way and is very competitive.ORGANIZATION's character combined with his bat should get him off the board fairly early.",0
"PERSON played high school ball with the NUMBERth overall pick in last year's draft, PERSON, and PERSON has become PERSON's legal guardian. PERSON has been into the low NUMBER's with three pitches and command that all flash above average at times, though he's had some trouble with consistency to his stuff.",0
"Signed at age NUMBER out of the ORGANIZATION for just $NUMBER,NUMBER in May NUMBER, PERSON had a relatively non-descript pro debut in the ORGANIZATION that year. PERSON's GPE debut in 'NUMBER, however, which saw him play in both the ORGANIZATION and GPE, put him much more firmly on the prospect radar, and he made a nice transition to full-season ball in 'NUMBER. In GPE, the ORGANIZATION dealt him with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION. Tall, lean and athletic, PERSON screams projection. At the plate, he's shown the ability to hit the ball hard to all fields from the right side. His impressive hand-eye coordination allows him to find the barrel consistently, though he'll have to improve his plate discipline to continue hitting for average. That will also allow him to tap into his raw power, which is sure to show up even more as he fills out his NUMBER-foot-NUMBER frame. PERSON played some shortstop initially after signing, but he's settled in at third base, where his arm and defensive actions have the chance to work long-term.PERSON is still an unfinished product, but his upside is undeniable and he's already flashing pretty impressive tools. With some patience, he could develop into a very solid player at the hot corner.",0
"PERSON became a full-time catcher in the summer before his senior season at GPE (GPE) PERSON and showed enough promise to earn top-five-rounds consideration in the NUMBER PERSON, though he went unpicked because he was strongly committed to GPE. He was the regular catcher on the ORGANIZATION' 'NUMBER PERSON Series team as a freshman before splitting time behind the plate while also seeing action at first and third base as a sophomore and junior. The ORGANIZATION made him their sixth-round pick in the 'NUMBER PERSON, and then saved money by signing him for below slot value. He had a solid first full season in the ORGANIZATION A GPE ORGANIZATION and opened 'NUMBER at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Potomac.PERSON's most impressive tool is his plus raw right-handed power, which he generates with a combination of bat speed and strength. The question is how much he'll be able to tap into that pop in pro ball because he often tries to do too much at the plate and pull every pitch out of the park. That said, PERSON has toned down his approach to handle pro pitching, showing improved contact skills and less swing-and-miss tendencies.GPE played PERSON on the infield corners, more because of team need than any lack of ability at catcher. He's a bottom-of-the-scale runner but moves well enough behind the plate to remain there. His receiving and blocking skills have improved since entering the ORGANIZATION' system, and he's continued to show a solid, accurate arm with sound catch-and-throw skills.",0
"The ORGANIZATION went over-slot value to land PERSON in the supplemental second round in NUMBER, giving the GPE prep hurler $NUMBER million to forgo his commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE. He pitched for two seasons in GPE's system before being shipped to the ORGANIZATION with PERSON in December NUMBER. While the right-hander progressed nicely in GPE's system before breaking out in NUMBER, when his improved stuff and bat-missing ability led to a dominant early-season showing with PERSON followed by a promotion to Class A Advanced Carolina in May and a bump up to the Double-A level roughly a year later. PERSON's fastball typically sits in the low NUMBERs with late life, at times bumping NUMBER mph, and there should be more velocity to come as he continues to add strength to his projectable frame. He's learned to throw more downhill since being drafted, but needs to be even more consistent at it given his natural fly-ball tendencies. The ORGANIZATION laud PERSON's feel for spinning the ball, as he shows present feel for locating a potentially above-average curveball, as well as his aptitude for throwing a fading changeup. PERSON's progress in developing his three-pitch mix showed in NUMBER, as he held hitters to a .NUMBER average while piling up NUMBER strikeouts over a career-high NUMBER NUMBER/NUMBER frames. PERSON still requires quite a bit of physical projection, needs to improve his fastball command and further refine his secondaries, but he could be a durable mid-rotation starter with three Major League average-or-better pitches when all is said and done.",0
"PERSON didn't start pitching until his junior year of high school, but he was quickly into the low-NUMBERs and the ORGANIZATION made a late-round run at him in NUMBER. He didn't sign, and instead ended up in GPE's bullpen, where his velocity climbed into the mid-NUMBERs. Late in April of his junior year, PERSON had forearm issues that ended his college season and drove him down draft boards, but he's been healthy and dominant in pro ball, and had a minuscule NUMBER.NUMBER ERA in the ORGANIZATION before he was sent to GPE in the ORGANIZATION trade. Though he'll occasionally snap off a plus slider, a crackling, upper-NUMBERs two-seamer is PERSON's best pitch, and he milks it for all it's worth, throwing it nearly NUMBER% of the time. It has devastating armside run because of his lower slot, and it's the driving force behind his absurd NUMBER% ground ball rate. The delivery remains a cause for concern, but of all the obvious, relief-only prospects in this system, we think PERSON has the best chance to turn into a high-leverage option.",0
"PERSON received a $NUMBER million bonus as a NUMBER supplemental first-rounder and then impressed in his professional debut the following year, finishing in Double-A. He wasn't able to repeat that success over the next three seasons, but managed to resuscitate his career in NUMBER and ultimately reached the Majors for the first time in early August. PERSON showed more of the blend of tools and polish last year that he did at the onset of his career. He has a patient approach, knows how to get on base and, at his best, uses the whole field to hit. He creates decent bat speed and has improved against left-handed pitching, although there's still a fair amount of swing-and-miss in his game.Defensively, PERSON's speed, arm strength and instincts make him a solid defender capable of playing all three outfield spots. He should continue to serve as a fourth outfielder moving forward after getting his first taste of the big leagues.",0
"A NUMBERth-round pick out of high school by the GPE, PERSON didn't get much work as a Texas A&M freshman, but he became nearly unhittable coming out of the bullpen as a sophomore last year. He continued to dominate for the first month of his junior season, putting himself in position to be one of the first relievers selected. A dip in velocity caused his stock to drop a bit, with the ORGANIZATION nabbing him in the fifth round. Early in the year, PERSON sat at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and reached NUMBER with his lively fastball. He worked more at NUMBER-NUMBER mph when he slumped, topping out at NUMBER on some days and just NUMBER on others. He had one of the best curveballs in the GPE, a power downer that can climb into the mid NUMBERs, though it too was less sharp in the latter part of the season.PERSON also has a changeup with some sink and deception, but he's likely a reliever long-term because of command and delivery concerns. The ORGANIZATION kept him in the bullpen, and he advanced to full-season ball during his summer debut.",0

"A two-sport athlete in high school, PERSON didn't pitch much before popping onto scouts' radars late in the NUMBER Draft process. His raw stuff and projectability made him an intriguing project, he delivered promising results in the GPE League in his first full professional season, though struggled with the move to full-season ball in NUMBER.PERSON's fastball sits in the low NUMBERs, and he often shows even more velocity. He gets a lot of sinking action from his three-quarters arm slot and generates an incredible number of groundballs as a result. His slider gives him a solid second offering, and his nascent changeup shows promise.PERSON remains raw, and while he's made some strides with his delivery, he still has a ways to go in his development as a starter.",0
"One of the youngest players in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON didn't turn NUMBER until three months after he signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER as an eighth-round pick. He spent most of his first two pro seasons in GPE ball before making a strong impression during his full-season debut in NUMBER.PERSON has one of the purest bats in the ORGANIZATION system. He employs a compact left-handed swing that sprays line drives to all fields and has a knack for working counts. His approach doesn't result in a lot of power, though he can sting the ball into the gaps on occasion.PERSON has solid speed but still is learning how to apply it on the bases and in the outfield. A center fielder in NUMBER and NUMBER, he has played mostly left field this season. His below-average arm precludes him from seeing action in right field.",0

"GPE (N.Y.) PERSON has produced an ORGANIZATION wide receiver (PERSON) but never a baseball PERSON pick, but that will change in NUMBER. PERSON emerged as a potential first-rounder with a succession of strong performances late in the summer on the showcase circuit. He lived up to that billing by continuing to swing a good bat as spring came to the Northeast.PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate for a high schooler from a cold-weather state, and his strength and bat speed could produce above-average right-handed power. His pure speed is his best tool, grading as a legitimate plus. PERSON's wheels also give him plenty of range in center field, and he has a better arm than most players at that position. He has committed to Wake GPE.",0
"GPE was one of the best college closers in the country during his stint in that role at GPE in NUMBER and NUMBER, racking up NUMBER saves in those two seasons. Reaching Double-A in his first full season of pro ball, he both closed and set up along the way.Despite standing at just six-feet, NUMBER pounds, GPE has the kind of electric stuff teams like to have in the back end of a bullpen. His fastball will sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range with big-time boring action. His slider gives him a second above-average pitch, with quick and late bite. Both miss plenty of bats and GPE also does a good job of inducing groundball outs. He'll even mix in a changeup to keep hitters honest and while he doesn't need it much, he has some feel for it. The biggest thing holding GPE back is his command. He walked NUMBER.NUMBER per nine innings in NUMBER, a rate that will have to improve he wants to close games at the next level. At worst, he could serve as a very effective setup man in the near future.",0
"The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft out of PERSON, the same school which produced reliever PERSON in NUMBER. Though he advanced to full-season ball the next year, and finished his second season in Double-A, PERSON struggled to further his climb through the Minors until NUMBER, when he put together an All-Star campaign in the ORGANIZATION and earned a promotion to Triple-A in July.PERSON's speed is his only plus tool, but he knows how to use it on the basepaths. He ranked fourth in the LOCATION in steals in NUMBER and then finished second the following year, swiping a combined NUMBER bags across the two seasons. The left-handed hitter offers little power but uses the entire field well and makes a lot of contact, though at times it can be weak or forced. PERSON is difficult to strike out for that same reason, and he'll draw his share of walks despite the aggressive approach.PERSON's wheels also aid him in center field, where he's an above-average defender with an average throwing arm. He profiles best as an extra outfielder, and he has seen time in the past at all three spots.",0
"PERSON made steady progress on the showcase circuit in NUMBER, and a strong start to last spring positioned him to become the first GPE high school pitcher drafted in the first round since PERSON in NUMBER.

NUMBER that they paid him $NUMBER.NUMBER million, the largest bonus in the second round.PERSON has the look of a power pitcher.

He usually pitches in the low NUMBERs with sink and has hit NUMBER mph, with the promise of more velocity as he gets stronger.His high-three-quarters arm slot helps PERSON stay on top of his tight curveball. His changeup and command are still in the early stages of their development, but it everything comes together he could be a frontline starter.",0
"PERSON has the stuff to be a starter. How much he can transition from being a thrower to a pitcher will determine if he can reach that ceiling.The GPE teenager can light up a radar gun, has plus action on his breaking ball and he has a workable changeup. The most consistent hard thrower in the system other than PERSON, PERSON could have a NUMBER fastball out of the bullpen, and his approach and style point to a life as a future reliever. He's starting to understand what it takes preparation and conditioning wise to be successful long-term, and he is realizing that there's more to his craft than just throwing hard.The PERSON will let PERSON start for now, try to get him innings and increase his pitchability in the hopes a starter can emerge, but a career as a setup man is more likely.",0
"GPE's career took off last season after he got glasses. He's a passable defensive catcher with great contact skills and modest power, which makes him a potential All Star.",0
"Another of the mid-round high school pitchers the ORGANIZATION paid over-slot bonuses in NUMBER, PERSON got the highest fifth-round bonus in the Draft at $NUMBER,NUMBER,NUMBER. The NUMBERth overall selection, he was the earliest Mississippi prep pitcher taken since the ORGANIZATION made PERSON a second-rounder in NUMBER.PERSON's stuff fluctuated wildly on the summer showcase circuit in NUMBER, but he solidified it as a high school senior and maintained it during his pro debut. He's capable of reaching back for NUMBER mph on his fastball, but he gets more life and is often more effective when he pitches at NUMBER-NUMBER mph.PERSON is adding more power to his curveball, which already featured good depth and could give him a second plus pitch. He has some fade to his changeup but sometimes tips it off by slowing his arm speed, a correctable flaw. He's athletic but lacks size and true command, so some scouts believe he'll wind up in the bullpen.",0
"PERSON was supposed to head to GPE, but had his roster spot and scholarship rescinded, so he walked on at GPE and started as a freshman when PERSON got hurt. This season, as a junior, he upped his offensive profile to his strong defensive game to land in the third round and get full pick value from the ORGANIZATION.There's no question about PERSON's defensive ability, with excellent catch and throw skills. His above-average arm plays up even more because of his quick release and accuracy. He moves well behind the plate and works very well with pitchers. An improved approach at the plate allowed PERSON to be GPE's best hitter in NUMBER, showing some extra-base ability from the right side of the plate.If PERSON can continue to show a more consistent bat, he has the chance to be a glove-first regular, something the ORGANIZATION clearly are hoping for. At worst, though, he should be a very solid backup at the big league level.",0
"One of the best all-around athletes to come out of GPE in years, PERSON entered the spring as a potential first-round pick. The Nigerian-born outfielder who moved to GPE when he was NUMBER months old had an uneven spring, enabling him to be available for the ORGANIZATION in the fourth round.PERSON is built like a linebacker at NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds, and all of his physical tools (raw power, speed, arm strength) grade out as plus. With his strength, bat speed and leverage, he can hit the ball farther than most high school players. Relatively new to baseball, PERSON lacks polish at times at the plate, on the bases and in the field. He has shown glimpses against good competition and has prototypical right-field tools, giving the ORGANIZATION yet another high-end athlete in their system.",0
"Just in case you thought the ORGANIZATION didn't have enough young outfielders in their system, there's PERSON, who has the chance to fit the right-field profile to a T if he can refine his approach at the plate.PERSON has always been young for his level and was added to the ORGANIZATION' NUMBER-man roster after a productive year in Double-A in NUMBER at age NUMBER. He has some bat speed and terrific raw power, with the ability to hit the ball out of any park, but he'll swing at just about everything. He has a cannon for an arm that has allowed him to rack up NUMBER outfield assists over the past two seasons. An average runner at best, he covers enough ground to play a solid right field defensively.While PERSON is running out of levels in the ORGANIZATION' system, the outfield youth and depth in the organization should afford him the time to work on his plate discipline so he can fully tap into his offensive tools.",0
"Despite tremendous arm strength and velocity, PERSON had an up-and-down career at ORGANIZATION. After the PERSON took him in the third round of the NUMBER Draft, he was a model of consistency during his pro debut, reaching full-season ball by the end of the season.PERSON has a plus fastball and a curveball that could be above-average as well. The right-hander will sit in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range, but can reach back for more, hitting the upper-NUMBERs at times. A lack of movement led to him getting hit in college, but he missed bats with his heater during his pro debut. PERSON can really spin his breaking ball and that served as a true out pitch for him in the Minors, throwing it more consistently than he did at ORGANIZATION. He struggled with his command throughout his college career, but only walked five in NUMBER pro innings.The PERSON thought about trying him out as a starter, but effort in his delivery, past command issues and the fact there are other starting candidates ahead of him means he's going to stick in the bullpen. He can get stretched out a bit in multi-inning outings as he tries to reach his ceiling as a setup man.",0
"PERSON passed on signing with the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER and instead opted to return for his senior season at ORGANIZATION, where he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and NUMBER saves to finish with the second-most saves (NUMBER) in program history. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their third-round pick in June, and he proved to be far more than just a money-saving senior discount during a stellar pro debut in which he reached full-season ball after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER below slot value.PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON because he's a lanky, side-armed right-hander with two above-average pitches. His combination of a low-NUMBERs fastball, that touches NUMBER mph, and a tight slider makes PERSON highly effective against same-sided hitters, and he's already impressed ORGANIZATION club officials with his ability to throw strikes from his unique slot.As a low-slot reliever who features both velocity and control, PERSON has the potential to jump on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION in his first full season.",0
"GPE is a potential elite defensive third baseman with some of the best lateral wuickness in the minors. He's a high-contact hitter without much current game power and little room on the body for more to come naturally, but he might just be a swing tweak away from being a five-tool guy.",0
"PERSON was a top-NUMBER lock before a back injury this spring that he also had earlier in his high school career. He hasn't gotten back on the mound yet, but  it's #NUMBER starter upside if everything works out.",0
"The ORGANIZATION emphasize athleticism when they look for catchers, so PERSON was an obvious target for them in the NUMBER Draft. He started at shortstop as a ORGANIZATION freshman before shifting behind the plate for his final two years before GPE selected him in the third round. After hitting NUMBER homers in his first two college seasons, he hit NUMBER in his third and then NUMBER in high Class A during his first full year as a pro.PERSON displayed some wiry strength but used more of a controlled approach at ORGANIZATION before turning his right-handed swing loose in pro ball. He aggressively looks to drive the ball now and does to all fields, though he'll need to make some adjustments after striking out at a NUMBER percent clip in NUMBER. He spent this offseason working to learn which bat path will give him the best production.PERSON has solid speed and is faster than most catchers, which will remain true even if he slows down due to the rigors of catching. He's agile and quick behind the plate, though he's still polishing his receiving and throwing because he's relatively new to the position. Extremely versatile, he spent time at second and third base last season.",0
"A premium athlete playing a premium position who performed well in the spring, GPE shot up ORGANIZATION boards and landed right in the middle of the first round. The FACILITY haven't hid from a reputation of liking athletic hitters and that's what they have in GPE. He has a ton of speed and should be a basestealing threat. The junior college product has shown an ability to make solid contact and putting the ball in play, flashing a little pull power in the process. The one thing that gave him trouble at times was the breaking ball and he'll have to learn to adjust to it as he moves up the ladder. The jury is still out about his ability to stay at shortstop, though the FACILITY sent him out for his pro debut as one.",0
"PERSON has shown some of the best stuff in the system ever since the ORGANIZATION made him the first pitcher they selected in the NUMBER Draft and signed him for an over-slot $NUMBER,NUMBER in the sixth round. But he saw his first two pro seasons end prematurely because of a recurring stress fracture in his elbow and also missed the first three weeks of the NUMBER season. PERSON shifted him to the bullpen in order to keep him healthy, and he not only stayed on the mound but also posted the best numbers of his career.PERSON had four legitimate pitches as a starter but focuses on two as a reliever. His upper-NUMBERs cutter is his bread and butter, and he plays it off a NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball that can hit NUMBER with some modest life. His downer curveball showed flashes of becoming a plus offering when he used it more in the past season, and his fading changeup had its moments as well.Working in shorter stints, PERSON demonstrates better control and command than he did as a starter. He has a strong, athletic frame and a sound delivery, so he should be durable, but the ORGANIZATION didn't have him pitch on consecutive days in NUMBER. He proved he could handle a heavier bullpen workload this year and made his big league debut in April.",1
Jennings tore his ORGANIZATION playing quarterback last fall but has been up to NUMBER this spring while pitching with a knee brace. He's also shown promising feel for two different breaking balls and some scouts think he'll have a plus slider at maturity. He is athletic and more physically projectable than many of the other prep arms in the draft.,0
"Scouting Grades: Fastball: NUMBER | Slider: NUMBER | Control: NUMBER | Overall: NUMBERA NUMBER fifth-round pick of the ORGANIZATION out of ORGANIZATION (Calif.) HS, PERSON turned down pro ball to attend PERSON. Three years later, he's one of the better two-way talents in the GPE. PERSON likely will get drafted as a first baseman, because his right-handed power is hard to ignore. He finished second in the ORGANIZATION home run derby last summer, and he went deep six times in NUMBER at-bats with wood on the GPE (including the all-star game and playoffs). He controls the strike zone well and could hit for a solid average to go with his pop, with almost all of his value as a position player coming from his bat. PERSON has power in his arm, too. As a reliever, he has worked at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his fastball and NUMBER-NUMBER mph with his slider, and saw time this spring as PERSON's closer.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the ORGANIZATION B of the NUMBER Draft, they knew the LOCATION product would likely end up in the bullpen. After a year-plus of letting him start to get innings and work on his stuff, the relief switch was flipped and PERSON took off, pitching his way to Double-A and earning a non-roster invite to big league Spring Training. And while he opened the NUMBER season in Triple-A, PERSON was up in the ORGANIZATION making his debut less than a week later. After the season, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON Roark.PERSON has always had elite-level power stuff and it really played up once he was pitching in shorter stints. Going right after hitters suits him, and his fastball-slider combination led to a ridiculous NUMBER.NUMBER K/NUMBER rate in NUMBER. His fastball registers in the NUMBER-NUMBER mph range out of the bullpen, and his hard slider is a big-time swing-and-miss pitch. His changeup will never be fantastic, but he does use it against left-handed hitters on occasion. The biggest thing holding PERSON back is his command. He's walked NUMBER.NUMBER per nine in his career, and issued NUMBER walks over seven innings in eight outings with the ORGANIZATION. He has closer stuff and the mentality to handle the job, but he'll need to find the strike zone a bit more consistently to get a chance to do it in the big leagues.",1
"PERSON led the LOCATION with nine homers and NUMBER walks as a Sacred Heart sophomore in NUMBER, intriguing scouts with his combination of pop and patience. But he didn't perform well in the ORGANIZATION and slumped as a junior, so he dropped to the NUMBERth round of the NUMBER Draft. He got going again offensively in his first full pro season, slamming NUMBER homers and finishing third in the Minors with NUMBER walks while reaching high Class A in NUMBER.While he's just NUMBER-foot-NUMBER and NUMBER pounds, PERSON has quick hands and makes repeated hard contact, giving him the ability to produce NUMBER-NUMBER homers on an annual basis. He's an extremely disciplined hitter who walked more than he struck out in his first two years as a pro, though his whiff rate has soared in Double-A this year and his on-base percentages have been much more impressive than his batting averages. He runs well and is aggressive on the bases.PERSON's athleticism, quickness and solid arm strength give him defensive versatility. The ORGANIZATION believe he's a legitimate shortstop and also have played him at third base and second base. There's no reason he couldn't handle some outfield duty as well, which could make for a very interesting utilityman package.",0
"The son of former big leaguer PERSON, and brother of ORGANIZATION farmhand PERSON, PERSON clearly has some serious baseball bloodlines. Like the others in his family, he does things in a less than conventional way, but he has had some success against good competition.Over the summer, PERSON showed the ability to square up quality pitching and his raw power was on display when he won the Under PERSON All-American Game Home Run Derby in GPE. This spring, he was still hitting the long ball, but also was getting tied up on mid-range fastballs inside. While he doesn't have the same exact leg kick setup as his father and brother, there are a lot of moving parts to his swing which concerns some scouts. He does have more bat speed than his brother did coming out of high school. A below-average runner, he's probably best suited for second base defensively, or perhaps left field.PERSON has been a bit of a polarizing prospect this spring, with some unsure his unorthodox setup will work at the next level. But the bloodlines and the power potential could still have the ORGANIZATION State commit off the board in the early stages of the GPE.",0
"Some international prospects burst onto the scene with wow-level tools. Others develop a little more gradually, needing time to mature and figure things out. PERSON, signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER in July NUMBER, fits into the latter category.While the ORGANIZATION are being patient with PERSON's development, he is already showing plenty of aptitude at shortstop. There's no question he can stay there long term, with smooth actions, good hands and a strong arm. PERSON is a fluid athlete, the type who can easily be mistaken for dogging it, but who just slows the game down defensively and makes it look easy. The switch-hitting teenager's offensive game will take more time. He has potential from both sides of the plate, but needs to add strength more than anything in order to impact the baseball. PERSON isn't likely to be a part of his game, but he could add enough good weight to find some extra-base ability.No one expects PERSON to burn through the ORGANIZATION' system, and he's likely to always be a glove-first middle infielder. A patient approach, however, could yield enough all-around skills so that PERSON could develop into a defensive-minded regular when all is said and done.",0
"GPE of a Mount Saint PERSON (GPE) program that has produced eight big leaguers, most notably PERSON, PERSON was GPE's best prep pitching prospect in NUMBER but slid to the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBERst round because of his strong commitment to PERSON. A breakout summer in the ORGANIZATION League two years later positioned him as a possible first-rounder for NUMBER before control woes as a junior dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the fourth. PERSON had him focus on improving his mechanics during his first year in pro ball and has been pleased with the initial results.PERSON has enough pitches to make it as a starter. He can maintain the velocity on his NUMBER-NUMBER mph fastball and both his hard curveball and slider can be plus pitches as well. He also can keep left-handers in check with a decent changeup that features some sink.After averaging NUMBER.NUMBER walks per nine innings during his college career, PERSON cut his walk rate to NUMBER.NUMBER during his first full year in pro ball. He pitched his way into the ORGANIZATION bullpen during his Draft year and many scouts pegged him as a reliever, but he may be able to stick in the rotation if he continues to throw strikes. If he did become a full-time reliever, he'd likely sit in the mid-NUMBERs with his fastball and add even more power to his breaking pitches.",0
"ORGANIZATION (Calif.) PERSON featured a pair of prospects who got paid in the later rounds of the NUMBER Draft: PERSON, who got $NUMBER,NUMBER from the ORGANIZATION in the sixth, and PERSON, who signed for $NUMBER,NUMBER with the ORGANIZATION in the NUMBERth. After playing mostly shortstop at ORGANIZATION and the middle infield in his pro debut, PERSON became a full-time catcher in NUMBER.PERSON has a chance to contribute both offensively and defensively, and he surged at the plate in the second half of NUMBER, batting .NUMBER/.NUMBER/.NUMBER with all NUMBER of his homers and prompting one club official to compare his sweet left-handed swing to that of PERSON. Though the results haven't been there in high Class A this year, PERSON has maintained a quality approach, patiently controlling the strike zone and focusing on using the center of the field. The ORGANIZATION still believe in his power and think he can hit NUMBER or more homers per season.For someone who shifted behind the plate full-time just two years ago, PERSON is an advanced defender. He has soft hands and moves well, though his receiving skills have slipped this year. PERSON also has solid arm strength, but he needs to improve the accuracy of his throws.",0
"PERSON played so well in his first professional Spring Training that the ORGANIZATION accelerated his time table and sent him to the ORGANIZATION to make his professional debut as a NUMBER-year-old in NUMBER. He's performed well in two years of GPE ball, despite being one of the youngest players in his league in both seasons.PERSON has a good left-handed swing with big raw power waiting for him to tap into in games. He's an aggressive hitter but generally does a good job of making hard contact and driving the ball to all fields. He's put on some weight since signing and is now a below-average runner, limiting him to left field. PERSON has the potential to be an offensive force and it'll be up to his bat to keep him moving toward the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON recovered from testicular cancer in high school to sign with GPE for $NUMBER,NUMBER as a NUMBERth-round pick in NUMBER. He has always hit when healthy -- but has had difficulty staying healthy, missing significant time every year from NUMBER-NUMBER with a concussion and thumb, wrist and hip injuries. He avoided the disabled list in NUMBER and homered in his first big league at-bat in August.PERSON has some of the best bat speed and feel for hitting among ORGANIZATION prospects. He manages his at-bats well, recognizing pitches and working counts while waiting for something he can drive. He keeps his right-handed swing under control, uses the entire field and can knock the ball out of any part of the park.Despite below-average speed, PERSON has a knack for stealing an occasional base and succeeded on NUMBER of NUMBER attempts (NUMBER percent) in his first seven seasons. He has a solid arm and gets the job done defensively at first base and both outfield corners. PERSON to compete for GPE's first-base job this spring, he broke the navicular bone in his left foot when he fouled a ball off it in mid-February.",1
"PERSON was headed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE before the ORGANIZATION picked him in the fourth round of the NUMBER Draft. He broke out three years later, earning midseason All-Star honors in the Class A Advanced PERSON before finishing second in the circuit in doubles (NUMBER) and tying for fourth in hits (NUMBER). While he struggled the following year in Double-A and then missed time due to injury in his return to the level, a fully healthy PERSON rebounded in NUMBER to earn his first Triple-A promotion after a red-hot start. PERSON is a disciplined hitter with a quick swing and a knack for putting the barrel on the ball. Though he's physically strong and shows good raw power during batting practice, his line-drive bat path and whole-field approach continues to produce more doubles than home runs during games. PERSON gets out of the box well for a right-handed hitter and shows average speed when he gets going.Drafted as an infielder, PERSON moved to the outfield upon turning pro and has spent the bulk of his time in left, where both his fringy range and arm strength are clean fits. The ORGANIZATION believe he'll eventually tap into his power, which is his key to carving out a bench role at the highest level.",1
"The ORGANIZATION saw PERSON as an advanced college hitter when they drafted him in NUMBER. He lived up to his billing, spending his second full professional season in Double-A before being dealt to the ORGANIZATION in November NUMBER. He missed most of his first year in the ORGANIZATION organization after undergoing surgery on his left foot in April before returning to action in the second half. PERSON has a balanced swing and barrels up the ball well. He's at his best when he's hitting line drives to all fields, but his swing has some loft to it, giving him some pop. After beginning his professional career as a first baseman, PERSON has exclusively played right field in the past two seasons. He's a capable defender there, but it'll be up to his bat to get him to the ORGANIZATION.",0

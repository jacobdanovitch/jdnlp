There's some debate as to which is better, his low-80s slider or his tumbling changeup, but both should be at least average offerings.PERSON has three pitches and fills the strike zone, so he'll definitely be a starter going forward.

{"label":0,"text":"Even those casually exposed to public facing prospect analysis become familiar with a few key concepts and player archetypes, and an early lesson often addresses the volatility of players like PERSON, who have several elite tools that will lead to star-level performance if they hit enough, but who also carry significant risk that they will strike out too much to matter at all. Of course, the reason each individual player has strikeout issues can vary. Some hitters have feckless, over-aggressive approaches, while others can't recognize breaking balls or have a problem with lever length and get tied up inside. PERSON's issues -- his strikeout rate has fallen between 27% and 32% each of the last three years -- appear to stem from his bat path and limited bat control. Stiff wrists cause his bat head to drag into the zone, which can cause him to be tardy on fastballs at the letters and, more frequently, flail at soft stuff dipping down and away from him. PERSON has similar issues that have yet to be remedied. \nPERSON does enough other stuff that, even if the strike outs remain an issue, he could still be a valuable big leaguer. He crushes anything down and in, has sufficient plate coverage to hit fastballs middle away, and has enough power to do damage to the opposite field. He also has good ball\/strike recognition so, again like PERSON, there should be power, walks, and up-the-middle defense. We think PERSON is likely to be an exciting but flawed everyday player, though it's not audacious to think his relative youth (he was a 20-year-old at Hi-A in 2018) and inexperience (he also missed a year of reps due to a suspension for bad paperwork) leave more room for growth than we anticipate."}

He'll likely grow into average raw power, but below-average game power due to a more gap-to-gap approach.

He often fought his delivery, causing his stuff to not be as sharp. That was particularly true of his breaking ball, which can get caught between a curve and a slider. He needs to rely on movement, deception and command because of his lack of plus stuff, starting with an 87-94 mph fastball that can sneak up on hitters due to his deception, but often lacks movement. He might need to pick one breaking ball to help define it better and give him a third solid pitch, behind his above-average changeup.

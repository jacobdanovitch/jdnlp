His defense was baptized by fire in the ORGANIZATION as PERSON had to catch guys with huge stuff like PERSON and PERSON, among others. If his offensive ability can withstand the developmental burdens and physical grind of catching, he could be a middle-of-the-order bat, too. Even if PERSON's in-game power manifests itself as doubles, he profiles at catcher and GPE's recent, brief experimentation with PERSON at third base provides some precedent for what may happen should PERSON prove unable to catch or if GPE thinks moving him will get his bat to the majors more quickly.","label":0}

He has an advanced approach at the plate and projects to be able to hit for average and power as he physically matures. He has well above-average speed and covers a lot of ground in the outfield. His strong arm will help him man a corner outfield position if he loses a step as he gets older, but he has a good chance to remain in center.

He led the Triple-A PERSON in slugging (.590) and ORGANIZATION (.989) last year but struggled in his introduction to the big leagues.Though he has an unorthodox left-handed stroke, PERSON makes it work with exceptional hand-eye coordination and plenty of bat speed. He recognizes pitches well and is rarely fooled, producing consistent hard contact to all fields. He manages the strike zone well and has successfully incorporated more launch angle into his swing since entering pro ball, giving him the potential to hit for high averages with 25 or more homers per season.If there's a knock on PERSON it's that while he has continued to progress as an offensive force, he has regressed in other areas. He has average speed but doesn't always show it. He spent much of his first four years as a pro in center field, but his lack of instincts and quality route-running worked against him there. He spent more time in 2018 in right field, where he has a solid arm and can be an average defender if he continues to work at it.","label":1}

He had an understandably uneven pro debut after a lengthy college season but was able to make developmental strides in his full-season debut, finishing the year in the Class A Advanced PERSON. Unfortunately for GPE, that success hasn't followed him with the move up to Double-A in 2017.A tall, athletic right-hander, GPE uses his height to create a favorable plane toward the plate, and he did a better job of repeating his delivery in 2016 after the ORGANIZATION toned down his leg kick. He sits in the low 90s and can reach back for more with his fastball, throwing the pitch with sinking action and late, arm-side life. His lanky frame leaves room to add some strength, and some scouts believe he'll continue to add velocity as he develops physically. His power slider plays more like a cutter, thrown in the upper-80s with good tilt, and both his curveball and changeup have average potential. He throws strikes with his entire arsenal and can pitch to both sides of the plate with his heater, although GPE' overall control and command require further refinement.GPE wore down physically during his professional debut but showed better durability and stamina in 2016 after he added strength during the offseason. He lacks a plus offering but mixes his pitches well, giving GPE a higher floor than ceiling.

When he did get the chance in GPE, however, he really struggled to find the strike zone. His command in the ORGANIZATION regressed a bit as well, but he didn't get hit en route to finishing second in the organization in ORGANIZATION. An elbow injury kept him from making any progress in 2019.Outside of an inflated walk rate in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON wasn't hittable and posted low ORGANIZATIONs in both Double-A and Triple-A when healthy, using his typical feel for pitching and deception to allow his largely average stuff play up. His fastball will sit in the low 90s, though he can reach back for more on occasion, and he throws it with good life. His sinking changeup is his best pitch, a plus offspeed offering that he keeps down in the zone. He mixes in his average curveball effectively.The ORGANIZATION hope the adversity PERSON faced in his brief big league stint will help him move forward in the long run.

The drop in his ground ball rate since coming over from ORGANIZATION -- 38% with GPE, after close to 50% with the ORGANIZATION -- seems to corroborate the visual evidence of tweaks, so there's a chance PERSON' 2018 was just the product of developmental growing pains. \nEven at 21, PERSON remains physically projectable and is likely to add more and more mass and strength to his giant frame as he enters his mid-20s. The lift and rotation in his swing appear suited for power production that might arrive in games when new muscle arrives on the body. PERSON doesn't track pitches well and he often appears imbalanced at the plate. We have him projected as a strikeout-prone third baseman who sells out for big power. He'll need to improve a bit on defense to stay on the infield, but it's unreasonable to expect most athletes this size to have total control of their bodies at this age anyway, so there's cause for optimism on that end. \nWe're still on PERSON despite a bad 2018, and think he has some dormant thump that will make him relevant eventually.","label":0}
{"text":"The amateur side of scouting considered PERSON to be perhaps the most advanced high school hitter in the 2015 draft. PERSON to 2018 and PERSON is a career .238 hitter. The low batting averages he has posted have been due less to his inability to put the bat on the ball and more to an approach that is passive in excess. PERSON watches a lot of driveable pitches go by. That approach is also part of why he's never run a season walk rate beneath 14%, and PERSON's ability to reach base is part of why he's still such an interesting prospect. There has also been an approach change here, one that may have impacted his plate coverage. In two years, he has transitioned from an all-fields doubles doubles approach to a pull-oriented hitter. In the 2018 Fall League he was fouling off pitches that he used to slice for doubles the opposite way. Still only 22, PERSON has physical talent (he once projected, for us, as an average regular) that may resurface with some approach changes, but this current iteration probably isn't a big leaguer.","label":1}

Able to throw up to 97 mph, he can also keep hitters guessing by changing arm angles and tempo or shortening his stride. Unless he develops his below-average and seldom-used changeup, he could have time managing left-handed hitters in the big leagues. He could temper that with by burying a backdoor slider in on lefties.While he certainly has the mentality to be a big-league closer with a delivery not unlike PERSON or PERSON, his stuff projects as a likely better fit as a middle reliever or right-handed matchup specialist.

We were all-in despite scout concerns about his lack of range in the outfield and fear that he might just be a DH. The gap between where we had PERSON on our pre-draft board (12) and where he went (20) was large enough that we wondered if we were too high. Then PERSON hit .303\/.390\/.500 in pro ball during the rest of the summer, and we could sleep again. He has huge raw power and doesn't swing with violence or effort to generate it; it's just there.

PERSON healthy in 2017, PERSON got back on track at ORGANIZATION to earn his first Major League callup in September. PERSON might be undersized at 5-foot-11, but he's loaded with arm strength. Working out of the bullpen exclusively, PERSON operates with a 95-98 mph fastball and pairs it with a plus slider in the mid- to upper-80s.

Injuries plagued him again in 2017, as hamate bone surgery forced him out of action in June.Some of the regression is really a matter of comparison to his huge season in PERSON in 2015, where he hit .300 and slugged close to .500. It's possible he may not be the offensive force some thought was emerging, but the ORGANIZATION still feel there's enough bat here for him to be a legitimate prospect. Excited by his extra-base output in the GPE, it's possible there won't be much power moving forward. There are no questions about his defense, however, with the hands, arm and range to stay at shortstop long-term, making him the best defensive shortstop in the system.Just 21, PERSON is plenty young enough to shrug off these setbacks and rediscover his solid approach.

Late in 2018, he was touching 96 and flashing a plus changeup and curveball. A mammoth 6-foot-6, it's possible PERSON's command will come later as he gains control of his limbs.

That's getting on base and causing damage with his plus speed. That speed works in the outfield as well, where he covers a lot of ground and plays an above-average center field.PERSON might profile best as a fourth outfielder type, one who can play good defense at all three spots and impact the game with his speed.

It ended prematurely when he injured his hand in late April, but he still showed enough to earn PERSON consideration as early as the fifth or sixth round.While PERSON doesn't have a true carrying tool, he does a little bit of everything and offers versatility, as well. He'll be more of a second baseman than a shortstop at the upper levels of pro ball, and he could become a super utilityman also capable of playing on the outfield corners.PERSON has more strength and bat speed than most middle infielders, and his ability to barrel balls should translate into decent batting averages with gap power.

His above-average arm plays up even more because of his quick release and accuracy. He moves well behind the plate and works very well with pitchers. An improved approach at the plate allowed PERSON to be GPE's best hitter in 2017, showing some extra-base ability from the right side of the plate.If PERSON can continue to show a more consistent bat, he has the chance to be a glove-first regular, something the ORGANIZATION clearly are hoping for.

Two years later, as a Draft-eligible sophomore, ORGANIZATION's stock was on the rise as a consistent college hitter after missing most of his freshman season with injury.ORGANIZATION's offensive profile stands out the most. The 6-foot-3 infielder has the chance to hit at the next level with a knack for barreling up the baseball that's been on display all spring. He's added strength to his wiry frame, and he's showing more ability to drive the ball, with the chance for future average power. A good athlete and plus runner, ORGANIZATION can steal a base as well. The jury is out whether he can stick at shortstop in the long-term. Some see a move to second base, but those who think his actions and hands are what's holding him back think he'd be best off in center field, where his athleticism would play well.

If he doesn't have 80 raw power now, he will in the next few years, and he's actually an average runner underway, though his first step isn't great and he'll lose a step or two with maturity. PERSON has the arm to profile in right field, but down the road, he'll likely be an average glove there at best. There's obvious leverage to his swing and he hit 10 homers in 44 games in the ORGANIZATION as a 17-year-old, so it's not like he's sushi raw at tapping into his best tool. PERSON had similar tools at this stage, so that's one way this can go. Another would be former Tigers prospect PERSON, who played last year in GPE.

He had a spectacular season after changing organizations, ranking second in the Minors in GPE (1.79) and third in GPE (0.91) while rising from PERSON to Triple-A, but has yet to pitch in 2019 after getting diagnosed with a stress reaction in his elbow in GPE, but missed the first three months of the 2019 season after getting diagnosed with a stress reaction in his elbow in GPE.King's success centers on precision command of a two-seam fastball that sits at 92-95 mph. He can run or sink his heater to either corner of the plate, and he's an extreme ground-ball pitcher with a career groundout\/airout ratio of 1.7 through his first three pro seasons. The ORGANIZATION also helped him improve his secondary pitches, leading to a jump in his strikeout rate from 6.3 per nine innings in two years in GPE's system to 8.5 in his first in GPE York's.Both King's slider and changeup can be solid pitches when they're working, and evaluators generally prefer his slider by a slight margin. He has the best control and command among ORGANIZATION pitching prospects and one of the highest floors as well. Regarded as a finesse right-hander who might fit at the back of a rotation at the time of his trade, he now he appears to be more than that.","label":0}
{"text":"He's quite little, but GPE is an athletic backstop with catch and throw skills, as well as advanced feel for contact. He's twitchy and mobile, which bodes well for his ball-blocking future, and he's a fine receiver and pitch framer already, though he hasn't caught a lot of big league-quality stuff yet. It's possible the physical grind of catching will take an outsized toll on GPE's little body and he won't hit enough to be anything, but on tools, at the very least, he looks like a good backup catching prospect.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON was a solid middle-round college pitching prospect going into the 2018 draft, with most clubs treating him as a 6th-8th round talent who could possibly be a target for the 11th-12th rounds and a $125,000 bonus, as cheap senior signs fill-in the latter stages of the top 10 rounds. Then PERSON (Dominican-born and whose name is pronounced like the GPE country) had one of the latest pre-draft velo spikes possible, suddenly hitting 95 mph during the ORGANIZATION conference tournament in his final college game just two weeks before the draft. PERSON is a dime a dozen these days, but PERSON had the athleticism and arm action of a starter and had put on about 15 pounds in the previous 12 months, so some thought this could be coming. PERSON who had scouts at that start shot him up the board, and the ORGANIZATION jumped to the front of the line to take him in the fourth round. The velo spike held in pro ball: PERSON sat 92-95 and hit 97 mph in fall instructional league and put on about 10 additional pounds after signing. The upside is a bit limited, as his slider and changeup still just flash average at best, but the ORGANIZATION are changing PERSON's slurvy college breaking ball into more of a true slider and pushing him to throw his changeup more, so it wouldn't be shocking to see the future pitch grades move north as he continues to mature as a pitcher.","label":0}
{"text":"After demolishing the ORGANIZATION (as was expected), PERSON had a solid 38 game run at Double-A. He turned 21 in GPE. He's hit everywhere he's been since high school and continues to look fine, if unspectacular, at shortstop. He's above-average in every way at the plate (the bat control, power, feel for opposite field contact, ability to punish mistakes) which means he's got a good chance to be an All Star if he stays at shortstop, and it looks like he's going to.","label":1}
{"text":"The ORGANIZATION have never shied away from trying to draft and develop high-ceilinged pitchers, so it was no surprise they took PERSON from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks. They went slightly over pick value to lure him away from GPE Carolina.PERSON has a terrific pitcher's build at 6-foot-3 and 205 pounds. As a onetime shortstop prospect, he's athletic as well. PERSON delivers 90-95 mph fastballs with good life and an easy delivery, making his heater appear to jump on hitters at the plate. He also adds some power to a curveball that could be a plus pitch in the future, and he shows some aptitude for throwing a changeup as well. PERSON erased concerns about his health this spring after he had biceps tendinitis during the summer showcase season in 2013. There's some upside here, though it may take some time for PERSON to reach it.","label":0}
{"text":"Like his older brother, ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON can really swing the bat. He has a short, compact swing and a ton of bat speed. The ball jumps off his bat, and he has the chance to hit for both average and plenty of power.While PERSON has good hands and a solid arm, most feel he won't stay at shortstop but has all the tools to profile very well at the hot corner, the same position his big pro plays. Whether he heads to college like ORGANIZATION -- he's committed to PERSON -- remains to be seen, but his name was generating some buzz as the spring wore on.","label":1}
{"text":"Since moving to the bullpen in July of 2018, PERSON has struck out more than a batter per inning in what are almost always multi-inning appearances. After a dominant month at Hi-A to start 2019, the ORGANIZATION moved PERSON to Double-A and atrted to vary his workload, and first asked hiim to throw on back-to-back nights at the end of July. He's being groomed for a relief role, one that will likely be fastball-heavy. His fastball has life at the top of the zone and PERSON really hides the ball well, so he's able to slip it past hitters at the letters. His secondary stuff is average on pure stuff but plays well off his heater. He profiles as a middle reliever.","label":0}
{"text":" PERSON took a long road to the ORGANIZATION after the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 18th round in 2007. He was traded, claimed on waivers and underwent PERSON surgery. But when he finally arrived in September, it was worth the wait. After just nine regular season appearances, he made the ORGANIZATION playoff roster and helped them to their third World Series title in five years. PERSON's ascension can be traced to his powerful fastball. He has added velocity in recent years, and his fastball now sits in the upper 90s and touches 100 mph. He pairs it with a sharp slider that has become a swing-and-miss pitch. He also mixes in a changeup. After dominating PERSON hitters, PERSON showed some weaknesses during the postseason. In eight appearances, he gave up six home runs -- five to left-handed hitters. He'll need to improve those numbers to become a reliable late-innings option for the ORGANIZATION.","label":0}
{"text":"The ORGANIZATION used both of their first-round picks on up-the-middle preps in 2013, selecting PERSON with the ninth-overall pick and then nabbing ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 14, targeting the GPE state product for his revered defensive prowess. He reached Double-A for the first time in 2016, the same year that he was dealt with PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION. Sidelined with a left oblique injury for much of the first half in 2017, ORGANIZATION performed well back in Double-A after making a healthy return in July and then made up for lost time in the ORGANIZATION Winter League during the offseason.ORGANIZATION's defense has long been his calling card, and there's little doubt that it will get him to the big leagues. An excellent blocker and receiver who garners high praise for his game-calling and his ability to handle a staff, ORGANIZATION also is adept at controlling the running game with his plus arm and efficient pop technique. At the plate, ORGANIZATION continues to show natural hitting ability with a level, line-drive producing swing and advanced feel for the zone, and he even showed an uptick in power in 2017, connecting on a career-high six home runs with Double-A New Hampshire despite playing in just 34 games. ORGANIZATION's stock as a hitter seemingly is on the rise now that he's healthy. His glove, meanwhile, is good enough for him to carve out a role as defensive-minded backup, if not a regular in the big leagues.","label":1}
{"text":"A growth spurt bouyed PERSON's tools and draft stock, as he's this year's most prominent pop-up high school prospect. He may have the best frame in the entire draft but has already grown into considerable power, which he gets to in games despite an awkwardly-timed stride. At times clumsy on defense, PERSON may still be growing into his new body. He may end up at second or third base (where he played as an amateur) or get a try in center field if his hands and actions don't improve. He's one of the draft's higher risk, higher reward prospects.","label":0}
{"text":"It's never easy to find true power bats, but scouts who ventured to the ORGANIZATION this spring may think they have found one in PERSON. They'll have to really buy that his power will play because that is clearly PERSON' carrying tool.Big and strong, PERSON can absolutely put on a show in batting practice, showing legitimate over-the-fence ability. There is more strength in his left-handed swing than bat speed, making some wonder how he'll do as he hits against better pitching more consistently. While he's played outfield for his high school team, most feel his below-average speed will limit him to first base, where the onus will really be on the GPE commit's bat to produce.A team taking PERSON in the top five rounds will be a believer in that bat, that the power is legit and he'll make enough contact to tap into it. He could be a power-hitting run producer, albeit without a high average, like a ORGANIZATION or, if it really clicks, PERSON.","label":0}
{"text":"There are college catchers who can really hit, but might have to move out from behind the plate because of their defensive inefficiencies. Then there are those like PERSON, who undoubtedly have a future as a defensive backstop, with how much they hit truly determining what kind of professional career they have.A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON's glove also earned him a spot on ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION. He has excellent hands and moves well behind the plate, allowing him to receive and block well. He has a strong and accurate arm, recording excellent pop times to second base on a consistent basis. Offensively, the right-handed hitter has been less productive. He does make consistent contact and rarely strikes out with decent on-base skills. And he's having his best offensive season now, albeit without any power.PERSON more than likely profiles as a backup at the next level. If his bat comes around with pro instruction, he could become a defensive-minded regular. In either case, his defensive skillset should have him off the board in the top six rounds.","label":0}
{"text":"A draft eligible sophomore whose frame remains projectable, PERSON will run his fastball up to 97 but he lacks a clear bat-missing secondary. Some scouts project heavily on his cutter\/slider and curveball because we are talking about a sophomore and one who spent much of his freshman year in the ORGANIZATION bullpen where his reps were limited.","label":0}
{"text":"A.J. PERSON might be the more \"famous\" ORGANIZATION of GPE starter, but it's been PERSON who has been the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter for all three years of his college career. He's more about pitchability than stuff, but that's led to a ton of success in the ultra-competitive SEC.Strong and durable, PERSON is a strike-throwing machine with a potential three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise, but it plays up because of his command. His best pitch is his changeup, which he locates and sinks extremely well. Even when hitters know it's coming, he still gets outs. PERSON's breaking ball is slurvy and a bit inconsistent. When it's on, it can be virtually unhittable and has the potential of being a third Major League average offering.The lack of an explosive fastball limits his ceiling and, as a result, his ORGANIZATION stock. There's no question PERSON is the first Gator pitcher to go off the board and some others could pass PERSON by because of the fastball, but whatever team takes PERSON will be getting a college performer who should be quick to the big leagues as a back-end starter.","label":0}
{"text":"Fortes was a high-profile prep catcher who has plateaued tools-wise since showcase season three years ago, but has made strides in the craft of catching. His arm is a 45 that can occasionally play at a 50 when his release is quick, but he shows solid average receiving skills to go with above average makeup. At the plate, there's some raw power, but it's more of a contact-oriented, line drive approach, helping Fortes profile as a high probability backup who could be a low-end starter if anything outperforms expectations.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON has been effective throughout his career at LOCATION, first as a freshman reliever in 2012, then as the team's Saturday starter in 2013. As ORGANIZATION's Friday starter this year, he started to pour it on and boost his ORGANIZATION stock as the spring progressed.With a big, strong, durable frame, PERSON looks well built to eat up a lot of innings in the future. He's added velocity and touches the mid 90s somewhat consistently with a fastball that also features a good amount of sink. His hard curve has the chance to be an out pitch, and he shows good deception and sink with his changeup at times as well. He gets praise for his mound presence, though he does need to improve his control in the future.PERSON isn't among the first college arms that will be called during the ORGANIZATION's early rounds, but the strong right-hander has the chance to be a nice find in the next tier of advanced arms.","label":0}
{"text":"A strong junior season that wiped out a rough sophomore campaign at PERSON vaulted PERSON into early round talk prior to the 2017 Draft. He landed early in the second round and got a touch over $1.8 million, a slight shade below pick value, to sign. He went out and had a very solid debut playing center field for PERSON in the rookie-level PERSON League.The Reds were pleasantly surprised with how good PERSON's approach was during his debut. There was an expectation of more swing and miss than there was; instead he struck out just 15 percent of the time while drawing a fair amount of walks, with it looking like he should carry a Major League average hit tool with him. PERSON hit 17 homers in his junior year, but PERSON is a very good place to hit for power, so it remains to be seen if those numbers will transfer to the pro game. A plus runner, PERSON can steal a base and he had better reads in center field than he did in college.If his pro debut is any indication, PERSON could start moving a little faster and develop into a big league regular in center, perhaps a No. 2 type hitter. If the power shows up, he could have a bigger impact than anticipated.","label":0}
{"text":"The summer before his senior year of high school, PERSON looked like a relatively unprojectable pitchability lefty, albeit an advanced one. His fastball was only in the 88-92 range at ORGANIZATION, though his changeup and curveball were each above-average. He did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out. The following spring, with a new physique, PERSON's stuff was way up across the board, his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, touching 97. Four starts into his senior season, PERSON tore his ORGANIZATION and need PERSON. \nAfter most of the first three rounds of the 2016 draft had come and gone it seemed as though PERSON might end up at the ORGANIZATION of GPE. Four outings (including the one during which he broke) was not enough time for many teams to have high-level decision makers in to see him and take him early, but the ORGANIZATION (who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury) called his name and signed him for $1.4 million, a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder. PERSON rehabbed as a ORGANIZATION and continued to strengthen his body. When he returned the following summer, his stuff had completely returned. He made just three starts for the ORGANIZATION before he was traded to GPE as part of the LOCATION Doolittle\/Ryan PERSON deal. \nHe has quickly climbed GPE's minor league ladder and reached Triple-A at age 20 in 2018. Those crafty pitchability traits from high school are still extant. PERSON will vary the shape of his breaking ball -- he can throw it for strikes to get ahead of hitters, he back foot it to righties -- and he uses his changeup against lefties and righties. His delivery is a bit violent but it doesn't inhibit his command, and PERSON's musculature seems better able to deal with the effort than it was when he was in high school. His fastball, which has been up to 97 in his big league appearances this spring, may not play like a mid-90s heater because he is undersized and a short-strider, but he locates it well enough to avoid getting hurt. \nHe has mid-rotation upside and is abnormally polished. We may see him in GPE this year.","label":0}

He has a fastball that reaches up to 93-94 mph, and he has a good curveball to go along with it. PERSON also throws a slider, which isn't as good as his other breaking ball, and he shows a really good feel for a changeup. The one thing of concern is that PERSON put on a lot of weight, and it is not the good kind. It's clear he's going to have to work hard on his conditioning to continue his progress.PERSON is only 17 years old.

Committed to GPE, he'll be Draft-eligible as a 21-year-old sophomore in 2020 in the unlikely event he makes it to college rather than turning pro.Compared to a more athletic version of PERSON, PERSON stands out most for his hitting ability. He has tremendous feel for the barrel and repeatedly demonstrates a professional approach from the left side of the plate. With his solid raw power and speed, he can contribute offensively in a variety of ways.Scouts aren't sold that PERSON can stay in center field all the way up to the big leagues, but his quickness and instincts give him a chance.

He struggled again at the plate in 2018, batting .232\/.340\/.399 between Double-A and Triple-A, but still has more offensive upside than most middle infielders.PERSON's best attribute is his plus raw power, with his bat speed and the strength in his compact frame translating into hard-hit balls to all fields. He can get aggressive at times but his hand-eye coordination and patience should have translated into better than a .254 career average in his first five pro seasons. He did make some adjustments last year to reduce the uppercut in his left-handed stroke but they didn't produce noticeably better results.PERSON needs to reach his offensive potential to make it as a big league regular because he doesn't stand out in other aspects of the game. While he has good instincts on the bases, his average speed doesn't make him much of a threat to steal. Signed as a shortstop, he gets the job done at second base but his average arm limits his usefulness on the left side of the infield.","label":1}

PERSON had the best pure stuff of the group and became the second ORGANIZATION hurler to come off the board when the ORGANIZATION took him in the fourth round. After signing for $437,500, PERSON had a dominant pro debut in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League, where he posted a 47\/5 K\/BB ratio in 32 innings and paced the circuit's relievers with 13.1 strikeouts per nine innings. He was expected to move quickly during his first full pro campaign in 2016 before right arm tenderness forced him to the disabled list in late April.PERSON's delivery involves considerable effort and is far from aesthetically pleasing, but it doesn't impede his ability to control two plus pitches. The right-hander's heater sits in the mid 90s and reaches 98 mph, and he did a better job locating it down in the zone during his pro debut. PERSON's slider, meanwhile, is equally impressive, and scouts considered it to be one of the better breaking balls in the 2015 Draft class. It's a true out pitch, thrown with power at 84-87 mph as well as tight spin that gives hit late biting action.PERSON's delivery and heavy slider use leads to concerns about his long-term health, but he's shown steady improvement since his sophomore year at ORGANIZATION, with his stuff continuing to trend in the right direction.

He hasn't disappointed, making his way to Double-A in his first full season, then up to Triple-A in Year 2 while finishing among the system leaders in ORGANIZATION, strkeouts and wins two seasons in a row.PERSON does everything well on the mound, but nothing elite that jumps off the page. He has a four-pitch arsenal that he fills the strike zone with aggressively. He's not a huge strikeout guy, though he has an 8.1 K\/9 ratio in his career heading into 2018, nor does he get a ton of groundball outs. What he does successfully is keep hitters from barreling up the baseball consistently. His fastball typically sits in the low 90s and his slider is his go-to pitch, though he'll flip in a slower 12-to-6 curveball for strike one on occasion and has an average changeup as well.PERSON's ceiling may be that of a back-end starter, but he's not too far away from reaching it. His ability to sequence his pitches and elicit poor contact will be key for him to get PERSON hitters out.","label":0}

During that fall and winter, though, PERSON began to reshape his physique. He dropped about 50 pounds and came out the following spring with much better stuff, his fastball creeping into the 93-95 range and touching 97. \nPERSON and his stuff have continued to improve, though he had a somewhat chaotic 2018. He missed the season's first 50 games due to a suspension for the use of an unknown stimulant, then had his season debut pushed back due to a lat strain. He finally toed the rubber at ORGANIZATION in June and made five four-inning starts before he was removed in the first inning of his sixth outing and placed on the ORGANIZATION with an oblique strain. He missed a little over a month, then made two more starts in August before feeling lat discomfort warming up for what would have been a third. He was shut down as a precaution and sent to the ORGANIZATION to pick up innings. \nHis stuff was wholly intact in GPE, as PERSON sat 93-97 and touched 99. His apparitional changeup haunts both left and right-handed hitters, disappearing beneath barrels as it approaches the plate. PERSON's array of breaking stuff is well-designed. His power 12-6 curveball honors his GPE heritage but has been de-emphasized as an out pitch in deference to his tilting, mid-80s slider. He has the best collection of stuff in the minor leagues, and might have been in the big leagues last year if not for various setbacks.

PERSON's delivery is pretty rough and features quite a bit of violence about his head. This, along with his lengthy injury history, has created worries about his health, and hinders his ability to locate with precision, as he throws strikes but not always where he wants to. Perception about PERSON's health may drive GPE to move him quickly so he can reach the majors before he breaks again. His stuff appeared close to ready last year, as he worked in the mid-90s with armside movement that pairs well with his power, and a mid-80s changeup, while his lower arm slot enables his slider to play against righties. He started last year but we like him as a three-pitch middle relief prospect.","label":0}

He took a softer 6-foot-6, 270 body and got in better shape for the spring, and it took a high effort relief type into a possible workhorse mid-rotation starter. PERSON still stands out for his fastball\/slider combo and the changeup and command are around average, so it may be more of a power multi-inning arm than a true 200-inning starter, but his two best features are also ORGANIZATION friendly. This means that progressive clubs see a quick-moving arm with PERSON McCullers-type qualities, and traditional ones see someone they could mold into a power starter.","label":0}

His left-handed swing presently is geared more to line drives, but his size and strength create plenty of raw power that's more obvious during batting practice than in games.

Since then, he has developed into one of the hardest throwers and most intriguing arms in the system.PERSON's fastball jumped from 90-93 mph in 2015 to 94-97 mph last year. He topped out at 99 mph and has more velocity to come once he adds strength to his lanky 6-foot-8 frame. His size and long arms create unusual angle and plane, making it even harder to catch up to his heater.PERSON's curveball and changeup both show the potential to become at least solid offerings, with the latter more consistent because his long arm action sometimes prevents him from staying on top of his breaking ball. Considering his size and youth, he does a decent job of repeating his delivery and throwing strikes, but he still has a ways to go.

He's patient, uses the entire field and makes consistent hard contact. He has the bat speed and strength to generate average power, but his right-handed swing is fairly flat and produced just two homers (albeit with 40 doubles) in 2016.After splitting time between first base and the outfield during his first three pro seasons, GPE has primarily played first base since 2016.

PERSON flashed plus speed, a plus arm, and plus raw power from the left side, projecting as the rare big center fielder with hit and power tools. The concern was that PERSON's uphill, aggressive, power-oriented cut would limit his contact rate; after the ORGANIZATION took him in the first round, his swing plane was flatter.

He unlocked his power in 2014, more than doubling his home run total from the year prior, while earning a promotion from Double- to Triple-A before getting that first big league callup. The 2013 PERSON is a capable defender at first, but his below-average speed limits him to that position only.

He sat at 92-95 mph and reached 97 with his fastball and had a low-80s slider with hard bite when he stayed on top of his breaking pitch. But his velocity was way down in his first full season, so the ORGANIZATION shut him down after two innings in GPE ball.PERSON rarely needed a changeup as an amateur and will need to develop one to remain a starter.

He is fearless on the mound and looks like he should have a solid three-pitch mix to attack hitters with. He typically pitches with a 60 fastball, up to 95 mph, but it plays up at times because of the power sink to it that leads to a ton of ground-ball outs. His slider got slurvish at times last year and sometimes will look more like a curveball, but he's shown enough feel to spin a tighter slider and there is confidence that it will be an average, if not better, breaking ball.

We first heard his name when he was wowing pro scouts who saw him in GPE last summer. The first scout we spoke with said ORGANIZATION had a ORGANIZATION starter kit, flashing two plus pitches and a starter's delivery, though the changeup and command were understandably a bit behind. Those things progressed throughout the summer and he got a taste of Low-A at the end of the year. ORGANIZATION officials love ORGANIZATION' makeup and competitive fire, and think he's got a chance to be the 200-inning starter who comes out of this system, as the other pitchers on the list have one or more of the typical concerns (durability, command, arm surgery, less experience, or a standout pitch that fits best in relief).

To stay there, he'll need to improve his control and command while refining his secondary offerings.","label":0}

He clocked a 6.21-second 60-yard dash at a Prospect Development Pipeline event last June and wreaked havoc on the bases at the LOCATION Pro showcase in GPE. He has almost no history against quality pitching and faces weak prep competition, so scouts aren't sure what to make of his bat, but he has enough promise that he could go as early as the third round.Unlike PERSON, PERSON shows the potential to make some impact at the plate.

His frame is already very physical and has less room for mass than most teen prospects and though he's an above-average runner who will get early-career reps in center field, there's a strong chance he moves to left at some point (he has a 40 arm).

The big lefty had injury issues, namely with a hip, that led to inconsistent results and concern from the scouting industry about his long-term health. His stock dropped as a result, but the ORGANIZATION used some creative drafting to take him in the ORGANIZATION Round A and sign him for $3.55 million. If he returns to form, he could be well worth the investment. When he's locked in, PERSON has a plus fastball, a solid hard slurve and a changeup that could be at least above-average.

For most of his pro career, ORGANIZATION has displayed a quick left-handed swing, tremendous hand-eye coordination and mature approach. But he hasn't looked the same in 2016, with his bat appearing slower as he has made less hard contact than usual. He draws enough walks to record healthy on-base percentages, though some evaluators question how much over-the-fence power he'll develop. Most of ORGANIZATION's value comes from his bat. He's a decent athlete with fringy speed and arm strength, which doesn't make him much of a factor on the bases or in the outfield.

His fastball's movement pairs well with a power, mid-80s changeup that also has arm side action; PERSON works left-handed hitters away with these two offerings. His curveball has good shape and bite, but PERSON struggles to set it up for whiffs because his fastball is hittable in the top of the zone.

He pitched at two levels upon returning and then made up for lost time with a stint in the ORGANIZATION, setting the stage for a return to the Majors in 2018.A big and physical righty, PERSON operates at 93-97 mph with a fastball that has good sinking action and run that nets him ground-ball outs. His curveball, thrown with powerful 12-to-6 action in the low 80s, receives plus grades from scouts, while his changeup gives him a third pitch, albeit one that he throws too firmly and will need to improve.

Pitching in a rotation for his first two full seasons, the right-hander missed bats and walked batters at a very high rate. That was still the case in 2018 with a move to the bullpen and while the command is still an issue, he pitched well enough to earn a spot on the 40-man roster this past offseason and was called up to the big leagues for the first time in late July.PERSON is now a full-time reliever with the kind of premium stuff to have success in the big leagues if he can find the strike zone a little more consistently. In shorter stints, his fastball can be a true 80 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, hitting triple digits. His curveball is well above average at times and he actually commands his breaking ball better than his heater. PERSON does have an upper-80s changeup that almost plays like a two-seamer, and will get weak contact at times, but he doesn't commit to it enough.A lack of fastball command is the only thing holding PERSON back at this point.

Some evaluators believe PERSON could be considered the top overall player in this year's class, because he has a shorter path to the Major Leagues due to his age and experience. But others give the nod to shortstop PERSON (ORGANIZATION) or left-handed pitcher PERSON (ORGANIZATION) due to their upside. Also working in GPE's favor is his defensive position in the middle of the diamond and his complete package at the plate. PERSON, who played six seasons in GPE, will not be subject to the international signing guidelines if he signs after he turns 23, and therefore stands to have more leverage if he signs after his birthday, because teams would not have to use money from their international bonus pool to sign him.

PERSON's hands have life, and work in a tight little loop as he accelerates them to swing. He can pull and lift balls in various parts of the zone with regularity, and the impact of his contact is only limited by his average bat speed. The physical grind of catching is likely to dilute his in-game offensive production a little bit, but unless the beating he takes back there starts to take away from his defensive abilities (which sometimes happens to young catchers), PERSON is a pretty good bet to have some kind of big league career, and, if the bat maxes out, he'll be an above-average regular. He turns 20 in March and will likely head to Hi-A next year. How his advanced defensive ability and less-advanced bat develop could affect how quickly the GPE push him: slowly if they want to wait for the latter or, depending on how much he hits early as a big leaguer, quickly if they dont.","label":0}

He spent 2015 rehabilitating his elbow and turned down the Indians as a 38th-round pick before enrolling at GPE. A rare Draft-eligible freshman, he led the LOCATION with 128 strikeouts in 102 innings before going to the ORGANIZATION in the third round of the 2016 Draft. PERSON's development accelerated in 2018, and the right-hander finished the year with a strong performance at ORGANIZATION, striking out 10 batters and allowing one hit in his final regular-season start, then firing another six-inning, one-hit gem in the LOCATION playoffs. He struggled to build on that progress in 2019, as a combination of control problems and diminished stuff led to a demotion from PERSON back to Class A Advanced GPE, and he ultimately landed on the injured list with tightness in the back of his shoulder in June. PERSON's power stuff is headlined by a plus fastball-curveball combo. His heater currently sits in the mid-90s with riding life, and there's a chance he adds even more velocity as he continues to distance himself from the surgery. His curveball, meanwhile, is a 12-to-6 hammer that he throws with power in the mid- to upper-70s. Together, the two pitches give PERSON the ability to induce ugly swings-and-misses, which he did at a near 15 percent clip in 2018, while averaging 9.5 strikeouts-per-nine. PERSON's split-changeup gives him a third above-average-or-better pitch, one that at times can be almost as effective as his curveball. While PERSON's dynamic arsenal and room for improvement give him a chance to remain a starter, most scouts project him as a reliever long-term because he doesn't have an athletic delivery, doesn't consistently throw strikes and his command is even more sporadic. He does create deception with his mechanics and does a good job attacking hitters north and south, using an aggressive nature that could work well in a high-leverage bullpen role.","label":0}

{"text":"PERSON is one of the more heavily scouted underclassman high school prospects in recent memory, and stood out hitting in the heart of the lineup for GPE powerhouse GPE, for various Team USA squads, and at travel showcases and tournaments. Some of this success was probably because PERSON was one of the oldest prospects in the 2019 graduating class, which prompted him to accelerate his schooling in 2017 and reclassify for the 2018 draft. Moving up a year made him age-appropriate for a high schooler in their draft year; at 18.4, he was basically average for a prep player. With that early-career acclaim came a change in the way opposing pitchers approached PERSON. They began to pitch around him, and scouts often left PERSON games having seen him swing just once or twice because he was constantly walking. PERSON had a long track record of hitting in games, had participated in multiple home run derbies during his amateur summers, and posted gaudy exit velocities during team pre-draft workouts, so clubs knew what his offensive potential was. He has good hands and a plus arm that helped him pitch into the low-90's on the mound, but is a well-below average runner with poor lateral mobility. He played third base after signing (mostly during instructs though, as PERSON injured his thumb sliding for a ground ball in June, needed surgery, and barely played during the summer) but expectations are he'll move across the diamond to first base in 2019 or 2020, where we think he'll be quite good. PERSON' calling card is his bat and there's potential for a 60 hit, 70 game power, 80 raw power kind of package. The margin for error for a teenage first base-only types is very small, but we're also very high on PERSON' bat.","label":0}

Of the half-dozen college players at that position who have legitimate first-round aspirations in 2019, he might be the best pure hitter.His outstanding hand-eye coordination allows PERSON to put the bat on the ball with ease. A left-handed hitter who's a bit unorthodox at the plate, he tends to get caught out on his front foot but still has the dexterity to slap singles to the opposite field. He also has the bat speed and leverage in his still-projectable 6-foot-4 frame to turn on balls, hinting at average power in his future.PERSON grew up around the game because his father PERSON is the head coach at PERSON-Dallas, and his instincts are apparent on the bases and in the field.

After moving at a level-per-year pace through their system, PERSON was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON in September 2016. He's made strides in his first season with the ORGANIZATION, showing improvement on both sides of the ball while earning All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON is a switch-hitter and has a quick, compact swing from both sides of the plate. His power has improved in each of his four Minor League campaigns, and scouts believe he'll offer at least average power once fully developed. He does most of his damage from the left side of the plate, where he balances a mature approach with some feel to hit and above-average raw power.

Hoping that the latter would develop, the ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the third round and signed him for pick value.PERSON showed the ability to hit for average and power at times for the ORGANIZATION, reaching double digits in home runs as both a freshman and sophomore. That power didn't show up as much in his junior season, but some of that is because of a more refined approach at the plate and a willingness to take what pitchers gave him. He was pitched away a lot, and rather than sell out for power, he tried to not do too much, and many scouts feel the pop is very much still there.PERSON caught a few times this spring, but not enough for teams to have a real comfort level with how he looks back there. The ORGANIZATION, however, are willing to give him a chance behind the plate, though it's fair to wonder if it might slow down his advanced bat too much.

PERSON then double-jumped PERSON up to Double-A and his overall numbers suffered as a result, though he still finished third in the system in strikeouts and batting average against. He also was much stronger in the second half (3.73 ERA) than in the first (5.90), largely because of improved command and a big drop in his walk rate. He'll throw his fastball up to 94 mph with arm side run and he can reach back for a little extra when he needs it. His changeup is his best secondary offering, with excellent deception and sink. His curve shows flashes of being average, an 11-to-5 breaking ball that's still a work in progress.

He has a mid-90s sinker and plus changeup, which should enable him to pitch in middle relief.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON' opinions about where on the defensive spectrum PERSON will end up are all over the map. He got quite big not long after he was drafted and seemed destined for first base, and while there's still a chance he ends up there eventually, he looked leaner last year and has a better chance of staying at third for a while. Some clubs think he'll move to right field, and the contact issues PERSON has had due to his lever length are problematic if he doesn't stay at third.\nWe're intrigued by the three-true outcomes possibilities here, as PERSON already has huge power and might grow into more, and he's also had some of the higher walk rates in all of the minor leagues. Opposing pitchers are going to have to be careful with him or risk paying a 400 foot price, so we expect his on base ability to hold water at the upper levels. He could reach Double-A Akron as a 21-year-old later in the year if he performs during the spring.","label":0}
{"text":" There is no question that PERSON is ready to defend behind the plate at the big league level. That was apparent even before he got his first callup, a trip cut very short in his first game by an ankle sprain (he made it back up in September).

He's made strides with the bat as well  he hit very well post-injury in 2012  and could be a fringy hitter.

When he moved back up a level in 2012, he took the ORGANIZATION by storm, earning a promotion to Double-A. There is little PERSON can't do on the field. He has tremendous bat speed, which should help him develop more power, and improved plate discipline has been a key to him becoming a better all-around hitter.

Hes vulnerable up in the strike zone and has middling bat control because of all the effort in the swing, but there is pop here.

PERSON's defensive ability was in place when he arrived for camp in the spring. By the start of the summer, he had already filled out a bit and started putting a serious charge into the baseball during BP and, occasionally, in games. That thump tapered off later in the year and PERSON has some swing length issues that will likely make him strikeout prone, but it's possible he was just tired in GPE and that there's some pop here, too.

His fastball moves, and he can run it back onto his gloveside corner or just off the plate to his arm side. But it's hard to say if PERSON will grow into more fastball because his frame is already maxed out. The scouting reports of rising high school seniors PERSON and ORGANIZATION read an awful lot like that before each of them altered their training and conditioning, and experienced a huge jump in velocity. PERSON is a candidate for 'reverse projection' in this way is hard to say, but it's fair to assume some growth on the fastball through sheer physical maturity.

The following year he missed a few games after taking a bad hop to the face, and he'd later be shut down for the season when he fractured a fibula and tore an ankle ligament while sliding into second base.

It looks, however, like PERSON has put much of that, as well as shoulder and blister issues that kept him off the mound until July, behind him after an absolutely dominant stint in relief in the GPE League in 2017, a strong move up to Double-A and a trip to the ORGANIZATION in 2018.When healthy -- and he has had some shoulder issues in the past -- PERSON has some nasty stuff well-suited for short relief. He throws his fastball regularly in the mid-to-upper 90s with some serious late life. His slider is a true wipeout pitch that greatly contributed to his insane 16.4 K\/9 rate in GPE last year. The fastball-slider combination was devastating to hitters particularly because he threw strikes at a better rate than he ever has.PERSON took a huge step forward in terms of maturity and understanding what it takes to be a professional pitcher here.

He will stay at shortstop long-term, with as strong of an arm as anyone in the system, an absolute rifle, though he's also seen some time at second and a little at third. His other defensive skills are well above-average, with outstanding hands and excellent range, even though he's just an average runner. PERSON still needs to add strength to become an offensive contributor. He has a solid approach and will draw walks, but there is no power to speak of. The hope is he'll mature enough to shoot balls to the gaps.Even with the false start in 2015, PERSON is still ahead of the curve in terms of age for his level.

It looks like PERSON--though PERSON doesn't have that kind of raw pop--or late-career PERSON.

GPE, long lauded for his makeup, made some adjustments to remedy the timing issues that plagued him in 2017. His front hip is clearing earlier, enabling him to catch some of the inside pitches that were tying him up last year.

GPE struck out in 29.3% of his 2018 plate appearances and had a 17.5% swinging strike rate, the latter of which would rank as the 15th most frequent ORGANIZATION% in the majors last year. GPE swings through pitches in the zone fairly frequently and despite his prodigious physical abilities, his offensive profile feels unstable. His up-the-middle defensive profile gives him some wiggle room on offense, but he's not a very instinctive defender and is closer to average in center field than one might expect given his speed. Players can succeed despite heavy strikeouts; PERSON's skillset looks an awful lot like GPE's (power, strikeouts, and a pedestrian defense at a premium position) and PERSON was a 3 WAR player last year.

The likelihood of this is bolstered by the polished nature of PERSON's bat. His feel for the strike zone and his timing are both impressive for his age, and he is adept at attacking early-count pitches he can drive, while taking tough strikes. It helps him run deep counts and walk as well as hit for power.

So judicious is PERSON's eye for the plate that if he were cloned 15 times and each clone forced to be an umpire, there might be a lot less talk of electronic strike zones. He identifies balls and strikes early in flight and often relaxes before balls have even entered the catcher's mitt. There's a chance that PERSON's lack of power (he has more from the right side) limits the way his eye for the zone plays in the big leagues, since pitchers will be more likely to attack him without fear of him doing damage on his own. Most of his doubles come by slashing balls down either baseline, or when he turns gappers into extra bases because of his speed. We think there's enough bat to retain most of the on-base ability PERSON has shown so far and that, combined with his multi-positional versatility, could yield super-utility value. \nThough he spent all of last year playing either second base or shortstop, PERSON also has experience in both outfield corners and at third base. The ORGANIZATION added PERSON to the 40-man this offseason and while they're well-stocked on the infield (PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, GPE), they're rather thin in the outfield, and very right-handed.

But while PERSON has mid-rotation, big league stuff, his career has been beset by constant, often severe, injury. Since entering pro ball in 2013, PERSON has only thrown about 200 career innings due to repeated injury and rehab, and his 68 innings pitched for the ORGANIZATION during his first pro campaign remain his single-season high. He missed all of 2014 with injury, then was released, and out of pro baseball for all of 2015. The ORGANIZATION unearthed him during the 2016 23U World Championships in GPE and after a frantic late-night call from scout PERSON, signed PERSON immediately. Just two innings into his first 2016 start, PERSON's velocity dropped into the mid-80s and he left the mound pointing at his elbow. He rehabbed quickly enough that he was able to make 11 short starts with PERSON the following year. \nBecause PERSON signed in 2012, he would have been Rule 5 eligible in the winter of 2017. The ORGANIZATION added him to the 40-man even though he had never completed a healthy start in full-season ball. In 2018, PERSON ascended quickly and showed flashes of brilliance against big league hitters, but he also made two more trips to the disabled list, including a late-season stint due to shoulder inflammation. Shoulder issues have sidelined PERSON pretty frequently during his career, and while he may have some years where he peaks in the 3-4 WAR range, we also think he'll have some years where he barely pitches, or that he may just move to the bullpen.","label":1}

PERSON' command is enough to start and his changeup flashes average, but some scouts project him as a ORGANIZATION Gregerson-like slider-heavy reliever, both because of his arm action and his slider-heavy approach. In today's velocity-obsessed game, PERSON' only ability that is above average is his slider and he leans on it heavily, which would make him ideal for a multi-inning hybrid role and doesn't describe many traditional big league starters.

The type of contact PERSON makes is unique. He employs a punchy, minimalist swing, and just kind of throws the bat head at the baseball, leading to lots of opposite field contact. It's worked so far, and PERSON has hit for enough contact to outweigh the total lack of game power that results from this kind of approach. It's unlikely that this is an PERSONn situation where all of a sudden there's power, because PERSON was pulling the ball in the minors. \nMostly because his actions are quite good, PERSON fits fine at second base.

After having no problems handling the ORGANIZATION State League in 2016 and finishing things off with a playoff win in Double-A GPE, he was set to start the year back in GPE, but an 80-game suspension levied at the start of the 2017 season for a performance-enhancing drug put some of that progress in question.PERSON is more or less a three-pitch guy who relies on mixing his pitches well, though he has seen an uptick in the velocity of his fastball. He was up to 95 mph consistently at the end of last summer. He can spin a good curveball and he'll even mix in an occasional slider. His changeup looks like it could give him another Major League average pitch. PERSON's secondary pitches have improved enough that it keeps hitters honest and allows him to get swings and misses on his fastball.PERSON exudes confidence on the mound and stays around the strike zone. His mix is better than any one of his pitches, and he was looking like a future mid-rotation starter, though he'll have to prove himself all over again following his suspension.","label":0}
{"text":"Some international evaluators had a longer history of seeing PERSON than area scouts did, as PERSON spent his freshman and draft-eligible sophomore seasons at two different schools, but he's been pitching for GPE's national team since 2014. A dual citizen, PERSON was the first ever GPE to have his name called during baseball's draft. His stuff drastically improved once he began to be nurtured by the ORGANIZATION' player development machine, and PERSON'd more hitters over 131 innings of work in 2018 than he did during his entire college career. His fastball has middling velocity but it's lively, and PERSON's arm slot is tough on righties. Both of his secondaries are capable of missing bats and while PERSON lacks pinpoint command, he throws enough strikes to start. Before he was part of the ORGANIZATION trade, PERSON projected as a No. 4 or 5 starter or multi-inning reliever. We think he's best suited for the latter role, but given the rebuilding nature of the GPE, he'll likely begin his big league career as a starter.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON changed his college commitment late (he was originally going to play two sports at GPE), and headed to ORGANIZATION. After struggling as a freshman and sophomore, he arrived for his junior season with a better body and quieter swing. He sent many non-conference pitches rocketing into PERSON's midnight sky before he started seeing -- and swinging over top of -- lots of Pac-12 breaking balls. Whether this is fixable has been the subject of many debates in draft rooms in the early first round. PERSON has rare physical tools for a college hitter. He's a plus runner and will post 70 run times to first on occasion with solid feel for center field and huge, playable power, so there's a chance for stardom here even if PERSON ends up with a below-average hit tool. It's unclear why PERSON's arm strength and accuracy became issues this year after they were assets earlier in his career, but it's such a small aspect of his skillset that it shouldn't be a concern unless his medical indicates it's a chronic issue. Less stable than the college hitters ranked above him, PERSON has as much upside.","label":0}

PERSON pitched in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON during his first season with his third organization but also saw his control and command regress significantly.With a quick arm and little effort, PERSON sits at 95-98 mph with the ability to reach triple digits in the late innings. He has thrown as hard as 103 mph but his velocity is more impressive than his fastball command, and the latter will dictate how quickly he moves up the ladder. He also can miss bats with his power slider and a changeup that's improving as he uses it more.He's similar to fellow PERSON power righties PERSON and PERSON, though scouts are less optimistic about PERSON's ability to harness his stuff. His walk rate jumped from 2.4 per nine innings in 2017 to 6.0 last year.

He hit 15 homers in just 29 games, slugging .818 during that span. The hitting environment in GPE caricatured his pop, but there's impact power here if PERSON can get to enough of it to profile in right. He's posted above-average walk rates over his last 600 plate appearances, which takes some pressure off the hit tool. This is a traditional, power\/whiff right field profile who is starting to prove he has an approach.","label":0}

He'll more typically sit in the 89-92 mph range, leaving some wondering if he has the capacity to hit the mid-90s with more consistency in the pro game. His curve is fringy at times, better when he stays on top of it. He has a quick arm and his delivery does add some deception. The effort in that delivery does make it a bit more difficult for him to find the strike zone more consistently.A team that feels it can unlock that plus velocity out of PERSON is likely to take him in the earlier rounds, thinking a lefty setup man might evolve. At worst, PERSON does have the deception to be a specialist down the line.","label":0}

That he did so in GPE, one of the worst hitting environments in the ORGANIZATION, was even more impressive. PERSON showed some of his raw power in the first half, but he expanded his strike zone too much. To his credit, he adjusted, and his walk rate skyrocketed while his strikeout rate came down. PERSON has plus power potential, and his improved hittability could allow him to tap into it more consistently in the future. PERSON is an average runner with an arm a tick above average, with enough of each to play a capable right field.

He'll go much higher now after showcasing one of the best curveballs in the LOCATION and transitioning from the bullpen to the rotation. There's still a divide as to what his best long-term role will be, with one scout paralleling him to the ORGANIZATION' best player ever, PERSON Kimbrel.PERSON's curveball is a legitimate out pitch that reaches the low 80s and has sharp bite. He sits around 90-93 mph with life on his fastball and usually touches 95-96 with less movement a couple of times each game. After not using a changeup much for most of his ORGANIZATION career, he started incorporating one more often late this season and it shows the potential to become at least an average pitch.PERSON's delivery is smoother when he operates in the low 90s but features effort and head whack when he pushes into the mid-90s. Scouts who like the ORGANIZATION recruit as a starter point to his three pitches and believe he can learn to pace himself better and improve his control. Others see him as a late-inning weapon who could attack hitters with his curve and fastball.","label":0}

At the plate, he has a fairly good approach and has shown pretty good gap power so far, though it looks like he might grow into more in the future.

Though he worked just 17 2\/3 innings in his pro debut, that was long enough to establish as one of the best ground-ball pitchers in the system.GPE pounds the bottom of the strike zone with a heavy 90-94 mph sinker that has the GPE wondering if he might be the second coming of PERSON. They're going to have him add a four-seamer he can elevate to change batters' eye level. He can get some swings and misses with his average slider but he needs more work on his changeup. GPE operates from a low three-quarters arm slot and has effort in his delivery, so some scouts project him as a reliever. PERSON will develop him as a starter, believing that his athleticism and strike-throwing ability can keep him in the rotation.

He also only throws in the low-90s\/upper-80s, but he locates it in spots that make it difficult for hitters to punish, and his funky, low-3\/4s arm slot disorients them, especially lefties. His delivery, fastball command, and ability to dump his curveball in for strikes should be enough for him to deal with lefties and PERSON's best pitch, a late-sinking, bat-missing changeup, could be enough to keep righties at bay. The report reads like a that of fifth starter, a 40 FV. But PERSON's age and what might be an innings limit coming off of surgery are at odds with one another, and ideally we'd like a pitcher firmly in his mid-20s to be a big league lock for 2019, so we've shaded down his FV beneath his true evaluation.","label":0}

He leans more contact-oriented in his approach, but often won't make consistent hard contact, with some timing, pitch recognition, and plate coverage shortcomings at present. He seems likely to reach the upper minors and with some improvement, would get on a 40-man roster and get at least some big league time.

And while solid at short, PERSON's not so good that you'd live with zero offense and play him everyday. He'll likely be a glove-first utility guy, but he hasn't played much second or third base yet and he's already 24.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON was a regular on GPE's PERSON Series runner-up club in 2016 and batted .376 in the ORGANIZATION that summer, falling a few plate appearances short of qualifying for and winning the batting title. He led the Pacific-12 Conference with a .383 average and ORGANIZATION Division I with a Wildcats-record 30 doubles in 2017 before the ORGANIZATION drafted him with a supplemental second-round pick received from the ORGANIZATION as punishment for a hacking scandal. He homered 22 times in his first full pro season, spending most of 2018 in high Class A.Since adopting a power-over-hit approach in pro ball, PERSON has generated some of the best exit velocities in the system. His strength combined with the quickness and loft in his left-handed swing gives him natural pop to all fields. He has adjustments to make, however, because he can get beat with velocity up in the strike zone and struggled against southpaws with a .186\/.270\/.279 line last year.PERSON has to mash because he offers little value beyond his bat. He lacks quickness and athleticism and is a below-average defender in left field, where he has an average arm yet registered just one assist in 105 games in his first two years as a pro.

There's a chance he bounces back, but college starters often just never throw as hard as they did in school due to increased usage and a longer season, and that's possible in this case, too.

ORGANIZATION has also made on-field progress throughout 2018. Early in the season, he was wild. As it wore on, some mechanical issues were ironed out, and his changeup feel turned a corner through increased use. He dominated for long stretches of games during the second half of the season, including a commanding July during which he allowed just 10 hits and struck out 39 in 26.2 innings. The strike-throwing is still not great, but it has gotten better, and ORGANIZATION's stuff is really good. At around 6-feet even, ORGANIZATION is short but he's thick and strong, and scouts aren't worried his durability. He has mid-rotation upside if his command continues to progress.

He has a live arm and a free and easy delivery, which brings fastballs that touch 95 mph with good movement. His secondary stuff is more inconsistent, though he's shown glimpses of a strong, tilting slider and an effective changeup.

He manages the strike zone well but doesn't make consistent hard contact, and there are mixed opinions about his bat -- just as there were with PERSON, whom PERSON made a full-time pitcher after selecting him No. 38 overall last June. PERSON, who was the ORGANIZATION' closer, PERSON has received little exposure on the mound to this point.

He combines it with a hard diving slider, giving him a second plus out pitch. His command is fringy, and he struggled with the strike zone during his first full season at times. He has the makeup and competitive fire for a back-end-of-the-bullpen guy and wants the ball in pressure situations. The ORGANIZATION typically don't let young relievers pitch the ninth inning only, especially in the lower Minors.

While he might run into a few homers along the way, he's definitely an average over power kind of hitter. Before the injury, PERSON's athleticism and speed were by far his best tool, with some putting a 70 on his run tool. It's more of a 60 now, though it's trending upward the further removed from surgery he becomes. He's a solid defender in center field with a decent arm.The more PERSON looks like his pre-injury self, the more his name was moving up boards, with some buzz as early as the third round.

He's a big-framed guy with average stuff that plays up due to extension and his fastball has life that competes in the strike zone. Realistically he's a fifth or sixth starter but let's see how the fastball plays and what happens to the velocity when PERSON is handled in a way that prioritizes development rather than winning Big 12 games.","label":0}

He was PAC-12 Freshman of the Year in his first season, then hit .402 with 23 homers in 2018 to win the ORGANIZATION as an underclassman, a rare feat. He's continued to hit during his GPE season, putting him in position to be one of the first players chosen in the first round.PERSON could very well be the best all-around hitter in this GPE class. He has a very advanced approach at the plate, one that has allowed him to walk much more than he has struck out throughout his GPE career, with a knack for barreling up the baseball. He doesn't sacrifice power as a result, showing the ability to hit the ball out to all fields, profiling as a true middle-of-the-order run producer in the future. He's a first baseman only, though he thinks he could handle third or the outfield, but should be fine at first, with decent hands and a solid arm that allowed him to pitch as a freshman.After a relatively ordinary summer with ORGANIZATION, PERSON got back to mashing baseballs during his final college season. He is very much in the conversation at the very top of the GPE as a college hitter who should be able to move quickly through a system.","label":0}

He's the son of former big league outfielder PERSON, who coached him at ORGANIZATION's PERSON High.A physical presence at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds, PERSON topped the ORGANIZATION with 21 homers and 84 RBIs during the spring. He pairs a smooth left-handed swing with considerable strength, though some scouts wonder if he has enough bat speed to pound big league fastballs. He improved his plate discipline and pitch recognition during his Draft year, increasing his chances of hitting for average and getting the most out of his massive raw power. PERSON moves well for his size but still grades as a well-below-average runner.

The 6-foot-5, 235-pounder sits at 91-94 mph and touches 96, though his heater gets hit more than it should because it tends to straighten out. PERSON's secondary pitches are still a work in progress. His improving cutter is his No. 2 option, he's not afraid to throw his firm changeup and he also has a curveball that often devolves into a slurve. He does a nice job of using his height to drive his pitches down in the strike zone.

While his stuff hasn't been as sharp during his junior season, he still has one of the higher floors as a starter among college pitchers and is a lock to become the first Paladin ever drafted in the first five rounds.PERSON reached 96 mph with nasty sink on his fastball during fall ball, but he has pitched more at 88-92 and topped out at 94 with a less heavy heater this spring. He has full trust in his changeup, which shows signs of becoming a plus pitch but has graded more as an average offering in 2017. The same is true of his curveball and cutter, which flashed solid more often in the past.While he isn't especially big, PERSON has gotten stronger during three years of college.

He had to repeat short-season ball to begin his first full pro season but reached Double-A midway through his second.His fastball sat around 90 mph when PERSON turned pro and since has climbed to a steady 92-94 with a high of 97. He uses both a four-seamer at the higher end of his velocity range and a two-seamer with cutting action in the low 90s. His curveball has depth and gives him a second solid pitch, and he shows the ability to land it for strikes or bury it in the dirt.PERSON's changeup has flashes of effectiveness but needs more consistency to help him deal with left-handers. He challenges hitters, works ahead in the count and uses a high three-quarters arm slot to overcome his height and provide downward angle.

He can hit for average, with good plate discipline, and he makes consistent hard contact with solid bat speed. That should allow him to hit for some power along the way. He's a fringy runner, but a smart and aggressive baserunner.

The right-hander spent parts of three summers in the ORGANIZATION and didn't make it to full-season ball until 2014. A move to the bullpen in 2015, however, kick-started his career, and allowed him to reach Triple-A at age 23 in 2016. Now in shorter stints, GPE can focus on his power arsenal. His fastball now sits in the mid 90s and touches 98 mph. He mixes in a slider and a cutter as well, going right after hitters. He's missing more bats, giving up fewer hits and getting more groundball outs -- a skill the ORGANIZATION love to see from their young pitchers -- than he did when he was a starter. He's also walking fewer batters, and overall command isn't as big of an issue coming out of the bullpen.Neverauskus, who tossed a scoreless frame in the 2016 PERSON, has gotten the chance to close in Triple-A.

A reliever during his summer debut, PERSON's move to the rotation in the LOCATION during his first full season in 2017 has made him a much more intriguing prospect.As a reliever, PERSON was up to 97 mph with his fastball with a very good breaking ball. He didn't lose a ton when he became a starter in June, throwing his heater in the 92-95 mph range, occasionally touching 96 mph. His curve has the chance to be a plus pitch eventually and while his changeup is behind the other two, he has shown some feel for it and it could give him a third at least PERSON average offering in the future. PERSON missed bats and got ground-ball outs, while showing he can throw strikes with his fastball-curve combination, maintaining his velocity throughout his starts.In a system with a lot of young pitching talent, PERSON's emergence in GPE in 2017 was a very pleasant surprise. There's some ceiling here, with the chance to start long-term, though the ORGANIZATION know he could move quickly back in the bullpen if needed.","label":0}

That has given the projectable right-hander a lot more exposure and from ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION and throughout the spring, the ORGANIZATION commit has risen to the occasion.GPE's spring has moved him up to the upper-echelon group of high school arms. He flashes three plus pitches, carrying his fastball deep into starts and showing an improved slider with new life. His slider was more of a cutter at first, with not a ton of tilt to it, then it was slurvy, and now it's often a plus three-quarters power breaker he throws for strikes. He's not afraid to throw a changeup when he needs it, but he doesn't need it. With his clean and easy delivery, he should develop more consistent command.With a strong spring against a much higher level of competition to go along with high grades for his leadership and work ethic, there's a big up arrow next to GPE's name and he was moving up firmly into the first round as the ORGANIZATION approached.","label":0}

He bounced back in 2016 to set career highs across the board at ORGANIZATION, including a .337 average, 1.032 ORGANIZATION and 14 homers, before signing for full slot value ($262,700) in the sixth round despite being a senior. At 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, PERSON looks the part of a big leaguer. He's a switch-hitter with bat speed, strength and impressive raw power from both sides of the plate. He needs to improve his plate discipline, though he has made some strides in 2016 and is doing a better job of laying off breaking pitches and taking walks when pitchers refuse to challenge him.Though the ORGANIZATION stationed him almost exclusively in left field during his pro debut, PERSON is equipped to play right field.

He works counts well and will be more of an on-base guy than a power source, though he is starting to drive the ball more consistently. He has solid speed but is still learning the nuances of basestealing.A center fielder in his first two pro seasons, PERSON played mostly left field in 2015 before returning to center this year. He's still refining his reads and routes and needs to stick in center to have a chance to make it as a regular because he lacks the profile power for the corner. His below-average arm means he won't see much time in right field.","label":1}

The ORGANIZATION began converting PERSON from third base to catcher during instructional league following the 2013 season, and the early returns have been extremely positive. His arm strength is a plus, and he already shows aptitude for blocking balls and calling pitches. He still needs to refine his receiving and his transfers on throws.Though PERSON hit just .247 in his first three pro seasons, there have been some positive signs at the plate.

He has some pop, but not a ton of over-the-fence power right now. That might be an issue based on where he likely profiles best defensively. While he has played some center field, he is better suited for a corner spot. He runs the bases well, with his speed and outstanding instincts serving him well in the outfield as well. If the power doesn't come, he may not have the kind of impact bat teams like to have in a corner spot every day, so PERSON's future may be as a valuable fourth outfielder type.

He pitches with average velocity, dialing his fastball up to 92-93 mph as needed while also commanding it with aplomb. His best pitch is a plus slider in the upper 80s, and he has feel for mixing in a curveball and a changeup as well even though both pitches currently grade as below average. What's more, PERSON is an exceptional strike-thrower with each of his four pitches and issued just 0.8 walks per nine innings in 2017. PERSON's ability to start coming out of college was met with some skepticism, but he's proved plenty durable early in his career while also producing results. That said, PERSON's fastball-slider pairing could also make him a bullpen asset, and get him to the ORGANIZATION ahead of schedule, though GPE has no intention of adjusting his role just yet.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON was a projection prep arm from GPE whose price was just high enough to get him to GPE.

PERSON continued at about that level for the next two seasons, slinging in a heavy, 91-96 mph sinker from a low slot with a deceptive, crossfire delivery. He threw strikes and had a plus slider. Scouts who weren't as enthusiastic about PERSON's changeup, or arm slot, or the length of his arm action saw a reliever. His stuff would flatten out and his command would back up as he fatigued into the late stages of some starts. The ORGANIZATION had PERSON change his delivery and arm action for the first half-dozen or so starts in 2018, focusing on a more traditional four-seam fastball approach. It didn't work, and GPE let PERSON go back to what he had been doing later in the year, and his dominant final two months of 2018 reflect his comfort with this approach. We think the likely outcome here is a multi-inning power reliever who dominates righties with strikeouts and groundballs, though some see a starter in the mold of PERSON.

PERSON is described as a running back playing baseball due to his sneaky athleticism in a compact frame, his all-out style, and standout work ethic. Depending on whom you ask, he's either a 70 or 80 runner, but his instincts on the bases and in the field aren't up to snuff just yet. Since there isn't much raw power presently, he plays more of a slap-and-dash, small-ball game that accentuates his speed.

He's added a lot of strength and now tops 200 pounds, a far cry from the 155 he weighed when he signed. The right-hander throws what's best described as \"easy gas\" that gets up to 95-96 mph consistently, coming from a very quick arm. He shows he can spin an improving breaking ball, but both his curve and his changeup are inconsistent and need to be refined. PERSON can get too amped up on the mound and needs to learn to manage his effort level, with an understanding that his stuff will still be there when he does so.It's possible PERSON's high energy style to go along with his fastball-curve combination, might be best suited coming out of the bullpen.

Taken No. 3 overall and signed for a franchise-record bonus of $5.5 million, he's lived up to that billing by hitting pretty much everywhere he's been, going to the ORGANIZATION Game twice and reaching Triple-A just before his 22nd birthday.

PERSON was exactly as advertised for the first two years of his pro career, and reached Double-A during his first full pro season though, as predicted, he hit for very little power, including a paltry .399 SLG% in the offensive paradise that is the ORGANIZATION. \nIn 2018, PERSON added a more exaggerated leg kick and began lifting the ball more. A 45% ground ball rate at Double-A in 2017 turned into a 31% rate at Mobile the following year. He was eventually promoted to ORGANIZATION PERSON and ended up with more 2018 homers (16) than he had had in his previous two years combined. Will the change be enough? It's going to be close. PERSON posted a 102 wRC+ in 85 games as a 23-year-old at ORGANIZATION; the big league average at first base last year was 105. We have him projected as a low-end regular there, which might make him a viable alternative to PERSON and PERSON fairly soon.","label":1}
{"text":"GPE was a two-sport star as a GPE prep, standing out on the diamond while also excelling as a hockey player. He focused his efforts on the diamond by heading to the ORGANIZATION of GPE and took full advantage of scouts pouring in to see first-round teammates PERSON and PERSON. That exposure, along with his impressive track record that included an ORGANIZATION campaign in the 2016 Cape Cod League, endeared him to the GPE, who selected him the fourth round.GPE has the offensive profile of a top-of-the-order table setter. He has excellent feel for the barrel and contact skills from the right side of the plate. He proved to be one of the toughest college hitters to strike out in the country throughout his GPE career, fanning just 31 times in 841 plate appearances (3.7 percent). An above-average-to-plus runner, GPE does have some basestealing ability. Defensively, he split time between second and center field as a freshman and sophomore, moved to shortstop as a junior and then split time between both middle-infield positions during his pro debut. He profiles better at the keystone, where his average arm and solid range are better fits. GPE doesn't have the frame or strength to consistently impact the baseball, and that might limit his ceiling to being a super-utlity type of player who mostly sees time at second. While he has the tools to offer plenty valuable in that role, it also would be unwise to bet against GPE, who has long been lauded for his makeup and work ethic, becoming an everyday player.","label":0}

Pitching downhill, he's able to generate groundballs when he's on. His best secondary pitch is his curve, which will flash as an average breaking ball, and his changeup has the chance to be average as well.

It was a disappointing season for PERSON overall, though, as he posted the lowest average of his career (.228) while moving down the defensive spectrum in Triple-A. The 2017 season has brought slightly better results for the ORGANIZATION native, as he surpassed his home run total from the previous in just a half season in GPE Coast League, where he was named a midseason All-Star.PERSON generates plus raw power thanks to a combination of bat speed and physical strength, but he sells out for it too often, employing a pull-heavy approach that limits the overall utility of his bat. He made strides with his plate discipline at Double-A in 2015, only to regress last season with the move up to Triple-A, where his strikeout rate increased by nearly 6 percent from the previous year. PERSON's strikeout rate continued to spike in 2017, casting even greater doubt about his ability to hit for any semblance of average.PERSON's offensive struggles followed him into the field last season, as he led all GPE Coast League third basemen in errors (21) despite appearing in just 89 games at the hot corner. As a below-average defender and runner without a true position, PERSON profiles more as an up-and-down bench bat more than an everyday option.","label":1}

He can impact the baseball with a solid hit tool and a good amount of raw power to tap into. Frequently pitched around this spring, he's shown he can be patient and not try to do too much. When healthy and playing defensively, he has shown decent receiving skills and an accurate arm, though that obviously is a concern.Without plus tools, PERSON' best selling point was his all-around package as a big strong left-handed hitter who can stay behind the plate.

To his credit, he put it behind him, hit his way out of PERSON once he was assigned, but then willingly returned there to help win a GPE ORGANIZATION title as the ORGANIZATION' cleanup hitter after PERSON got hurt.PERSON's power-speed combination makes him a very intriguing prospect. He has plus raw power that is eye-popping when he is on time at the plate, and he'll have to continue to refine his approach in order to make enough contact to tap into that power. His speed is also a game-changer -- he finished third in the organization in stolen bases in just 104 games in 2018 -- and if it all comes together, he has 20-20 potential.His speed also gives him plenty of range to play center field, but he's likely destined for left field because of his below-average arm.

He has good feel for his curveball, showing the ability to throw it for a strike and also bury it in the dirt when vying for whiffs, and he's adept at adding and subtracting with the pitch as needed. His changeup gives him a third average-or-better offering, albeit one he uses sparingly, and he has good command of all three pitches.Because he lacks a plus pitch and thrives based on deception, PERSON will have to prove himself at each level.

PERSON's changeup lags behind the two offerings, which has caused problems against right-handed hitters throughout his career.That the ORGANIZATION adjusted PERSON's mechanics following the trade contributed to his success as starter in 2015, as it allowed the left-hander to make better use of his athleticism and repeat his delivery with more consistency.

The ORGANIZATION tried him a shortstop last year, but he made 13 errors in 34 games and his below-average speed and quickness weren't a good fit. He has the arm strength to make all the throws from third and to possibly consider a career on the mound if hitting doesn't work out.","label":1}

A third baseman for PERSON, it remains to be seen if PERSON can stay at third, with some thinking a defensive move is in store for him. That shouldn't matter. If he reaches his offensive potential, his bat should play just fine at first or a corner outfield spot.PERSON wasn't just a home run hitter on the Cape.

His fastball's movement pairs well with a power, mid-80s changeup that also has arm side action; PERSON works left-handed hitters away with these two offerings. His curveball has good shape and bite, but PERSON struggles to set it up for whiffs because his fastball is hittable in the top of the zone. He needs a weapon that works in on the hands of lefties, like a cutter. If he can find one, he'll be a fine backend starter.","label":1}

He swings the bat well, with solid bat speed and a good approach at the plate, giving him the chance to hit for average with average power. He runs well, though some of the leg issues he's had might contribute to him slowing down a touch. Initially a center fielder, he switched over to left field in 2015.Turning 24 in late July, there is some pressure for PERSON to start moving.

He does, however, get pull happy and needs to find the middle of the field more consistently, though he's been better from the left side than the right thus far in terms of his hit tool. When he gets too big, he gets himself into trouble and needs to trust that his raw power will show up naturally. A fair third baseman with a strong arm, PERSON started getting some time at first in 2016, partially because some thought he'd have to move there eventually, and partially to improve his versatility with other more advanced defenders at the hot corner in the organization.On both sides of the ball, PERSON needs to find some consistency to reach his ultimate potential.

Then he got suspended for four starts in April for repeated violations of university and athletic department policy, returned in May for three relief appearances and got kicked off the team permanently. Those off-the-field issues didn't scare away the ORGANIZATION, who signed PERSON for $2.8 million after taking him with the ORGANIZATION. 25 overall pick.

His changeup might be a touch behind the other three, but it's a usable weapon and he will throw it at times with above-average deception and movement. While PERSON struggled a little with command during his junior year, he is physical and athletic enough to repeat his delivery and throw more than enough strikes. His combination of size, stuff and projectability point to a future frontline starter, one who should move up the ORGANIZATION ladder quickly.","label":1}

He capped it off with a very strong performance in the ORGANIZATION, but did not keep the momentum going, struggling in 2016 back in Double-A.Since joining the organization, PERSON has developed into a much more viable offensive threat. He came out of the college ranks with a very bad and choppy swing, almost with a downhill swing path. He's worked since to get some usable length to his swing to allow him drive the ball through the middle of the diamond, rather than just chop at it and use his legs to get on. He'll never be a big power guy, but he should be able to drive the ball to the gaps. He runs well and is a basestealing threat and offers excellent range in the outfield. He's always taken pride in his defense and can play all three spots.PERSON missed time in 2015 with a thumb injury, but made up for it with his outstanding ORGANIZATION turn. There was hope he could use that to springboard to the top of the system, but he'll have to get past his 2016 struggles first in order to reach his ceiling of a valuable fourth-outfielder type.","label":0}

His fastball sits in the low-to-mid-90s and he's shown the ability to crank it up higher than that at times. As he matures physically and fills out his large frame, he might throw harder more consistently. He throws over-the-top and throws downhill, generating a good amount of groundball outs. His curve has potential, but it tends to be a bit on the slurvy side. He has some feel for a changeup, though it needs work. Pitchers this size often struggle with command and that's the case with PERSON, even though he does a fair job of repeating his delivery.Still a project, PERSON might eventually have the pitches and command to be a starter, though his power repertoire might be better suited for the bullpen in a ORGANIZATION kind of development path.","label":0}

He got there in 2016 and bolstered his reputation as one of the ORGANIZATION' most polished starting pitching prospects.His 6-foot-7 frame has prompted comparisons to PERSON since PERSON was in high school, but he's skinnier and more about finesse than missing bats. He has better body control than most tall pitchers, allowing him to repeat his mechanics and locate three average pitches within the strike zone. He does a good job of using his size and high three-quarters delivery to leverage his pitches down in the zone and gave up just four homers in 107 1\/3 innings during his first two years as a pro.Though PERSON lacks a plus offering, his 88-92 mph fastball plays above its velocity because he gets great extension in his delivery. His mid-70s curveball and fading changeup are reliable if not overpowering.

He has a quick right-handed swing and a mature approach, recognizing pitches well and using the entire field. Now that he's starting to get stronger and learning to pull pitches more often, he could produce 15-20 homers per season.PERSON seemed a half-step quicker in 2015, enhancing his chances of staying at shortstop.

He rose to the challenge, finishing second in the organization in batting average against, third in strikeouts and fifth in ORGANIZATION. He has pretty good stuff from the left side with a fastball that touches 93 mph. It has good sink to it, eliciting many groundball outs. He has a curve and a slider and can vary them well. He maintains good arm speed on his changeup, giving him the chance for a four-pitch mix. He'll need to cut down on his walks, but he's not far from being ready to help out the big league rotation.","label":0}

His consistent production should get him drafted in the first five rounds.PERSON employs a simple, compact left-handed swing and has good feel for the barrel. He can drive the ball from gap to gap and is willing to work counts and draw walks.

Their biggest pitching expenditure was $1.5 million to sign PERSON out of Venezuela.Five years later, PERSON has developed into a potential mid-rotation starter and one of the best lefty pitching prospects in the game. He throws his fading, sinking changeup with deceptive arm speed, and it's a legitimate plus pitch that keeps right-handers at bay. He has added velocity in 2016, boosting his fastball to a consistent 90-94 mph, and there's still projection remaining in his lanky 6-foot-5 frame.Unlike a lot of long-limbed youngsters, PERSON has no problems throwing strikes. His biggest needs are to refine his breaking ball and to prove he can handle a starter's workload, and he has made strides in both areas this season.

His ceiling is somewhat limited, that of a No. 4-type starter, but he could reach that in a hurry.The PERSON pushed ORGANIZATION up to the Class A Advanced California League to start his first full season, and he was clearly up to the challenge, earning a late May promotion to Double-A, though he landed on the disabled list with elbow soreness after just one start.","label":0}

He's knocking on the door, having reached Triple-A in 2012, though he missed considerable time with injuries. When he was on the mound, he continued to show tremendous stuff while developing a better feel for pitching. The arm strength has always been there and GPE shows a plus fastball, up to 96-97 mph. There's some sink to it as well and he gets a good amount of ground-ball outs as a result. He throws both a slider and a curve. The curve is better, especially when he stays on top it, throwing it with tight spin. The slider has a cutter action to it and both it and his changeup have the chance to be average pitches. If his command can continue to improve, he has the chance to contribute as a starter. If not, he'll definitely contribute out of the bullpen.","label":0}

He was then dealt to GPE in December as part of the ORGANIZATION' package for PERSON. While PERSON doesn't have the highest ceiling, he projects as a pitchability lefty who can make a living in the back of a big league rotation.

His terrific reads and jumps and his well above-average speed give him tremendous range. His arm lacks strength but doesn't detract from his overall brilliance in center.While his approach at the plate is too busy, PERSON does a good job of making contact and using his speed to get on base.

To do so, he'll have to curb a tendency to let his left-handed swing get too long when he tries to hit home runs.

He struck out 140 hitters in 129 innings at Double-A. He remains a fairly spotty strike-thrower, but his three-pitch mix should enable him to continue to start, though probably as a 120 or 130-inning type rather than a true workhorse, which also makes sense considering PERSON's health history. He has rare lefty starter velocity and generally sits 93-96. A 95 mph average fastball would rank third among southpaw starters in baseball, just behind PERSON and PERSON. PERSON can dump in his average curveball for strikes and his changeup has slowly turned into an average pitch, too. The cambio may yet have some developing to do as PERSON worked more heavily off his breaking ball early in his career and has lost a lot of reps due to injury.

He started tapping into his extra-base thump in 2017 before he got hurt and leveraged his swing more to clear more fences in '18. With that came more strikeouts, but that's not something the ORGANIZATION see as a huge red flag. GPE does need to work on his game plan more, as he does tend to guess at the plate too much. While he's played all three infield positions, he'll continue to see most of his playing time at second base, though he's fine at third with an arm that's bounced back to average.While still in the Minors, he'd have to play second over the hot corner in deference to the other top pick from 2015, Ke'Bryan Hayes, who was the high schooler taken between GPE and GPE. All three could impact the big league infield in '19 and beyond.","label":0}

Though he didn't look quite as explosive early the following year, PERSON played his entire junior season and led the Pac-12 in doubles before signing as a slightly over slot fourth rounder.

The hit rate is such that one of them will likely have more of a big league career than any five-game scouting look would suggest, since their abilities are often more subtle. PERSON may have the most defensive value of the group as a no-doubt shortstop, but he's also the youngest, with the shortest track record and underwhelming performance, and a limited tools-based upside due to mostly average-ish grades.

Everything clicked for him during an early-season college tournament in GPE, where PERSON worked in the mid-90s with a plus breaking ball and changeup. He generally sits 92-94, but he is lanky 6-foot-6, so it plays up a bit due to extension. He's more apt to throw his curveball for strikes rather than bury it in the dirt for swings and misses, but he showed better grasp of the latter late in the year. While PERSON will sometimes go entire outings without throwing many changeups, there have been stretches where it's his best pitch. His frame is ideal, his delivery elegant and repeatable.

He turned 20 shortly before this list went to press, so his inabiltiy to perform as an 18-year-old in full-season ball in 2017 and a 19-year-old at Hi-A in 2018 is less troublesome due to his age. When healthy, PERSON has shown bat control and above-average power on contact.

The son of former ORGANIZATION wide receiver PERSON, he signed for $1.45 million as a fourth-rounder in 2010 and established himself as one of the best prospects in baseball with a breakout season in 2012. His effort and performance were terribly disappointing the next two years, then he got back on track and made his big league debut before injuring his shoulder in 2015.PERSON has the upside of a .280 hitter with 20 homers and at least as many steals per season. He controls the strike zone better than ever but he has too much going on in his approach and has sacrificed some of his power. Though he has plus speed, PERSON has lost a step since the days when he ranked as GPE's top prospect.

The latter finally made his full-season debut in 2018, impressing enough in low Class A to earn a spot on GPE's 40-man roster.Though the ORGANIZATION didn't make PERSON a full-time starter until last season, he definitely has the attributes to stay in the rotation. His heavy sinker is a plus pitch that sits at 91-94 mph, touches 96 and helped him log a 1.5 groundout\/airout ratio in 2018. His curveball and slider have similar potential, and he also has feel for using his changeup.PERSON is doing a better job of repeating his delivery now that he has grown into his extra-large frame, showing aptitude for commanding his breaking pitches as well as his fastball. He'll still have to prove he can handle a starter's workload after missing time last year with elbow soreness. If he can hold up, he eventually could fit in the middle of GPE's rotation.","label":0}

PERSON had struggled with fastball command due to some mechanical issues and the coaches started to iron them out. He has the chance to have two plus pitches with his fastball and curve and while the changeup is behind the other two, it could be at least average.PERSON tried to do too much to justify the trade, but when he got to instructs, he hit the reset button and went to work.

PERSON has big time thump from both sides of the plate and had 26 extra-base hits in just 52 AZL games. The strikeout issues make him a low-floor prospect, but there are very few switch-hitters in the minors with this kind of playable pop, and if PERSON can hit, find a way to stay viable in center field, or both, he could be an impact regular.","label":0}

In instructional league, he ran his fastball up to 96 mph, which didn't happen often in college, and his signature hammer curveball flashed plus once again.

When a hitter like PERSON also plays up the middle defensively, teams are definitely going to sit up and pay attention.While he is a bit undersized at 5-foot-10, PERSON' performance over the summer and into his senior season had many evaluators looking past that. His speed is his best tool, an easy plus that allows him to get down the line in a hurry from both sides of the plate and be a basestealing threat. He has a contact-oriented approach and uses all fields well, and while he's not likely to be a home run threat, he could grow into his frame for more extra-base pop with an PERSON type of build. He has excellent actions and footwork at shortstop and has shown he has enough arm to stay on the left side of the infield.Assuming teams can look past his size, the one other hurdle might be his commitment to GPE. PERSON is a good student whose parents are educators, so he'll have to go early enough to bypass college, a distinct possibility.","label":0}
{"text":"GPE was thought to be the best pure high school hitter in the GPE class of 2013, and he was the third prep bat taken that June when the ORGANIZATION selected him with the 11th pick overall.

He has excellent hand-eye coordination and an advanced approach at the plate. Even when he struggled, he didn't strike out much, a trend that continued in 2015. He hasn't shown a ton of extra-base pop, but it started to show up more in his second full season. He's limited to first base but has excellent hands and range and should be an above-average defender at the position. When you're limited to first, though, there is pressure for the bat to develop and become one of the run-producing variety. The ORGANIZATION feel the power will eventually come as GPE matures and that he'll continue to move in that direction.","label":1}
{"text":"It's a good year for hard-throwing pitchers in the GPE junior college ranks, with a few who have the chance to go in the top three rounds. PERSON put up video-game type numbers at ORGANIZATION this spring, raising his Draft profile in the process, then created a huge amount of buzz by hitting triple digits consistently in a bullpen session in late May. There is no question about the quality of PERSON's fastball coming from his 6-foot-6 frame. He was consistently up to 97 mph all spring and has shown an ability to throw strikes with it as well. His secondary stuff, however, has been inconsistent. He throws both a slider and a curve, though the latter is his fourth pitch, and on some days he has two distinct, effective breaking balls. At other times, they run together, and it might serve him well to focus on just one at the next level. His changeup has improved, but it also comes and goes. There is an injury history with PERSON -- he had a screw put in his right elbow in high school -- but he's been nothing but healthy and durable in junior college. There's some debate over whether his future lies in the rotation or out of the bullpen, where his stuff would play up, but there's bound to be a team that believes he can start that will take him in the early rounds.","label":0}
{"text":" A two-sport athlete in high school, PERSON didn't begin catching until the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the third round in 2010. He's taken to his new position well and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in 2014. PERSON uses a short, balanced swing that enables him to keep his bat in the zone for a long time. While that approach doesn't lend itself much to power, he drives the gaps well and collects plenty of doubles.Defensively, PERSON has made significant strides since beginning to catch. He has a plus arm and gets rid of the ball quickly, limiting opponents' running games. His athleticism plays well behind the plate, and he has done a good job of working with the ORGANIZATION' deep stable of premium pitchers in the ORGANIZATION.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON recorded 20 saves in his first two seasons at LOCATION and dealt in the ORGANIZATION last summer, then shifted to the rotation this spring. The move couldn't have gone much better, as he ended the regular season leading ORGANIZATION Division I in GPE (0.71) and ranking second in GPE (1.25). He has high spin rates on his pitches, making him even more attractive to analytically minded clubs.While he's a 5-foot-11 right-hander without overpowering stuff, he makes up for it by mixing five pitches and three arm angles. He'll throw a four-seam fastball and a curveball from a nearly overhand slot and a two-seamer and a slider as a sidearmer, and he'll also work in a changeup and a lower-three-quarters angle. It all adds up to about a dozen combinations of pitches and slots, and he can hit 94 mph with nasty life on his fastball from down low.PERSON will have to tighten his slider at the next level, because pro hitters won't chase it as much as collegians do. He has the makings of a solid changeup too, and his feel for altering speeds and eye levels while pounding the strike zone gives him the opportunity to continue to succeed as a starter at the next level. His size will lead to durability questions -- he left one April start early and missed the next with shoulder stiffness -- and a pro team could be tempted to move him quickly as a reliever.","label":0}
{"text":"Though PERSON was a left-hander with a low-90s fastball, he made it clear he wasn't interested in a future on the mound. He also was one of the best college athletes in the 2015 Draft, so he went in the third round and signed for $581,300.PERSON has above-average speed and at least that much raw power, though he'll need to refine his skills in pro ball. His swing can get out of control at times, so there's some swing-and-miss in his offensive game. At the same time, he manages to barrel a lot of balls and draw a healthy number of walks.PERSON runs well but isn't much of a basestealer, nor is he a lock to stay in center field. Should he have to move to a corner, he has the power and arm strength to profile well in right field.","label":0}
{"text":"Before the ORGANIZATION had seven sandwich picks in 2011, they had three true first rounders. The first two picks turned into PERSON and PERSON. PERSON was pick No. 3. Signing quickly, the ORGANIZATION prepster got a lot of playing time during his summer debut. That made the ORGANIZATION confident to send the hard-working infielder to the full-season ORGANIZATION as a teenager, where he more than held his own. PERSON is quick to the ball at the plate and makes consistent hard contact. He may never be a huge power guy, but there is some extra-base ability and he can turn on the right pitch for some home run pop. He's a solid runner and has the range, hands and arm to stay at shortstop for the long-term.","label":0}
{"text":"While PERSON's GPE career began inauspiciously, with a 50-game suspension for a performance-enhancer, he's been able to make that a distant memory by making steady progress up the organizational ladder. He spent his first two summers pitching solely in relief, but when he was given the chance to start in 2016, he settled in and made it to Double-A in 2017.Though his GPE League numbers (5.28 ERA) don't look pretty, the 5-foot-11 right-hander still missed a ton of bats, leading the organization in strikeouts across the two levels he pitched in and finishing with more than 10 strikeouts per nine for the second year in a row. His low-90s fastball plays up because of its sink and run and he backs it up with a nasty slider that flashes plus and serves as a true out pitch. He has some feel for his changeup, but it has been inconsistent, as has his control. PERSON will continue to get the opportunity to start so he can keep working on his changeup and his command. If they improve, he has the chance to start in the big leagues. If not, that fastball-slider combination would surely work well back in the bullpen.","label":0}
{"text":"Developing high school catching is a tough exercise. When that catcher comes from a cold-weather area like western GPE, even more patience is needed. The ORGANIZATION initially drafted PERSON from PERSON in the fourth round of the 2013 Draft. He made it to full-season ball in 2015, but missed a large chunk of that year with a foot injury. With his bat not developing, PERSON sent PERSON to PERSON in August 2016 in return for PERSON. He was on the move again after a year with the ORGANIZATION, coming to the A's to complete the ORGANIZATION trade. Things started to click a bit in his first year with GPE and he reached Double-A for the first time, though he struggled once he arrived.A long-limbed, switch-hitting backstop, PERSON stands out more for his work behind the plate than at it. He receives well and has a strong arm that's allowed him to throw out just over 34 percent of potential basestealers heading into 2019. PERSON started to swing the bat with a bit more authority over the past two seasons and hit well in the GPE League before stumbling post-promotion. He has more of a line drive approach now, but he shows some raw power in batting practice and still has room to add strength. While it's more leverage than bat speed, you can dream on some future pop.The A's would love to see PERSON play with a little more urgency. A slow heartbeat for a catcher isn't a bad thing, but some added energy could help him reach the big leagues as a backup backstop.","label":0}

Still, he helped pitch the ORGANIZATION to their first ORGANIZATION World Series since 1992 and won their tournament opener there.PERSON has worked mostly with an 89-94 mph fastball with less consistent bite on his slider and fade on his changeup. Scouts don't care for his short-arm, drop-and-drive delivery, which hampers the effectiveness of his secondary pitches. If he doesn't turn pro this summer, he'll transfer to PERSON for 2015.","label":0}

The results were positive as he began the year in Double-A and ended it in GPE. The older brother of ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON, PERSON uses a very good two-pitch power arsenal now that he's in relief. He'll touch 98 mph with his fastball that has some sinking action to it. When he's in sync, delivery-wise, his slider can be above average. He struggled with his command during his big league debut but should get the opportunity to show he belongs full-time.","label":1}

He has the power to profile as an everyday right fielder if it does.","label":0}
{"text":"In his junior season at ORGANIZATION, PERSON's stuff backed up a bit and he saw his velocity dip. That allowed him to drop a bit from a mid-first round candidate to the Cardinals at the end of the first round. That's looking like a Draft gift for GPE, especially after watching PERSON's strong first full season of pro ball.PERSON's velocity bounced back in 2015, with his fastball sitting consistently around 94 mph and PERSON showing the ability to reach back for 96 mph when needed. He holds his velocity deep into his starts and commands his fastball to both sides of the plate well. His changeup is his best secondary offering, a pitch that has excellent sink. His biggest issue is his breaking stuff. PERSON throws a slider and a curve and depending on the day, one might be better than the other. Both have a chance to be PERSON average pitches.That's all PERSON really needs in order to reach his ceiling as a solid No. 3 type starter in the big leagues, thanks to his feel for pitching and excellent command.

There is some swing and miss to his game, but he does draw some walks and was making hard contact from the left side of the plate during his summer debut. PERSON has above-average speed, which helps him on the basepaths and in center field, where it looks like he will be able to play long-term. In an organization that has a long track record of finding college performers and helping them become productive big leaguers, it would be wrong to underestimate PERSON's upside.

His walk rate took a hit at the upper levels in 2017, though he still has a career .340 on-base percentage heading into the 2018 season. The high contact rate has come with almost no power and it doesn't appear likely that it will ever be a big part of his game.

The ORGANIZATION scooped him up as another legacy prospect in the system, but he was popped for ORGANIZATION's (ritalinic acid, a stimulant) in November and will serve a 50-game suspension to start 2019. At his best, GSP has 60 or 65-grade raw power from the left side, a plus arm that helps him fit in right field, and good enough contact skills for a 45 or 50-grade bat to allow him to get to his power.

His fastball will be in the 86-90 mph range and he'll occasionally flash an average curve and slider. His changeup is the one pitch that grades out as a tick above-average. He has been an extreme strike-thrower in his brief pro career, commanding all four pitches and keeping hitters guessing and off-balance consistently. Because none of his pitches truly stand out, there is little margin for error for ORGANIZATION. A big test will come when he gets the chance to move up to Double-A. He has the ceiling of a back-end starter, but he's had good success against left-handed hitters, so if the rotation doesn't work out, a future as a specialist out of the bullpen isn't out of the question.","label":0}
{"text":"GPE was one of the most improved players in the LOCATION last year and continued to hit with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION. His all-around game gave hm a chance to become the first position player taken in the first round out of GPE since PERSON went 15th overall in 2001, but his awful first half of his junior season at the plate has confounded scouts. He spread out too much in his stance, slowing his bat and creating holes in his swing.His offensive profile is different than that of most shortstops in that GPE's power stands out more than his hitting ability. He has an unconventional right-handed swing and an overly aggressive approach, but his bat speed and deceptive strength give him surprising pop for his size and position. He has plus speed but still is learning how to turn it into stolen bases.GPE's quick hands work well in the field. He still can smooth some things at shortstop, but he covers ground and has the solid arm to make all the necessary throws. He needs more offensive and defensive refinement than a typical college prospect but has the upside of an up-the-middle guy with 20-20 potential if he can recapture his 2018 swing.","label":0}
{"text":"In the ORGANIZATION' budget-busting 2016 international signing class, PERSON ($1.3 million) was the lesser-paid and, until close to signing day, lesser-regarded prospect when compared to PERSON ($3.9 million). PERSON looked like one of the top players in the class early, tailed off a bit, and then began improving in pro ball, whereas PERSON was a smaller kid with solid tools and advanced feel who slowly developed above average tools after GPE had locked him up at a lower price. PERSON has filled out some in the intervening time, and has sneaky raw power that may be above average at maturity. That, in combination with clearly above average bat control and enough patience that PERSON lays off pitcher's pitches, is a rare combination for an 18-year-old middle infielder. You can see why GPE pushed him to Hi-A and why he continued performing. PERSON is an above average runner and thrower but may not stick at shortstop, in which case he'll be fine at second base. There's a shot PERSON continues hitting this year, mixes in more game power, and becomes a top-50 prospect in the game, so he'll be one to monitor closely early in 2019.","label":0}

Once a wide-based, no-stride swinger, PERSON now has a big leg kick and his batted ball profile has changed dramatically between 2016 (the last, reliably large sample we had) and now. He was added to the 40-man this offseason and is a sleeper breakout candidate.","label":0}
{"text":"GPE was an intriguing projection arm in high school who flashed average stuff and had some athleticism. Then he took a big step forward in his freshman year at GSP. At his best, GPE has three pitches that flash plus at times and starter command, but most often has above average stuff and good control, consistent with a No. 4 starter look. The ORGANIZATION took him in the late first round in 2016 despite him being the bullpen\/midweek\/spot starting utility knife on a loaded staff. He was in the ORGANIZATION deal in 2018 and missed the second half of 2018 with an elbow strain, before tearing his ORGANIZATION and having PERSON during 2019 spring training.

He's been up to 94 throughout the spring, exhibiting plus arm strength that allows him to maintain velocity deep into his starts, throwing his fastball with good sink. His slider is a bit inconsistent, but when he finishes right it has the makings of an average breaking ball. His changeup is behind the other two pitches. All of it comes from a strong and athletic 6-foot-4 frame and he goes right after ORGANIZATION is committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE and it is believed he needs to go pretty early to sign him away from that commitment.

But that's exactly what's happened with GPE, who struggled to get mound time at FACILITY as a \"traditional\" pitcher, then dropped down and found some success after transferring to PERSON, a junior college in GPE. The ORGANIZATION took note and took him in the 12th round of the 2015 Draft. He shook off a slow start to his career and an injury in 2017 to pitch well enough in the GPE League and the ORGANIZATION in 2018 to earn a spot on the 40-man roster.GPE continues to throw harder as he progresses through the ORGANIZATION system, thanks to his throwing program and tweaks he's made to his delivery. He's now 97-100 mph with his fastball, routinely hitting triple digits during his ORGANIZATION stint, coming from a very low three-quarters to sidearm slot. At times, there's some serious sink that elicits a ton of groundball outs. He's already a very uncomfortable at-bat for any right-handed hitter and he's working on tightening up his slider to be a better all-around reliever. With his delivery and arm slot, it's tough for GPE to remain consistent in his mechanics, leading to some issues with command. He focused on that during his ORGANIZATION stint and the ORGANIZATION think it will continue to improve with more reps, with the chance for GPE to be a back-end bullpen guy in the big leagues.","label":0}

PERSON has below-average power and has tallied double-digit home runs just once in his pro career.PERSON is an average defender who's cleaned up his receiving skills as he's progressed through the Minors. His athleticism shows up in blocking ability, while his average arm strength plays up thanks to his consistent footwork and quick release.

That made him available to be one of four young players PERSON sent to the ORGANIZATION in GPE's PERSON trade.PERSON is very capable of impacting the ball and making productive hard contact. His improved launch angle and swing plane have led to his increased power numbers of the last two years and point to future pop. He has been more power over hit, as he swings and misses quite a bit and his overall plate discipline regressed when he moved to Double-A in 2017, but he made some nice adjustments in his first season with the ORGANIZATION. He's also struggled against left-handed pitching for much of his career. PERSON has shown he can play all three outfield positions capably, though he does have a below-average arm.Given the left-right splits and issues with his approach, PERSON might best be suited for a fourth outfielder or platoon role at the highest level.

His low-80s slider can be inconsistent but should give him a second plus pitch down the road.

He's been throwing bullpens and is on track to return sometime in the middle of 2019. It's unclear if the drop in velocity PERSON exhibited betwixt his DL stints was due to injury or if that's just how hard he throws now. At his prospect peak in GPE, when PERSON struck out no fewer than 32% of opposing hitters over a three-season stretch, he was sitting 92-94, and touching 96. Though there's less stigma surrounding drop-and-drive deliveries now, there was concern about PERSON's fastball being liftable even at that velocity due to it's plane. At his more recent 89-91, it's more worrisome. But if the velocity comes back, PERSON will have two plus pitches in his fastball and a goofy changeup, which has weird, horizontal action. He throws a ton of strikes and has two viable breaking balls. He could be a No. 3 or 4 starter if everything comes back, but is more like a No. 5 if it doesn't.","label":1}

Now a similar scenario is unfolding this year, when PERSON has followed a banner summer in the ORGANIZATION with an up-and-down spring and may not get picked high enough as a Draft-eligible sophomore to turn pro.PERSON can show flashes of three plus pitches but doesn't produce that kind of stuff on a regular basis. He often worked with a mid-90s fastball on the GPE, but he sat in the low 90s this spring, and his heater is hittable because it lacks much life. His best secondary offering is a mid-80s changeup with fade, though he lacks feel to spin and doesn't trust his curveball.The biggest issue with PERSON is his delivery, which is long in back and short in front. It affects the quality and command of his pitches and also allows hitters to get a good look at them.

His swing is shorter than a mid-inning station identification and PERSON takes good at-bats for someone his age, so there's big ceiling on the hit tool if his timing at the plate improves.

He didn't hit as much as expected as a senior and some scouts questioned his defensive ability, competitiveness, and feel to hit, so he slipped to the second round despite flashing big power and being 17 on draft day, something that is generally really attractive to analytically-leaning clubs. PERSON performed fine in his pro debut, but broke out in his second year, crushing the GPE League at age 18 in 2018. He controlled the strike zone and hit for power while exhibiting very high exit velos for someone his age.

If the makeup has turned a corner and the hitting continues to progress, the main issue will be defensive fit. PERSON is a well below average runner who one scout described as 'athletic from the knees up,' to the point where the lack of quickness will limit him to being average defensively, but he's far from that right now.

Drafted in the second round with a pick the ORGANIZATION received from the ORGANIZATION as punishment for the hacking scandal, he signed for a below-slot $1 million.PERSON worked with a 95-96 mph fastball and peaked at 98 as a Cape reliever, and he dialed it down to 91-95 to throw more strikes as a starter during the spring. His curveball can be just as overpowering, featuring both power and depth, and he also can miss bats with his mid-80s slider. He also exhibits some feel for a changeup that could develop into another solid offering as he uses it more often.There's no question that PERSON has enough pitches to make it as a starter. Recruited as a two-way player out of high school, he has athleticism that should help his control and durability. If he can't command his pitches well enough to stick in the rotation, he has late-inning upside as a reliever.","label":1}
{"text":"After graduating high school, ORGANIZATION played basketball at ORGANIZATION II PERSON for a season, then transferred to GPE, where he re-introduced himself to baseball. He began throwing harder than he did as a prep prospect. The ORGANIZATION picked him late in the 2016 draft and ORGANIZATION's velocity has continued to climb as he has moved fairly quickly through the system, reaching Double-A and the ORGANIZATION in his second full season. He now sits 94-98 and has touched 100. He can alter the shape of his fastball to either ride or sink, and he will flash an above-average slider on occasion. He also has a well-below average changeup. With this size and small school, multi-sport athletic background, it's possible ORGANIZATION has some remaining development despite his age. He projects as a middle relief option.","label":0}
{"text":"It's easy to dismiss a player as a bust when he signs a large over-slot deal out of high school, then can't seem to establish himself in a full-season league. PERSON was the case with PERSON, the one-time GPE high school standout who hit just .224 in his first taste of the LOCATION League in 2011. While some may have given up on him, PERSON is a tireless worker and while it was a smaller sample size of 51 games, it does look like the big, strong backstop might be figuring some things out. He has the chance to be an average hitter with some power. Though he's big, he's agile and athletic behind the plate and threw out 38 percent of would-be basestealers in 2012. Progress was clearly made, whether it leads to more remains to be seen.","label":0}
{"text":" The ORGANIZATION went over slot to sign PERSON away from a football scholarship at ORGANIZATION and they likely knew it would take some time to put his considerable raw tools to consistent use on the baseball field. He showed glimpses of his power-speed potential at times and had just been moved up to Double-A in July when the ORGANIZATION sent him to the FACILITY for PERSON. He was traded again in December, when the FACILITY sent him to the D-backs as a part of the three-way deal that brought PERSON to GPE. PERSON' plate discipline has been an issue, in terms of him controlling the strike zone and becoming more efficient, but he has extra-base pop and the ability to steal bases. He turned 23 only a few days before being traded to the D-backs, so there's still time for him to turn his raw tools into production as a power-hitting corner outfielder.","label":0}
{"text":"As a sophomore, in 2013, PERSON set the ORGANIZATION record for saves, breaking the mark shared by PERSON and PERSON. He began his junior season in the bullpen but moved into the rotation in March. He excelled in his new role and was pitching his way up ORGANIZATION boards before he was sidelined by elbow inflammation.PERSON returned from his injury before the ORGANIZATION and had no more problems after the ORGANIZATION selected him in the third round. He pitched well in his professional debut, even making a late-season cameo with Double-A PERSON. At his best, PERSON throws his fastball in the mid 90s with some arm-side run. His spike curveball can climb as high as 85 mph, and he also throws a fading changeup.PERSON has the stuff to start, and the ORGANIZATION have given him the chance to remain in the rotation. Still, he'll have to prove he's durable enough for that role.","label":0}

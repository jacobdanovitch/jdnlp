{"text":"ORGANIZATION won the PERSON as college baseball's best two-way player in each of his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION after turning down the ORGANIZATION as a 34th-rounder out of high school, and he's a lock to do so again after dominating more than ever this spring. He's a potential No. 1 overall pick, though clubs are still split as to whether he'll be better as a hitter or a pitcher. The 2017 ORGANIZATION player of the year is a consensus top-10-overall choice either way, the first player regarded that highly since PERSON in 1973.ORGANIZATION usually opens games on the mound by working with a 90-94 mph fastball that loses a couple ticks of velocity by the middle innings. He could add more velo and maintain it better if he focused on pitching full-time, and his fastball command is so good that his heater is effective in the upper 80s. ORGANIZATION's curveball is a consistent plus pitch and he's working on refining a changeup that he hasn't needed much to this point in his career.ORGANIZATION's smooth left-handed swing and mature all-fields approach helped him lead the GPE college national team in hitting (.326) and on-base percentage (.434) last summer. Some evaluators consider him the best college bat in the ORGANIZATION and he's hitting for more power this year, showing the upside of a .300 hitter with 20 homers per season. His lack of speed limits him to first base, where he could become a solid defender with more work.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON was dealt before the 2018 season from GPE to GPE in the ORGANIZATION trade. He's a solid inventory pitcher that can play multiple roles and relies on his above average slider, as his velocity and other pitches all hover around average. His velo was down a bit in 2018 relative to the big jump he made in 2017 when he gained 2 ticks on his fastball. When he's 92-94, touching 96, his slider plays closer to 60; PERSON's future may be in shorter stints where that could be what he's throwing in the big leagues on a regular basis.","label":1}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about PERSON, who joined the ORGANIZATION rather than attend PERSON. He's big, athletic and projectable and he's shown glimpses of having very good stuff. His above-average fastball has some sink and gets some groundballs while both his curve and sinking changeup could be average offerings. He also throws a slider, though it's slurvy and below average. PERSON's biggest issue has been his command and control, and in some ways he took a step backwards in 2012. His youth, raw stuff and size are too much to give up on, but this will be a big year for him to get back on the right path.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON's athletic, contemporary, full-body swing makes efficient use of his little frame, and he's able to tap into in-game pull power because of it. He can also play several different positions (2B, 3B, ORGANIZATION) at varying levels of skill, and he's a solid-average runner. PERSON discussion surrounding PERSON often focused on comparing him to PERSON, both because PERSON crushed PERSON the year before and because PERSON will literally be competing with PERSON for a roster spot as an infield bench contributor. PERSON is a better, more versatile defender, but PERSON has more power. ","label":0}
{"text":"One of the best defensive catchers available in the 2011-12 international class, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $1.1 million out of GPE. He hit just .203\/.239\/.240 in five Minor League seasons as a position player, so PERSON moved him to the mound in the middle of '16. He made an emergency appearance for the ORGANIZATION last July, a move that led them to exposing PERSON to waivers last December when they needed a roster spot after trading for PERSON, and the FACILITY pounced on him.The arm strength that helped PERSON earn a seven-figure bonus and throw out 37 percent of the professional baserunners who tested him also has translated to the mound. PERSON sits at 94-97 mph with his fastball and can reach 99 mph, generating downward plane with a high three-quarters delivery that helps him compensate for a relatively undersized 6-foot-1 frame. His No. 2 pitch is a mid-80s slider that has more power than bite but keeps hitters from sitting on his heater.PERSON also will throw an occasional changeup to keep left-handers off balance, but he primarily works with his fastball and slider. While PERSON is still raw and relatively inexperienced, he has made significant progress with his control and command from his first full season on the mound to his second. He has late-inning upside and could appear in GPE in the near future.","label":1}

In the month or so leading up to the draft, PERSON's velo ticked up, and down the stretch he sat 92-94, touching 95 mph deep into starts, with an assortment of offspeed pitches that all flashed above-average. The track record of GPE arms is concerning, but PERSON seemed less beholden to the issues traditionally associated with their prospects, with some scouts considering him endearingly rebellious. \nHe throws a cutter, slider, curveball, and changeup that all flash above-average, with the slider occasionally flashing plus. He was 93-95 this spring, so the velo uptick has held for nearly a year now. He's a potential No. 4 if this continues, maybe more if it's just the start of something.","label":0}

Advanced in all facets and coming off of a strong stateside debut in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was promoted all the way to GPE, where he made a single start.

{"text":"Blisters and fingernail issues were a minor problem during PERSON's 2017 pro debut, and shelved him three separate times throughout 2018. His stuff was intact when he pitched, his fastball resting mostly in the 92-94 range and topping around 96 during most of his starts, though he has peaked at 98. \nHe is mechanically non-traditional, something PERSON is able to maintain because he's such a great athlete. As his front leg kicks up before he pedals toward the plate, so too does his glove and pitching hand, way up over his head, as if his mitt and knee are connected by an invisible wire. When PERSON comes home, he drifts toward the first base side of the mound a bit, creating a unique angle on his pitches. \nAnd those pitches are good. Though he doesn't have great natural ability to spin the ball, PERSON's over-the-top arm slot enables him to get tumble on his curveball anyway, he has very advanced changeup feel, and his slider is firm. He'll be able to locate what he wants, where he wants for as long as he retains his top-of-the-scale athleticism. He may be on a bit of an innings count this year just because he only threw 66 innings in 2018, but otherwise he's quite advanced and could move through the minors fairly quickly. ","label":0}

Mitchell) and more ilkely to stay in CF than the ones scouts think will hit (ORGANIZATION, GPE, GPE). He'll be 19 on draft day and is a bit raw for a prep bat of that age but the multi-sport pedigree explains some of that away.","label":0}
{"text":"A bargain signing at $7,500 out of GPE in 2013, PERSON led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with a 1.10 ERA in 2015, his first year as a full-time starter. He opened eyes with his fastball velocity when he came to the GPE last year, and his strikeout rate (10.8) would have topped the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League if he had worked enough innings to qualify. His walk rate (6.7) would have as well, which led to high pitch counts that prevented him from working deep into games.As a starter, PERSON sits at 92-94 mph and pops some 97s with late life on his fastball. He has yet to show much aptitude for spinning the ball and is working with a slider\/cutter after using a curveball that had some depth but lacked consistency. His changeup also is in its nascent stages.PERSON' delivery features effort and he has difficulty repeating it, and his control and command require as much refinement as his secondary pitches. As a result, he likely will become a reliever in the future, with the promise of regular mid-90s velocity in shorter stints. For now, he'll remain in the rotation to give him as many innings as possible to work on his lengthy to-do list.","label":1}
{"text":"When the PERSON drafted PERSON in the eighth round out of the GPE high school ranks in 2014, he was the type of player who looked the part as a physical specimen but was considered raw in all facets of the game, given his two-sport background as an amateur. He took a major step forward in 2015, however, when he paced the ORGANIZATION York-Penn PERSON in home runs (11), ORGANIZATION (46) and ORGANIZATION (.933) in his second professional season. He began the 2016 on the disabled list while recovering from a wrist injury before finally making his full-season debut for Class A Greensboro in late April. But PERSON's time in the LOCATION PERSON turned out to be short lived, as a botched knife prank by roommate PERSON in early June resulted in a right thumb laceration and subsequent surgery.Though PERSON has long possessed impressive strength and bat speed, his stiff swing limited his production during his pro debut. The PERSON helped him clean up his mechanics last season, and it allowed him to hit for a higher average while tapping into his plus raw power more consistently. PERSON still needs to tighten his approach and improve his pitch recognition, as cutting down his strikeouts and continuing to increase his walk rate will only make him more dangerous at the plate. PERSON spent all of 2015 in center field, though it remains to be seen if he can remain there long term. He's an above-average runner with enough range to handle all three outfield spots, but with below-average arm strength, he's more likely to end up in left field if he's unable to stick up the middle. PERSON will have to show that the progress he made in 2015 can transfer to full-season ball and up the ladder, but the early signs of improvement certainly are encouraging.","label":0}

PERSON went one pick ahead of them, to the ORGANIZATION, and PERSON went with college outfielder PERSON. The ORGANIZATION were able to bring PERSON to the organization last December in the ORGANIZATION Chapman deal.Fans of PERSON are believers in his bat. Injuries, including one to his knee in 2015, have kept him off the field, but his numbers projected out over full seasons would indeed be impressive. That's particularly true of his power stats, with 82 extra-base hits in just over 200 professional games. PERSON will draw some walks and his ORGANIZATION has always been high, but his propensity for strikeouts might keep him from hitting for too high of an average. Whether PERSON can stick at third remains to be seen, however, most see a move across the diamond to first in his future.PERSON's injuries have been fluky and unrelated and the ORGANIZATION feel they may have been buying low on him. Having hit in pitching environments previously, they are confident his left-handed swing will play very well at FACILITY.","label":0}

PERSON started to get back on track in 2017 with a return to GPE and then looked like his old self after a promotion to Double-A PERSON, where he was hitting .300\/.381\/.525 when the ORGANIZATION dealt him to GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION blockbuster for PERSON Gray.One of the fastest runners in baseball, PERSON has top-of-the-scale speed and led the Minors with 82 steals in 2015 before dipping to 36 last season. He can get from the right side of the plate to first base in less than 4.0 seconds and wreak havoc once he gets on base. His quickness also should boost his on-base ability, though he'll need to tighten his plate discipline to become a quality leadoff man.While his speed gets the most attention, PERSON has a nice array of tools. His deceptive strength gives him solid raw power and he has an offensive ceiling of a .275 hitter with 15 homers per season.

His fastball sits in the low 90s and maxes out at 95 mph, playing up because of his ability to sink and command it. He has a pair of average secondary pitches in a short slider and a changeup that helps him combat left-handers.PERSON helps his cause by throwing a lot of strikes and keeping the ball down in the zone.

He has the stuff to start, with a fastball that has deception and a very good slider when his mechanics are right. He throws a changeup, though it's below-average, and if he stays in relief, he won't need it. Some don't love his arm action and worry about his durability - he did miss time with a strained lat in 2012.

He deals fastballs at 92-94 mph and tops out at 97, showing the ability to get swings and misses up in the strike zone and ground outs down in the zone. His hard slider lacks consistency but has its moments, and his changeup remains a work in progress.His 6-foot-1, 190-pound frame continues to lead to questions about his durability, but PERSON continues to answer them by using his plus control to keep his pitch counts down.

{"text":"The ORGANIZATION tried to develop ORGANIZATION, who was a hard-throwing reliever at FACILITY, as a starter after taking him in the second round of the 2012 Draft, thinking it's not easy to find left-handed starters with velocity. He had settled back into a relief role in 2014, but needed PERSON surgery at the end of that season, forcing him out for all of 2015.ORGANIZATION was back and throwing well last fall, showing the ORGANIZATION enough to add him to the 40-man roster. His time as a starter helped him with his delivery and feel for pitching, potentially making him more dangerous considering how good his raw stuff is. His fastball will touch 97 mph and sit comfortably at 95 mph. He has a power 83-85 mph curveball that also misses bats. He'll mix in a changeup now and again, but it's not something he'll need in a short relief role. He doesn't have the command to be a starter, but he doesn't need to and throws enough strikes to be successful.Once ORGANIZATION gets some innings under his belt in his return, he likely won't need too much to be ready to get big league hitters out, with a chance to be a quality lefty setup man at the highest level.","label":0}

Targeting his upside in the latter role, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the fourth round in June and signed him for $367,500. The right-hander's pro debut only validated PERSON's scouting efforts, as PERSON posted a 1.79 ORGANIZATION and a 0.75 WHIP while holding hitters to a .168 average over 51 innings in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League. Advancing to Class A Bowling Green in 2018, PERSON got off to a strong start in the ORGANIZATION before undergoing season-ending PERSON surgery in June.When he's healthy, PERSON combines size and athleticism with a lightning-quick arm to generate a plus fastball that bumps 97-98 mph and sits at 93-95. His slider can be inconsistent but has the makings of at least an above-average pitch, while further strides in developing his changeup could give PERSON a third Major League-average offering at maturity.

He has a quick left-handed bat and a mature approach, hitting gap to gap while doing a nice job of recognizing pitches and refusing to chase them out of the strike zone. He shows average to solid speed and can steal an occasional base.Some scouts think PERSON has the instincts to stay in center field even though he's not a plus runner, while others think he's destined for a corner.

PERSON easily settled the argument with a superior junior season, thrusting himself into consideration as a top-five-overall pick.PERSON manages the strike zone very well and makes consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate. He doesn't strike out as much as PERSON, has an edge in bat speed and his stroke is more geared to generate power at this point. He understands that he doesn't have to sell out to hit home runs, so he doesn't.PERSON doesn't offer much when he's outside of the batter's box, however.

He pitched better when he returned to that level this year before missing more than two months with shoulder tendinitis.GPE's best pitch usually is his curveball, which features good depth. His fastball is the definition of average, sitting at 91-93 mph and topping out at 95 with ordinary life. There are games when GPE's fading changeup is his most effective offering, though there are others when he lacks confidence in it.While GPE has the requisite three pitches needed in a starter, he's still refining his control and command. He's reasonably athletic and has a sound delivery, so he should be able to do so.

He has proven to be a quality strike-thrower.Because he's not the biggest right-hander in the world and there is some effort to his delivery, some feel PERSON is destined to be a reliever long-term, where his fastball-slider combination should work well. But it's too soon to rule out the possibility of him developing into a starting option.","label":1}

But he can really go get it in center field, and could turn into a Kevin Pillar type of regular who ends up playing every day simply because of how good he is in the field. A plus-plus runner with expansive range at the position, PERSON is capable of turning would-be extra-base hits into outs, and his speed and instincts on the basepaths will make him a dynamic pinch running option if he ends up in a bench outfield role, which most teams believe to be his median outcome.

But a forearm issue slowed him early as his velocity dipped, hurting his stock considerably, though he was pitching better as the ORGANIZATION approached.At his best, GPE leans heavily on his fastball-curve combination. When he's 100 percent healthy, he'll sit around 90-92 mph with his heater. His breaking ball is a pure curveball that he throws a lot as his out pitch. It will flash plus at times, but he doesn't always land it consistently. He does have a below-average changeup, but rarely is asked to throw it. An unorthodox delivery that includes a head snap adversely impacts his command on a regular basis.Having put the forearm injury behind him helps his stock, but because of the effort in his delivery and his difficulty in finding the strike zone consistently, most see a move to the bullpen in GPE's future. In shorter stints, his two-pitch repertoire could play well and still land him in the top five rounds.","label":0}

He hit for power in a prolonged big league look but struggled badly against breaking stuff, something that may be an issue moving forward.

Though he has limited bat control, PERSON is adept at picking hittable pitchces to attack, and cut his K% down to 17% in 2018 while maintaining his above-average 11% walk rate. Defensively, PERSON projects in right field. He saw ample time in center in 2016 and 2017 but really only played in either corner last year. There's a non-zero chance he thickens substantially through his mid-20s and loses the mobility to play the outfield, but that might also mean he's grown into more power than we're projecting and fits at first base--offensively anyway.

He added a cutter in 2018 and it has become equally as devastating while reaching the low 90s.May also has a changeup, and while it's raw and gets too firm at times, he shows enough aptitude that it should become an average fourth offering. He has good body control for a young pitcher with a lanky, long-limbed frame, pounding the strike zone despite a slingy arm action. He also stands out for his mound presence and feel for pitching, which enhance his chances of becoming a No. 3 starter.","label":1}

He thrived there, typically throwing 35 to 50 pitches once every three to five days. Most of those pitches are mid-90s fastballs that play up due to big extension, while some are above-average sliders. \nOn paper, this reads like a standard two-pitch middle reliever, and for that reason, it's fair to question whether PERSON's usage might be caricaturing his velocity, and if his fastball would be this hard on back-to-back days, or if his usage would be more variable. But if this is just how PERSON is going to use him, then this is the stuff. PERSON threw 78 innings in 38 games. His four starts were some of his shortest outings. It's possible PERSON's usage has been for developmental reasons, but we tend to think he's being prepared for a fairly distinctive role.","label":0}

He also had a breakout offensive season, though 13 of his 29 home runs came in the ORGANIZATION, which, especially at age 24, should cause some skepticism as to how much it reflects true talent. PERSON does have some power and he lifts the baseball consistently, so while he doesn't have a hit\/power combination fit for profiling at any of the defensive spots he's capable of playing, he could run into some bombs in a pinch-hitting role. He's also a better runner and first base defender than is typical for his position and may contribute in those areas, as well.

However, hitting for consistent power will never be a part of his game, and he's more likely to be a source of doubles and triples. PERSON's extra-base-hit totals are also a product of the plus speed that has netted him at least 30 steals in three straight seasons.PERSON is a true middle infielder, one with quick hands and feet as well as the arm strength to make plays from either side of the bag.

He misses a ton of bats, largely with a two-pitch mix. The athletic reliever goes right after hitters with a fastball that sits in the mid-90s and often touches higher, backing it up with a breaking ball that misses a ton of bats and serves as a true out pitch.

PERSON's fastball plays down a bit because he's a short strider and throws a bit of sinker, but it often flattens out up in the zone when he overthrows, happens at his highest velocities. His slider occasionally flashes plus, but projecting a 55 pitch is more reasonable for the type of breaker he can command. PERSON's changeup is usable and his command shows flashes, but he was added to the 40-man roster this year and will start burning options now. This ticking options clock limits the time he has to develop starter traits, making a power middle reliever the most likely outcome.","label":1}

PERSON was even more impressive in the ORGANIZATION, where, as the circuit's youngest player, he pitched to a 1.04 ERA, allowing just four hits while striking out 11 in 8 2\/3 innings across nine appearances. An elbow injury limited PERSON at the outset of the 2018 season, but he returned fully healthy in mid-June and made the jump straight to Double-A two weeks later.The epitome of a power-armed reliever, PERSON owns the best fastball in GPE's system and is one of the hardest throwers in the ORGANIZATION. He offered a glimpse at that impressive velocity in the ORGANIZATION, where he consistently pumped upper-90s heat and was up to 101 mph with a fastball that showed explosive late life. His hard slider in the upper 80s gives PERSON a second dynamic offering, one that should continue to improve along with his feel for pitching. PERSON did make gains as a strike-thrower in 2017, but his high-effort delivery and issues in repeating his arm slot still leads to well-below-average control, as evidenced by his 6.7 walks-per-nine in two professional seasons.

PERSON projects to be a good all-around hitter, and he doesn't have as much swing-and-miss in his game as many power hitters.Defensively, however, PERSON is still very much a work in progress.

He does have an advanced approach at the plate, putting up good walk rates and low strikeout rates as he's progressed through the ORGANIZATION' system. Added strength has helped allay concerns that PERSON wouldn't be able to handle the bat at the highest level, and while he'll never be a home run guy, he can hit the gaps consistently for extra bases. Just an average runner, his instincts, hands and arm should allow him to play shortstop at the highest level, though some inconsistencies with his throwing led to an increasing number of errors in 2016.The ORGANIZATION believe PERSON has the goods to do just that, though there could be a middle-infield logjam in the near future. The good news is he shouldn't have any problem shifting over to second or breaking in as a utility type.","label":1}

Then the brakes got hit hard when a bulging disc in his back kept him out for all of 2017. He did return healthy to pitch across both levels of A ball in 2018.While PERSON has the raw stuff to start, and he did get a handful of chances to do so during his junior year at ORGANIZATION, his demeanor really fits well in the back end of a bullpen. He'll aggressively go right after hitters with his three-pitch mix with an ability to challenge in all areas of the strike zone. He throws his fastball up to 97 mph downhill with good late life and his tumbling changeup is at least above-average. His breaking ball has been improving and is looking more and more like a tight slider.That breaking ball will be a focus for PERSON and the ORGANIZATION think that once it clicks, he has the chance to be a true impact reliever. With his demeanor and ability to miss bats, he could be a valuable left-handed setup man when all is said and done.","label":0}

GPE returned last year to play a key swingman role as the ORGANIZATION finished second at the ORGANIZATION World Series, then he showed the best pure stuff in the ORGANIZATION during the summer.Of all the pitching prospects in the 2016 Draft, GPE may have the best chance to develop three plus offerings. His fastball can sit at 94-96 mph and reach 98, and he has maintained his velocity in the late innings of his starts. Both GPE's hard three-quarters breaking ball (which is more likely to become a slider than a curveball) and his circle changeup can be out pitches at times, helping him challenge for the LOCATION strikeout lead while fashioning a 32-inning streak without allowing an earned run this spring.All that said, GPE does come with concerns. His combination of explosive stuff and small stature draws PERSON and PERSON comparisons, but his size and his medical history lead to concerns about his durability as a starter.

He wasn't lighting up radar guns during his first full year like he did leading up to the GPE, but was in the 90-94 range with some tail to his fastball. His curveball has improved, though he can stand to tighten it up more. He has a feel for his changeup, but it's still far from consistently effective. More than anything, PERSON needs to improve his command, which will allow all of his pitches to play up.Not the biggest guy in the world, PERSON isn't projectable, though he can add some strength which could help him in the velocity department. Throwing more consistent strikes will be the key and the ORGANIZATION will be sure to be patient in helping him develop.","label":0}

He has proven to be a more than capable replacement for PERSON (the ORGANIZATION. 4 overall pick in 2017) as the lefty fronting the ORGANIZATION rotation, ending the regular season with seven consecutive quality starts. The key to his success is a pitch he says he learned via the Internet.PERSON wanted to add a cut fastball while he was on the Cape last summer, so he googled \"PERSON cutter\" and now has a solid one that is his lone above-average offering. His 89-91 mph fastball tops out at 93 and plays up a little bit with some run and sink. He also has a curveball and a changeup that he can land for strikes, and he can morph his cutter into more of a slider.PERSON's 6-foot-6 frame and three-quarters arm slot create deceptive angle that adds to the effectiveness of his modest repertoire. He helps himself by controlling all of his pitches and doing little things like fielding his position well and controlling the running game. If he can't make it as a starter at the next level, he could have a future as a reliever because he's very tough on left-handers.","label":0}

While he's not quite at that level, PERSON has shown he is the clear No. 3, raising his profile considerably with strong play early in the spring while many decision-makers were in the state during Spring Training.Even if that early helium has slowed a bit, PERSON still has a combination of skills that should interest a number of teams. PERSON and high energy, PERSON has a little PERSON to his game, both in terms of his flash and his tools. He is capable of making loud contact from the right side of the plate, though he can have trouble at times with being on time using his big leg kick. There is some swing and miss to his game, but he also has the chance to hit for a good amount of power. He has the hands and arm to stay on the left side of the infield, though many feel that he's destined to move to third because of a lack of foot speed.A team taking PERSON might want to send him out as a shortstop and let him play his way off, and he'd likely man the premium position should he go on to the ORGANIZATION of GPE.

He has a sound stroke and has made steady improvement in three years with the ORGANIZATION, but there are some questions about his ability to hit for average in pro ball. He has some swing-and-miss tendencies and struggled with wood bats against quality pitching in the ORGANIZATION last summer.PERSON is faster on the bases than he is out of the batter's box and has reached double digits in steals in each of his college seasons.

Big and strong, PERSON will show flashes with his bat and should grow into more power as he matures and gains a better knowledge of the strike zone. He was a shortstop in high school, and thats where he played in the Rookie-level PERSON during his summer debut. Many feel, however, that with his size, a move to third will be necessary in the future. He should have the defensive tools necessary to be a good third baseman, and if it comes together as the D-backs think it will, his bat would profile well there, too.","label":0}

PERSON usually throws his low-80s slider for strikes and at times it can play like a cutter, with short, glove-slide slice. He shows some feel for a changeup but doesn't need it much in a relief role.PERSON's size and arsenal suggest he might profile as a starter, and while he doesn't have a classic starter's delivery, he does repeat it well.

{"text":"PERSON pitched to mixed results as a swingman during his first two season at ORGANIZATION and didn't fare much better as a junior in 2014 after a move to bullpen. His raw stuff continued to improve throughout his college career, though, and the ORGANIZATION took notice, eventually selecting PERSON in the 14th round. After trying to gain traction as a starter early in his pro career, PERSON moved to the bullpen in 2018 and promptly took off in the new role, turning in a dominant first half with PERSON en route to his first ever Double-A promotion at age 25 in July. A big and physical right-hander, PERSON has proved to be a late-inning force with his power fastball-curveball combo. He reaches 97-98 mph with his heater and throws it with late life that makes it difficult to lift for hitters on both sides of the plate. PERSON's breaking ball is equally dynamic, thrown in the upper 80s with sharp, downer action that helps him miss bats with ease.PERSON's ability to induce whiffs with both pitches makes his below-average control a lesser issue, but there is some concern over whether hitters will continue to chase his stuff outside of the zone at higher levels.

The left-handed hitter can really impact the ball with plus raw power and good leverage. He does draw a lot of walks, but there is also a good amount of swing and miss to his game, with some evaluators concerned about his ability to hit at the next level and get to that raw power consistently. His size limits him somewhat at the hot corner, but he does have the hands and arm to potentially stay there, while others think he might need to move to first.PERSON's junior year has been enigmatic with a bit of a slow motor on the field.

He hasn't been as sharp this season, though he's still missing bats.GPE's tall, lanky frame allows him to throw on a steeper downhill plane and a wider angle than most pitchers, making him difficult to hit. His best pitch is a low-90s fastball that he can sink in the lower half or ride by hitters in the upper half.GPE will flash a true slider in the mid-80s, though it can get sweepy at times.

He pitches mostly off of his fastball and curve, both of which show flashes of being above-average offering. He can add and subtract velocity on his fastball when needed, and his breaking ball has excellent bite with deception. He is generally able to throw strikes with both.His changeup is behind, but he may not need it should he eventually move into a bullpen role, something that seems a possibility.

Big, strong and physical, he has tremendous raw power that allows him to launch balls a long way. The rest of his game is a bit raw, though he does show some feel to hit and isn't just a kid trying to pull everything out of the park. While he's not a speedster, he runs pretty well for his size.

But he returned late in the spring and showed some of the stuff that interested scouts in the first place. PERSON has a fastball that he can get up to 95 mph, though he showed more of that over the summer, and sits comfortably in the 90-92 mph range. He struggles with repeating his delivery and his arm slot, which impacts his command. PERSON's velocity would fluctuate, but he'd also show enough left in the tank to touch 93 mph late in games.

He hasn't thrown his changeup much, so that's a work in progress, though it showed decent action over the summer. He generally repeats his delivery and throws strikes.Any team interested in GPE is going to have to exhibit patience on the player development side, but knows there could be a future starting pitcher in there to unlock.

Gradually, the big right-hander has started to reach that very high ceiling, with a chance to really blossom on the prospect scene.Long and very lean when he started out, GPE has added a lot of good strength and weighs a great deal more than what is listed in his bio. That has led to more consistent velocity, sitting in the mid-90s and touching higher than that. He's also grown as a pitcher, throwing that plus heater for strikes more consistently down in the zone. He has the chance to have a very good curve and he flashed above-average breaking balls in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2015. His changeup is a distant third pitch, but there is confidence it will become a usable third option for him in time. He should be able to repeat his delivery and be a consistent strike-thrower in time.

He barrels balls easily and has a quick right-handed bat, so he might reach double digits in home runs once he gets stronger. He has average speed that plays well on the bases but won't result in many steals.Though PERSON saw more action at second base in his pro debut and third base the last two years because PERSON has so much shortstop depth, the ORGANIZATION believe he can play short.

His ORGANIZATION stint ended prematurely due to a fractured hand. Amid these injuries, ORGANIZATION has reached base at .390 career rate and climbed to Triple-A Durham.

He didn't fare as well as a GPE junior but still earned a third-round selection by ORGANIZATION in June and then had a promising debut. He spent the offseason reworking his swing and approach, and it paid immediate dividends in his first full season as he paced the Class A ORGANIZATION in most offensive categories before moving up to high Class A Dunedin in late May. Although his production slowed a bit in the pitcher-friendly PERSON, PERSON still put together a monster season, finishing with a .302\/.358\/.528 line, 25 home runs, 31 doubles and 29 steals in 129 games. PERSON's offseason adjustments were centered on him eliminating a hole in his swing, and he showed a shorter, more leveraged path to the ball in 2018, with improved feel for keeping his barrel in the zone and driving the ball to all fields. PERSON's plus raw power from the right side of the plate is for real, and he hits some of his most impressive home runs to the opposite field. PERSON does have some swing-and-miss to his game, but it's a fair trade off given his ability to hit for both average and power. PERSON's speed is only average, but he gets the most out of it on the basepaths, wisely picking his spots to steal and consistently getting good jumps.PERSON's offensive profile is only enhanced by his abilities at shortstop, where he's an above-average defender with soft hands, good range and plus arm strength. His defensive profile also fits well at third base, and PERSON appeared in 27 games at the hot corner in 2018 on top of his usual reps up the middle.

His size also creates angle and plane that make his pitches more difficult to hit, and his athleticism should allow him to make more strides once he concentrates solely on baseball.Like Samardzija at the same stage, PERSON is far from a finished product on the mound.

On the one hand, he's a switch-hitting middle infielder who has made lots of contact -- GPE is a .285 career hitter -- over six pro seasons. On the other, he has been hurt a lot -- shoulder surgery, most recently -- and may be painted into too small a defensive corner to be rosterable if he doesn't hit enough to be a regular. It's important to be mindful of prospect fatigue creeping in here, as GPE really broke out during the summer of 2014 when as a teenager, he hit a combined .323 in the ORGANIZATION and PERSON. He was sent to GPE as part of the three-way, PERSON Gregorius-headlined trade that offseason, had a bad 2015 in the ORGANIZATION, bounced back in 2016, and has basically been hurt since. \nBecause of GPE's size and lack of power, he has to keep making high-end rates of contact to profile as an everyday player.

The 6-foot-1 right-hander isn't extremely physical and while he does have some strength in his lower half, he does need to add more strength to offset worries about his durability over the course of a long pro season.

So PERSON has rare size, precocious velocity, and control, though much of the rest of the profile has room for improvement. He exhibits neither notable raw spin nor feel for locating his current breaking ball,  a low-80s slurve. There's a strong chance PERSON tries several iterations of various breaking balls during the course of his development and the one(s) he ends up with will probably look much different than what he's currently using. At this point in his development, we just care about the raw spin, a trait of limited malleability, and PERSON' is just okay. It's reasonable to hope he grows into elite velocity. The fact that he's throwing this hard at this age and at this size is encouraging, though he's less projectable than one would probably assume given his age and height. All talk of PERSON' physical progression centers around reshaping his current frame rather than just adding mass, as he's already pretty filled out. This clouds the fastball projection somewhat, but he'll probably still end up throwing really hard. There's need for significant development throughout the rest of the repertoire, and it's more likely that a portion of that happens (resulting in a back-of-the rotation or bullpen role) than it is that all of it does (resulting in stardom).

It has excellent sink and he consistently deceives hitters with it, throwing it with good arm speed. That allows his average fastball to play up and his fastball-changeup combination has allowed him to achieve plenty of success in the past. His curveball has improved, but it's going to be a Major League average breaking ball at best. He struggled with his command while dealing with his shoulder woes and he'll have to regain his feel once he gets back from elbow surgery.Though he had success out of the bullpen late in 2014 in GPE, he really profiles better as a starter, a ceiling he can show he can live up to once he returns to the mound.","label":1}

The main concern with PERSON is his slight build, which makes many scouts hesitant to project him as a 180 inning starter. Everyone agrees that PERSON is a performer who competes and throws three average to above pitches for strikes. He'll hit 96 or 97 early in games then settle at 91-94 mph, relying mostly on a curveball that has a high spin rate but grades as a 55 for most scouts.

Though his fastball plays up a little bit due to extension and occasionally has bat-missing movement, it's fairly hittable when left in the strike zone and PERSON will likely have to make frequent use of his changeup and breaking ball. It's unclear if he has two separate breaking balls or if PERSON is simply adept at subtle speed\/shape manipulation of the same pitch, but the utility of each version is different enough that we have it graded as two different pitches.

The slippery slope to platoon ORGANIZATION is in sight, so we'd like to see some higher minors performance before we adjust our projections. \nHis pro debut was strong and he'll likely spend this year at Hi- and\/or Double-A at age 22, age-appropriate for prospects, which will show us where he is on the spectrum of expected performance from PERSON to ORGANIZATION, or maybe PERSON at the very high end.","label":0}
{"text":"After being used as a starter throughout his ORGANIZATION career, ORGANIZATION moved to the bullpen upon reaching Triple-A in 2014 and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in the same role in September. After making four appearances for the FACILITY, he was nontendered in December and quickly latched on with the ORGANIZATION. While ORGANIZATION doesn't have a pitch that stands out as plus, he can mix four offerings that are all around average. He has some life on his 87-92 mph fastball and can turn it into a mid-80s cutter. He also throws a downer curveball and a fading changeup, and on any given day any of his pitches can rank at his best.ORGANIZATION has some crossfire in his delivery, which is detrimental to his command, but adds deception. He is especially difficult on left-handed hitters, a trait that serves him well in the bullpen.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON' live arm could have made him an early-round choice as a GPE high schooler in 2016 or as a Draft-eligible sophomore at ORGANIZATION State in 2018, but his commitment to the ORGANIZATION dropped him near the bottom of the Draft both times. He dominated as a freshman closer on ORGANIZATION's 2017 College World Series runner-up team before moving into the rotation the next two years to fill a need for the team. He hasn't been nearly as effective as a starter and missed time this spring with a groin injury, and most pro clubs project him as a late-inning reliever.When he finished games as a freshman, PERSON pumped his fastball into the upper 90s and backed it up with a wipeout slider in the mid 80s. As a starter, he usually operates with a 91-95 mph fastball and a solid slider in the low 80s. His 6-foot-6 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot create downhill plane and both pitches feature high spin rates, making him difficult to hit. PERSON hasn't shown much feel for a changeup and won't need it much if he shifts back into the bullpen in pro ball. He has toned down his delivery as a starter but he still throws with a lot of effort, and his arm action and fringy control are two more factors pointing to a future as a reliever. He could race to the big leagues if utilized in that role.","label":0}
{"text":"Already, PERSON's swing has changed. He was making lots of hard, low-lying contact at ORGANIZATION, but since signing he has added a subtle little bat wrap that has made a substantial difference in how he impacts the ball. He hit for much more power than was anticipated in the summer and fall, and the identifiable mechanical tweak is evidence that the change is real and not small-sample noise. PERSON makes routine plays at short and so long as scouts are okay with his funkny throwing motion, he has a chance to stay there. There are scouts who have him projected to second base or to center field. PERSON's previous swing enabled a bit of a jailbreak out of the batter's box, exaggerating his home-to-first speed. With the new swing, he's a 55 runner. PERSON's bat and likely up the middle defensive profile mean he's likely to be at least an average regular, and he could move quickly.","label":0}

In 2018, he took a big step forward. His fastball jumped 3-4 ticks and hit 101, his slider improved into an above-average pitch, and his command also improved a bit. PERSON's conditioning and delivery improved simultaneously and he's moved to the top of the heap among the relief-only arms in this system.

He has improved both his changeup and slider and both could be true weapons with a little more refinement. He doesn't have great command yet, but that should improve as he gets more comfortable with his delivery.  PERSON will be 19 for all of 2014 and, while he isn't overly physical, should be able to add enough strength to his wiry frame to eliminate any lingering fears about his durability.","label":0}

When his symptoms failed to improve last spring, the right-hander had a nerve removed from his elbow.Now fully healthy and pitching in games for the first time in two years, the 21-year-old is beginning to look like his old self. His fastball consistently has been 91-95 mph and as high 97 this season in the LOCATION, and he's throwing it with a lot of late sinking action.

Both his curve and slider can be at least average, if not better. His changeup is behind the breaking stuff, but should also be a Major League average pitch for him.PERSON can throw strikes and has terrific mound presence.

The only issue for PERSON are tweaking the mechanics of his swing. He needs to lift the ball more and have a stronger base to tap into some of his power and allow his athleticism to play. These are fixable things, he's just turned 19, he has plenty of hitting tools to surive until this point on them alone, the ORGANIZATION rave about his makeup and coachability and his athleticism would be world class in any sport. With little improvement, he's a Kevin Pillar 2-3 win type defensive specialist and his upside is a 6+ win type perennial All-Star.","label":0}

He throws his fastball consistently in the 94-97 mph range with very good sink. His low-90s cutter gives him a second above-average pitch, and his slider, a distinctly different pitch from the cutter, is also Major League-average, and he has more than enough command to succeed in one- or two-inning stints.The PERSON handled PERSON carefully coming off of the surgery, not letting him go multiple innings and staying away from back-to-back outings. The next step will be to see how he responds to those challenges. They know he has the stuff to get big league hitters out and, as a smaller lefty with power stuff, he draws the invariable PERSON comps. The only question now is when he'll get the chance to prove it.","label":1}

He's a fringy average runner, but his instincts allow that to play up on the basepaths. PERSON's real calling card is his defense, with good range and a very strong arm.While PERSON the defense to play short regularly, some scouts like him behind the plate, too, giving him some potential positional flexibility to add to his value, especially for those who question just how well the bat will play at the next level.","label":0}
{"text":"It's hard to know when things will click for a pitching prospect. PERSON bounced around to three different colleges and was a reliever at ORGANIZATION when the PERSON took him in the seventh round of the 2015 Draft. He had a lackluster debut that summer, but then a light went off in 2016. PERSON dominated in the LOCATION, and then held his own in three starts in Double-A, finishing the year in the top three in the organization in a host of pitching categories. He made it up to Triple-A in 2017 before requiring PERSON surgery in June.The PERSON felt PERSON hadn't been allowed to just go out and pitch and learn from failure during his college career. So they let him do just that and his four-pitch mix was more than up to the task. Sure, the velocity would play up out of the pen, but he would pitch at 93-94 mph and reach back for 96-97 whenever he needed it as a starter. He currently has two distinct breaking balls and both flash at least above-average at times. One night, the slider will be a plus pitch and the curve is just average; the next start it will be flipped, and PERSON goes with the pitch he has a better feel for. His changeup is a solid average pitch, with room for improvement. His command took a large step forward as well.Before the injury, PERSON had been strong and durable and looked every bit a starting pitcher. Once healthy, he'll get back to showing he can continue to do that at the upper levels.","label":0}
{"text":" It took parts of three summers for PERSON to graduate from the ORGANIZATION, but once he did, he showed why the ORGANIZATION signed him out of the ORGANIZATION by being very effective in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON sometimes pitches backwards, trusting his curve and changeup more than his fastball. He can throw both secondary pitches for strikes and they have the chance to be outstanding offerings. Theyll be even better when he pitches off of his average fastball more. His overall command is a strength and hell pitch all season at age 20, so there might be more in the tank as he matures.","label":1}

His fastball and slider are his best offerings, and there might be more in the tank with the heater as he continues to progress. PERSON has improved his fastball command considerably, and his breaking ball is much better than it was, leading to low walk totals and plenty of missed bats.

PERSON has plus speed, his carrying tool on both sides of the ball. It allows him to have enough range to stay at shortstop defensively and to be a base-stealing threat offensively. He has enough arm to play the premium position, though his best chance at being a regular might come at second baseman in the future. What kind of profile PERSON has will depend on his bat. There's no power to speak of, but if he hits he could be a speedy every day guy on the right side of the infield. At worst, there's a high probability of him becoming a valuable utilityman at the big league level.","label":1}
{"text":"Some projection-friendly traits for pitchers are: young age, size\/frame, cold-weather background (they're raw, but also fresh from limited reps). PERSON, a 6-foot-6 Minnesota high school prospect, who was 17 on his draft day, has all of these, and also missed a whole year of innings rehabbing from PERSON. And yet, still just 22, PERSON is in Double-A and on the doorstep of the big leagues. \nHis size and arm slot create tough angle on his fastball and vertical depth on his curveball. One should feel free to project on the changeup and the still-lacking fastball control into PERSON' mid-20s because of the aforementioned traits and the ORGANIZATION. So while there's a chance PERSON winds up in the bullpen (where he could be a good multi-inning option) he also has realistic No. 4 starter upside.

{"text":"Built at age 18 like PERSON was in his prime, it's likely that PERSON's promising pro debut was at least somewhat a product of physical maturity. He has above-average raw power already and generates it with a comfortable, understated swing. He's shown feel for contact in games. He's too pull-heavy at times, or at least tries to pull pitches he shouldn't, ones he should just take. So there's power, early indicators that the contact skills will be fine, and a chance to stay at third. The size\/frame means there's risk PERSON ends up at first base if he gets bigger, and also probably means we shouldn't expect much of an increase in raw power. He has a chance to be an everyday third baseman, and lots of other viable outs if he can't get there, including a corner infield platoon of some kind and a low-end first baseman. Or maybe more power comes, and he's a 50 at first.","label":0}

He improved his conditioning before the 2014 season and was outstanding in the second half while helping PERSON win the low Class A ORGANIZATION championship.PERSON has more upside than any Cubs starting pitching prospect. He operates at 92-95 mph with his fastball and could work in the mid-90s once he adds more strength. Both of his secondary pitches elicit swings and misses too, with his hard curveball more reliable than his changeup.His control and command got better last season as well, giving PERSON all the ingredients necessary to become a frontline starter. If he can build on the progress he made in the second half, he could begin to advance quickly through the Minors.","label":1}

His curveball is his best present offering, a 79-82 mph breaker with depth, and his high-three-quarters arm slot helps him stay on top of it consistently. With little effort in his delivery, he sits at 88-93 mph and touches 95 with his fastball, which features good downhill plane and some life.PERSON also demonstrates advanced feel for his tumbling changeup and isn't afraid to use it.

{"text":"PERSON PERSON' final spring training start was unremarkable. As usual, he looked like he was in control of two excellent secondary pitches much more than his mid-90s fastball. When the Low-A GPE's season began a few days later, PERSON had issues finding the strike zone and lasted just a single inning. The problem snowballed, and his' control unravelled throughout the course of the year. He walked 32 hitters in 13.2 innings at GPE, then was sent back to extended spring training for a month before he was reassigned to short-season GPE, where he walked 33 in 17.2 innings, at times throwing fastballs in the mid-80s just to try to throw a strike. This happens to athletes in various sports from time to time, but not often enough for us to have developed refined ways of helping athletes deal with it, so we just don't know if PERSON will bounce back. We do know he is very talented. He had three plus pitches at age 19. There was concern about his physical composition and release variability, though remedying one of those things might aid the other.

That opportunity will come in GPE, where PERSON was dealt in early June in the ORGANIZATION deal.PERSON' success in the ORGANIZATION has come largely from his fastball-changeup combination. He'll pitch at 92-93 mph with his fastball, sometimes reaching back for 95-96 mph, and it has some good life to it. PERSON will then throw what's best been described as a ORGANIZATION changeup, an offspeed pitch thrown at around 76 mph, with the same arm speed, causing a ton of swings and misses. Those two pitches alone, thrown with deception thanks to a funky delivery, are the reason he held PERSON hitters to a .163 batting average against through his first three summers of pro ball. PERSON throws a slider, but it's fringy and needs work.How much PERSON' breaking ball, along with his command, improves will ultimately determine his role. He has the ceiling of a setup man, with a seventh-inning role perhaps more realistic.","label":1}
{"text":"This is another reliever who, based on usage patterns, it appears is being developed for some kind of muti-inning role, perhaps to follow the opener. PERSON was acquired from GPE for PERSON, and after the ORGANIZATION had taken his early-career development slowly (PERSON was a raw college arm from GPE), the ORGANIZATION hit the gas pedal and quickly moved him to GPE in May. He thrived there, typically throwing 35 to 50 pitches once every three to five days. Most of those pitches are mid-90s fastballs that play up due to big extension, while some are above-average sliders. \nOn paper, this reads like a standard two-pitch middle reliever, and for that reason, it's fair to question whether PERSON's usage might be caricaturing his velocity, and if his fastball would be this hard on back-to-back days, or if his usage would be more variable. But if this is just how PERSON is going to use him, then this is the stuff. PERSON threw 78 innings in 38 games. His four starts were some of his shortest outings. It's possible PERSON's usage has been for developmental reasons, but we tend to think he was being prepared for a fairly distinctive role before elbow trouble sidelined him for much of 2019, before he was ultimately traded as a PTBNL in the ORGANIZATION deal..","label":0}

To profile in a rotation, he will need a better changeup than the one he has shown in the past; missing several months of action with his lat issue likely slowed that process.

Looking like he might be the total package as dual-threat catcher, the ORGANIZATION acquired PERSON with PERSON and PERSON in the August 2017 blockbuster for PERSON.

He commands his fastball well, albeit with little movement, and it sets up a plus changeup that ranked among the best in his GPE class. He used a curveball more than a slider this year, and it gives him an average third pitch.Though PERSON throws plenty of strikes and succeeded for two years in college baseball's best conference, there still are concerns about his long-term viability as a starter.

He knows the strike zone well, works at-bats into good hitter's counts and consistently gets the barrel to the ball. He has some extra-base ability with the chance to have 12-15 home run power from the left side of the plate. PERSON missed the 2014 season at ORGANIZATION with a shoulder injury that required surgery and there was some question whether his arm would play from short long term. The ORGANIZATION will continue to give time there, mostly to develop some flexibility, with the thought that he likely ends up at second base full-time in the future.PERSON hit his way to full-season ball at the end of his summer debut, a sign that his offensive profile might allow him to move quickly.

No surgery was required, and he bounced back extremely well in 2016, winning ORGANIZATION USA pitcher of the year honors and finishing second in Division I with 148 strikeouts in 111 innings. That was enough for the D-backs to take him in the third round and give him full pick value to sign.ORGANIZATION regained his fastball velocity, maintaining 91-96 mph deep into games. He throws it with terrific extension in front of his delivery, making it appear to get on hitters more quickly, with run and sink. His power curve can be a plus pitch when he stays on top of it, though it can get slurvy and he has good feel for a sinking changeup.Athletic and physical, ORGANIZATION looks the part of a starting pitcher, but there are questions about long-term durability because of his shoulder issues and the injury track record of ORGANIZATION pitchers in the past. He should have good enough command and control to remain a starter as long as he can stay healthy. He'll have to wait until 2017 to show he can handle the workload as the right-hander experienced some elbow soreness after one pro outing in 2016 and the D-backs understandably shut him down as a precaution.","label":0}

He has a solid approach and makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate, albeit without power, and he can steal some bases now and again. He's a capable defender at shortstop, though most believe he'll need to move over to second base, where his below-average arm strength is a better fit, to have the chance to be an everyday player.

He never chases out of the zone, allowing him to draw 16 more walks than times he struck out (23). He is focused more on line-drive contact than power right now, but he does have some bat speed and he should be able to learn how to turn on some balls in hitter's counts as he progresses.

This delivery appears tough to maintain, as PERSON has to contort his body to get to that slot, but he hasn't been wild since making the change. His well-rounded collection of stuff plays much better like this, and PERSON now projects as a No. 4 or 5 starter.","label":0}

The 20-year-old was given an assignment that matched his loud tools (teams who saw him work out were putting 6's and 7's on his speed, arm, and defense at short) but not his readiness, and he was bad early in the year at Low-A Dayton. He came on, statistically, at the end of the year, but didn't walk much in either phase. Latin GPE players who have spent their entire lives playing ball back home, or in GPE or GPE, sometimes struggle with the early-April chill of the ORGANIZATION when they're first assigned there; as if being 20 in a full-season league after not playing for over a year wasn't enough, PERSON may have struggled with this. 2019 should be a more representative sample statistically of what PERSON is. There's no question about his run, field or throw tools, and he was seen at a bat-first prospect early in his GPE career, so that might be in there, too.

High in 2012, but the ORGANIZATION gambled on him in the 15th round of the ORGANIZATION and lured him away from a commitment to GPE with a $426,000 bonus. The left-hander ended up needing PERSON surgery and missed the entire 2013 season, but he pitched well the following year, logging 57 innings between Rookie-level Bluefield and Class A Short PERSON. Unfortunately, injuries derailed what was supposed to be his first full campaign in 2015, when he experienced elbow soreness early in the season and was shut down in July with shoulder pain. PERSON has showed his pre-surgery stuff when healthy, highlighted by an 88-92 mph fastball that peaks at 94 and consistently plays up due to his deceptive delivery and long arms. His changeup is a plus pitch for which he's long demonstrated feel, while his breaking ball still needs more work. PERSON has cleaned up his delivery since being drafted and knows how to pound the zone with his entire arsenal. He has the ingredients to develop into a back-end starter, but, for now, it's more important that he stay healthy and gain experience.","label":1}
{"text":"GPE had been injury free since college (when he dealt with shoulder problems), until 2018, when he had hamstring issues in the spring, and biceps tendinitis later in the summer. The lost innings resulted in an ORGANIZATION stint, during which GPE was arguably the best non-Whitley pitching prospect who was a lock to start. Despite the biceps issue, his velocity was fine in the fall. GPE sits 93-96 and makes heavy use of three good secondary pitches. The horizontal action on his slider only plays away from righties, but the curveball and changeup will help mitigate some of those issues, as well as the platoon issues that may arise from GPE's lower arm slot.","label":0}
{"text":"A two-sport star in high school, PERSON's pro baseball career was in doubt for a moment when the GPE discovered a stress fracture in his back during his physical after the draft. After the issue was resolved, PERSON took things slow for a while at the GPE complex in GPE, limited to activities like ORGANIZATION while others played in actual games. The sound of the ball off his bat during those ORGANIZATION side sessions was very distracting. PERSON stayed in GPE during the spring of 2017 and was much more physical than most of his ORGANIZATION peers. PERSON had statistical success there and in the ORGANIZATION League the following spring, before finally scuffling at Hi-A. \nThough he has above-average raw power, PERSON's in-game cut is more contact-oriented, geared for contact to the opposite field and back up the middle. During instructional league, PERSON was awkwardly swinging without a stride, likely not a swing change, but perhaps an exercise that forces him to clear his hips and improve his ability to pull the ball with power. There's a non-zero chance PERSON stays in center field but it's more likely that he moves to a corner. He has the physical ability to profile as a regular there.","label":0}

He's typically employed a successful contact-oriented, line-drive approach from the left side of the plate. He did show more extra-base power in Double-A, but with that came a higher strikeout rate, though an increased walk rate offset that to a degree. He's a solid runner with good instincts and will steal a base on occasion, and is a tick above-average defensively, both in terms of his arm and overall actions at shortstop. Many have felt his range points to being a better fit at second base and while he did still primarily play short, he did see more time on the right side of the infield in 2017.Gordon will be 22 for all of the 2018 season and is knocking on the big league door.

The ORGANIZATION thought enough of him to make sure he was part of the deal that sent PERSON to GPE that offseason.One of the keys to the streak was PERSON's improved approach at the plate. Armed with a better awareness of the strike zone, he has become a more disciplined hitter, though there is still some swing-and-miss in his game. His improved on-base skills and plus speed make him an ideal fit at the top of the order.Defensively, PERSON is still learning the infield after playing mostly center field in high school, and he's seen time at shortstop, second and third with the ORGANIZATION.

He's now an 80 runner but still doesn't quite have the hands or actions for the infield; he could work his way into being a passable second baseman, but we would guess center field is where he lands. His approach is solid but not great, in part because he has above average bat control and, obviously, the speed to outrun softly-hit balls. There's enough power to hit homers to the pull side when he gets ahold of a fastball in, but not much in way of home run potential. He's gotten a little too pull-heavy in pro ball and should use more of an all-fields approach to have a shot to develop the contact skills he needs to turn into a low-end regular.","label":0}

He can reach back for something extra and touches 98-99 mph with regularity. He scrapped a curveball for a developing, and more effective, slider and he'll mix in a changeup on occasion to keep hitters honest. Especially for a power arm, PERSON does an excellent job of throwing strikes, though he was more hittable than one would expect when he made his full-season debut in 2014. Some of that could be attributed to the bandbox in GPE, and he made a big step forward as he moved up the ladder in 2015, finishing the year in Double-A, opening some eyes in the ORGANIZATION and earning a spot on the 40-man roster.Giving someone a \"future closer\" label is always dangerous, but if PERSON can continue sharpening his breaking ball to go along with his plus fastball, he has the potential to make that kind of contribution.","label":1}

PERSON's delivery is pretty rough and features quite a bit of violence about his head. This, along with his lengthy injury history, has created worries about his health, and hinders his ability to locate with precision, as he throws strikes but not always where he wants to. Perception about PERSON's health may drive GPE to move him quickly so he can reach the majors before he breaks again. His stuff appeared close to ready last year, as he worked in the mid-90s with armside movement that pairs well with his power, and a mid-80s changeup, while his lower arm slot enables his slider to play against righties.

He's more contact-oriented with modest gap power from his natural right side, while his patient approach and discerning eye stands out on both sides of the plate.PERSON' plus speed translated to 31 steals in his first full season, and he should continue to swipe bags with ease thanks to his strong on-base skills. He gets excellent jumps and has range for days in all directions in center field, with average arm strength that allows him to play all three outfield positions if needed.

PERSON continued to make strides the following year, reaching the ORGANIZATION State League, but had his entire 2017 campaign wiped out by PERSON surgery that also cost him a portion of the '18 season. After struggling as starter upon his return from a 22-month layoff, PERSON was moved to the bullpen in 2019 and immediately took to the new role, showing improved velocity and a knack for missing bats at ORGANIZATION en route to a Futures Game selection in July. As a starter, PERSON operated with a low-90s fastball and flashed a plus breaking ball. But after tacking on some muscle while recovering from surgery, he's sitting at 95-98 mph out of the 'pen and at times touching 100 mph. He's learned to be aggressive with his heater, throwing it with late life that enables him to consistently beat hitters up in the zone His changeup features a 12-13 mph demarcation in velocity off of his fastball and has emerged as his best secondary weapon post-surgery, while his mid- to upper-80s slider gives him a third Major League-caliber offering. His control has improved along with stuff, though he still has gains to make with his command.The physical strength PERSON added during his rehab process has made him a more durable pitcher, and he's had no issues working multiple innings in 2019.

It's that power the ORGANIZATION wanted when they acquired him last fall from the D-backs in return for catcher PERSON Herrmann.GPE's power comes more from strength than bat speed and he's always going to strike out a lot.

GPE runs well for someone his size, stealing 24 bases in 2015.The upper levels should be a good challenge for GPE to see if the power will keep showing up against better pitching.

After being traded once again that offseason, this time to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION deal, PERSON struggled to find consistency on both sides of the ball during back-to-back Double-A campaigns before rebounding in Triple-A en route to his Major League debut in 2018. PERSON's big raw power was once viewed as his carrying tool, but he has struggled to apply it in games since advancing to Double-A, where he's totaled 20 homers in 213 games over two full seasons. Some of that is tied to pitchers being able to exploit his aggressive approach, though he did make gains in that regard in 2017 by improving both his strikeout and walk rates. Yet, those adjustments haven't stopped evaluators from questioning the future utility of his offensive profile. PERSON's stagnation at the plate hasn't kept him from making significant strides behind it, though, and club officials were very impressed with his improved catch-and-throw skills and overall progress as a blocker and receiver in 2017, when he threw out 40 percent of attempted basestealers in the LOCATION.

On the mound, he's up to 93 mph with his fastball, a pitch that's rarely straight. He has the ingredients of a very good curveball that could eventually be a plus pitch. It all comes from a projectable body and a delivery that works, giving hope that he'll find the strike zone more consistently and have the aptitude to add an effective third pitch as he gains more experience. Many thought he'd turn into a pitcher only, especially given his size, but he's shown he uses all those moving parts well as a position player. He's a plus runner and obviously, his arm works well, and he's played both the outfield and first base. He has a whip of a swing and is very unpolished, but some evaluators can dream on him as a hitter.PERSON has as much upside as perhaps anyone in the GPE class and that's true on both sides of the ball.

The pitch has a ton of late-sinking action that plays up because of the downhill plane he creates with his 6-foot-4 frame, and the combination gives him the chance to be a big-time ground-ball artist once developed.

The right-hander's fastball typically sits at 92-95 mph with arm-side run and can reach 98, and it jumps on hitters because he hides the ball well.

After he signed for $4.2 million, his stuff regressed and he fell out of favor quickly. PERSON dealt him with PERSON and PERSON to get PERSON from the ORGANIZATION in the summer of 2016, and after parts of three seasons in GPE's system, ORGANIZATION was sent to the GPE, along with PERSON and PERSON, in the 2018 PERSON deal for PERSON. ORGANIZATION resisted incorporating some delivery changes the ORGANIZATION wanted in his first full pro season, after which his fastball dipped into the upper 80s and his secondary pitches flattened out. Since GPE allowed him to return to his college mechanics after the trade, his four-seam fastball is sitting in the low 90s and touching higher. More important has been development of ORGANIZATION's two-seamer, a pitch that he throws with late sinking action that helped him generate ground balls at a 54 percent clip in 2018. His hard slider and changeup show signs of becoming above-average offerings, though both can be inconsistent, as ORGANIZATION struggles to execute both pitches in the same outing. PERSON will wind up as a starter or reliever is unclear. Though he throws strikes with all four of his pitches, he doesn't miss as many bats as he should with his pure stuff, which could play up in shorter stints.

{"text":"After beginning his college career as a swingman at Louisiana-Lafayette, PERSON' transition to the rotation as a sophomore had mixed results. That prompted to a full-time move to the bullpen as in junior in 2017, a role in which PERSON thrived. He struck out 100 batters and yielded just 29 hits in 59 1\/3 innings to lead all Division I hurlers in both strikeouts-per-nine (15.17) and hits-per-nine (4.40). That overwhelming success earned him a 13th-round selection by the A's in June, and after signing for $110,000, PERSON continued to miss bats with ease across two levels in his pro debut. PERSON gets the most out of his two above-average pitches, missing bats inside and outside of the zone easily with each. He won't shy away from challenging hitters up in the zone with his low-90s fastball that he can also spot to both sides of the plate. His curveball is a hammer when it's on, registering in the low 80s with tight spin, and it serves as an ideal bat-missing complement to his fastball. PERSON has a strong track record as a strike-thrower, but he'll need to improve his fastball command for continued success at higher levels.Though he started seven of his 13 games during his pro debut and has pitched almost exclusively in that role with PERSON in 2018, PERSON' future is likely in the bullpen.

{"text":"Even those casually exposed to public facing prospect analysis become familiar with a few key concepts and player archetypes, and an early lesson often addresses the volatility of players like PERSON, who have several elite tools that will lead to star-level performance if they hit enough, but who also carry significant risk that they will strike out too much to matter at all. Of course, the reason each individual player has strikeout issues can vary. Some hitters have feckless, over-aggressive approaches, while others can't recognize breaking balls or have a problem with lever length and get tied up inside. PERSON's issues -- his strikeout rate has fallen between 27% and 32% each of the last three years -- appear to stem from his bat path and limited bat control. Stiff wrists cause his bat head to drag into the zone, which can cause him to be tardy on fastballs at the letters and, more frequently, flail at soft stuff dipping down and away from him. PERSON has similar issues that have yet to be remedied. \nPERSON does enough other stuff that, even if the strike outs remain an issue, he could still be a valuable big leaguer. He crushes anything down and in, has sufficient plate coverage to hit fastballs middle away, and has enough power to do damage to the opposite field. He also has good ball\/strike recognition so, again like PERSON, there should be power, walks, and up-the-middle defense. We think PERSON is likely to be an exciting but flawed everyday player, though it's not audacious to think his relative youth (he was a 20-year-old at Hi-A in 2018) and inexperience (he also missed a year of reps due to a suspension for bad paperwork) leave more room for growth than we anticipate.","label":0}

He has big, all-fields raw power, and balls he mis-hits will often still find their way to the warning track.

He's walked well over four batters per nine innings in his two years of full-season ball and even though he can maintain his stuff and might have three average or better pitches to work with, he will have to find the strike zone more consistently to remain a starter.

His 2018 post-draft showing in the ORGANIZATION was impressive from a bat-to-ball standpoint and he took great at-bats and made hard contact during instructional league, though that was all against pitching comparable to what he saw in college.

A free agent once again after the season, PERSON signed a Minor League deal with the Marlins in November.PERSON has shown flashes of promise but has never put all the pieces together, partly due to him making seven separate trips to the disabled list since the outset of his career.

He's long struggled against same-side hurlers, though, in turn limiting his utility as a potential everyday player.PERSON is average both as a runner and a defender and continues to see time at all three outfield spots, but his fringy arm strength likely is best suited for left field at the highest level.

His breaking ball has bat-missing vertical action and is hard for hitters to differentiate out of PERSON's hand, in part because his delivery causes the ball to suddenly appear out from behind his head, which some hitters struggle to adjust to.

He can get pull-happy on occasion but manages the strike zone well and should hit for a decent average.Though he has enough arm strength for third base, PERSON probably will need to find a new position.

PERSON, who signed for full pick value of just over $5 million, ended his junior season with more home runs (13) than strikeouts. He's always had that advanced approach at the plate but started showing more over-the-fence power despite playing in a pitching-friendly home park. He can drive the ball to all fields, with extra-base ability to spare. A below-average runner, PERSON is likely limited to first base, where he is a good defender with a solid arm.

He garnered All-Star honors as a reliever in the ORGANIZATION in his pro debut, posting a 1.09 ERA over 25 appearances, then opened his first full season as a member of Class A Advanced PERSON's starting rotation. GPE stands out most for his ability to execute a low- to mid-90s sinker that he used to induce groundballs at near 68-percent clip in his pro debut. That combination of velocity and heavy life makes him difficult to barrel, let alone take deep. While scouts tend to prefer his curveball to his slider, they also generally agree that the latter has room to improve. GPE rounds out his four-pitch mix with a fading changeup in the mid-80s that he throws to both sides of the plate. As a physically durable right-hander who generates a lot of weak grounders and is generally around the zone, GPE has many of the components needed to stick as a starter.

It began with him breaking PERSON's arm with an errant pitch in GPE Training, and a long-expected move to the bullpen didn't go well when it finally happened in June.As a reliever, PERSON recorded a 7.09 ERA in Double-A and an 11.42 ERA in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON stuff wasn't an issue, as he sat in the mid-90s and peaked at 99 mph with his fastball and flashed some wipeout sliders in the mid-80s. But the control and command issues that hampered his progress as a starter somehow got worse in his new role, and he gave up more walks and got hit harder than ever before.As a little guy with a lot of effort in a crossfire delivery, PERSON won't ever have pinpoint control, but he needs to add some finesse.

The best-case scenario is that he develops into an annual 30-homer hitter as a big league shortstop.

Concerns about his hit tool were impacting his ORGANIZATION stock a bit as the spring progressed.The LOCATION recruit has a busy setup at the plate and can struggle with his timing.

The injury concerns were mostly accurate, as PERSON had shoulder soreness that led into PERSON surgery in July 2017. He's back on the mound and every indication is that he'll be able to return to his prior form, when he dominated the minor leagues to the tune of 116 strikeouts to 30 walks over 18 appearances before his arm trouble.

A converted catcher, with rare straight-line speed for a backstop but the stereotypically excellent catcher makeup, GPE is still not a very good second baseman and has below average hands and clunky footwork. He has now been playing there regularly for three and a half seasons, and his development has plateaued. We still have him projected as a 45 defender at second base but also think there's an increased chance that he eventually moves to the outfield. It would be much easier for GPE to profile were he to stay at second base, where big leaguers slashed a collective .254\/.317\/.395 (good for a 93 wRC+) in 2018. The outfield corners are not so kind. Ultimately, GPE has some power and his thunderous uppercut swing is going to enable him to get to it in games, even if his contact profile is fringy. That will play everyday at second base so long as he can. Since acquiring him, the Mariners have used Shed at second, third, and in left field.

PERSON exists at the far right tail of the player population where both of these skills are concerned. He's very similar, statistically, to one-year wonder PERSON, except PERSON has better feel for contact and can actually play shortstop.

Because PERSON is already pretty big and strong (though, it's imporant to note, he's limber and athletic, not bulky and stuff) he doesn't have as much physical proejction as is typical for a hitter this age, but he does have some, as well as a strong package of offensive skills.

His fastball sits at 88-92 mph and reaches 94, standing out more for its life than its velocity. He also has aptitude for throwing a changeup and will spin a curveball to give hitters a different look.PERSON succeeds by mixing pitches and filling the strike zone.

Some of that has to do with a lack of a true defensive home, with the 21-year-old playing mostly second base and center field, though he did play shortstop in the GPE junior leagues. He has good speed, which gives him good range wherever he plays, though he understandably needs work on his reads and routes in the outfield since he lacks experience out there. Those who watched him in GPE, where he went after leaving GPE, feel he can play up the middle somewhere. PERSON's speed, along with strong instrincts, allows him to be a basestealing threat. At the plate, he has outstanding bat control and an advanced approach. He could have enough power to reach double digits in the home run department.With the investment the ORGANIZATION made, they clearly feel PERSON has the tools to be an everyday player at the big league level.

The older brother of GPE, the 12th overall pick in the 2019 Draft, he obviously couldn't maintain that pace but has ranked among the home run and walk leaders among ORGANIZATION Division I catchers all spring. A club that believes in his ability to remain behind the plate could take him as early as the fourth round.Before his breakout, PERSON showed the ability to make consistent contact to all fields with a repeatable right-handed swing during two solid summers in the ORGANIZATION. He has gotten stronger and is making a more concerted effort to pull and drive the ball as a junior. He also has shown increased plate discipline as opponents have tried to pitch around him more often.Groshan's biggest backers note his work ethic and are confident he can become at least an adequate receiver once he improves his concentration, though other scouts are more skeptical. His arm plays as average and could tick up with a quicker release and better accuracy. A decent athlete for a catcher, he has below-average speed but isn't a clogger and has experience on the infield and outfield corners.","label":0}

PERSON started throwing harder in 2018 and remains a projectable, athletic 20-year-old with a great arm action and some changeup feel.

Badly in need of a swing change, PERSON's cut still isn't quite dialed in and he's struggling to make contact at Hi-A. He's a high-risk, high-variance prospect, the kind who might have a 4 WAR season in him because of the power and speed, but not be playable at other times. 2019 is a big year for PERSON and his stock, and it is off to an inauspicious start.","label":0}
{"text":"Taken in the middle of the first round as perhaps the most advanced college bat in the 2016 Draft class, GPE was believed to be the type of hitter who could move quickly through the system. That was especially true since he was immediately moved from behind the plate, where he played at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, to first base. He did make his way to Double-A in his first full season and capped things off with a stint in the ORGANIZATION League.GPE utilizes an advanced approach at the plate to see a lot of pitches and draw walks, leading to a system-best 77 free passes in his first full season and a .375 on-base percentage. That, combined with a contact-oriented philosophy, should allow him to hit for a high average, and it was encouraging that he performed better in that category after his move up to Double-A in 2017. There are concerns that GPE won't have the power to fit the first base profile, but there is more pop for him to tap into and he sees value in knocking out 30 doubles annually while trying to get on base at a 40 percent clip, a pace he was keeping up in GPE has continued to work on his defense at his new position, something he prioritized in 2017, and he should be capable there.

It's clear that PERSON can simply flat-out hit with a good approach at the plate that should allow him to hit for average and with more than a little power. While most have thought PERSON would become a permanent first baseman - he's played both corner infield spots thus far in his career - the A's are committed to letting him keep playing third for the time being.

PERSON has plus bat speed that should allow him to hit for a ton of power and average, especially if he can refine his approach and gain better plate discipline. Many were ready to move PERSON to third right away, but he showed some ability at shortstop, with a very good arm and good hands.

He was more consistent at the plate last season, though he missed time with a nagging quad injury.GPE has smoothed out his swing and improved his pitch recognition, and he cut his strikeout rate from 38 percent in 2013 to 25 percent in 2014. PERSON will always come as part of the package, but he can hit for at least a decent average with plenty of power. His raw power and speed are easy plus tools, and he has the upside of a 30-30 player if he can continue to refine his hitting and basestealing skills.GPE is an exciting defender as well.

Though his fastball plays up a little bit due to extension and occasionally has bat-missing movement, it's fairly hittable when left in the strike zone and PERSON will likely have to make frequent use of his changeup and breaking ball. It's unclear if he has two separate breaking balls or if PERSON is simply adept at subtle speed\/shape manipulation of the same pitch, but the utility of each version is different enough that we have it graded as two different pitches.

PERSON is a late-count, power-focused hitter, so his approach will come with some swing-and-miss and some walks. He'll need a slight adjustment to his swing plane, as it's a little too flat for this type of player (he hits more doubles when he makes hard contact than you'd like), and he may age more quickly than player with a slighter build would.

He has excellent defensive instincts, with good range and a strong arm. His swing from the left side is short and with good bat speed.

The club furthered that trend in 2019, signing GPE for $1.3 million on July 2 after the ORGANIZATION native had ranked as ORGANIZATION's No. 13 international prospect for the 2018-19 period.

The 6-foot-2 outfielder has an easy, majestic swing with well-above-average power and the ability to hit to all fields. Defensively, GPE has a chance to play center field, but he could wind up outgrowing that position and moving to a corner outfield spot. If that's the case, he still projects to be an average defender with an above-average arm in the future. GPE could lose a bit of his speed as he grows and fills out his frame, but he has strong natural instincts that would help compensate in the field.

While there are questions about his defense, PERSON was one of the top college bats in the 2017 class. He has quick, explosive hands that generate big bat speed, and he has unusual bat control for someone who swings as hard as he does.

After getting a late start in 2016, PERSON made up for the lost time with a strong showing in the LOCATION, resulting in a quick promotion to Class A Advanced Potomac.

What's more, PERSON is difficult to strike out, having fanned just 58 times in 762 career plate appearances, or once every 13.14 PAs, prior to the 2017 season. Though he's just 5-foot-8, he has some surprising power to his pull side that gives him 12-15 home-run potential, with average speed and good instincts that make him a threat on the basepaths.PERSON's below-average arm limits him to second base, where he profiles as an average defender, with good hands and solid-average range.

He returned last year to lead the Double-A PERSON in innings (156 1\/3) and strikeouts (134).Because he's a gangly 6-foot-7 lefty, he has drawn PERSON comparisons since high school, but he's skinnier than PERSON and not nearly as overpowering. PERSON did do a better job of using his lower half and leveraging his height in 2016, which helped him boost his fastball to 91-95 mph, up from 88-92 the year before. His fastball plays better than its velocity because he gets great extension in his delivery.PERSON's best secondary pitch is a solid changeup with some fade, and he also employs a curveball that has its moments and a slider that's more of a fringy offering.

PERSON still just kind of chucks his fastball and hopes it arrives near the plate, but he's going to get away with mistakes in the zone because of the velocity.

His swing has gotten a little more contact-oriented in pro ball, as was evident in his one home run and 12% strikeout rate across 175 pro games.

While PERSON has not performed statistically in either of his two full pro seasons, his sinker is back and has been very difficult for minor league hitters to lift, enabling him to generate a 66% ground ball rate during his pro career. In the ORGANIZATION, PERSON' sinker was a heavy 92-96, touching 98. His curveball is average, flashes above, and is consistently located down and to his glove side. His profile has some concerning elements: his stuff and command have been inconcsistent, his repertoire has been altered in several ways, and he missed three weeks due to injury in 18.

Tough to beat with only velocity because of how short his swing is, PERSON hit .322 for PERSON and would have won the ORGANIZATION batting title had he taken enough at-bats to qualify, but his hand was struck by a pitch in early July, ending his season. The general consensus is that PERSON may ultimately have limited value due to a lack of power, and end up either as a fourth outfielder or a regular on par with what PERSON or PERSON have been to this point, and we agree that range of outcomes is most likely.

PERSON works hard enough that scouts from opposing clubs have taken notice; his leadership qualities have been evident during two postseason runs (circumstances that are helping to drive the 'winning player' narrative here) in two pro seasons. He's a bat-first catcher with some pull power and an above-average arm. He's raw on defense and is already a sturdily built young man who may overthicken and become immobile, but based on the makeup reports it sounds like PERSON will do what is necessary to stay back there.

PERSON's stuff is exciting -- up to 97 mph, with a slider that flashes plus, and a solid average curve and changeup that flashed average -- while his arm action, athleticism, and command give him a chance to start, despite a short track record of doing so.

After three pro seasons, his strengths and weaknesses are quite similar to what they were when he turned pro.On the positive side, PERSON' combination of bat speed, strength and launch angle with his left-handed swing gives him prodigious power to all fields. He's willing to wait for a pitch he can drive and parlayed his patience into a Double-A LOCATION League-best 101 walks in 2018. He has significantly improved his game-calling since entering pro ball.PERSON' inclination to work counts and take hittable pitches also leads to strikeouts, as does his tendency to get long with his swing and become pull-conscious, resulting in a .234 batting average and a 30 percent whiff rate in his first three pro seasons. While he doesn't have to hit for a high average to be productive, it still remains to be seen if he can make it as a catcher. He lacks soft hands and is a shaky receiver, and his solid arm strength plays down because of a slow transfer and sinking action on his throws.","label":1}

A creative sequencer, PERSON's deep, unique repertoire is unlike any other pitcher in the minors. Though his fastball touches 98, his stuff is so diverse that he never has to pitch off of it. He can lob his curveball in for strikes, induce weak contact early in counts by throwing a cutter when hitters are sitting fastball, and he'll double and triple up on the changeup. What you see listed in PERSON's tool grades as a splitter is actually a screwball. It wobbles home in the 79-82 mph range, while his true changeup is usually a little harder than that. The screwgie is more than a gimmick and can miss bats, though its best in moderation because it's a little easier to identify out of his hand, and hitters are able to recognize it after seeing it multiple times in the same at-bat. PERSON's delivery is pretty violent and his TJ was not his first injury, but he's ready and has No. 2 or 3 starter stuff if it comes back after the surgery.

His arm that fired 92-mph fastballs as a high school pitcher works very well at catcher, throwing out 34 percent of would-be basestealers over his first two years behind the plate. He's a natural leader who works with pitchers and frames well. Offensively, it's been a struggle, though he started to come around in the second half of 2015, with the cavernous confines of GPE Beach not doing him any favors. He's likely never going to hit for a high average, but the raw power that enamored scouts in high school is definitely still there.Some consider PERSON to be big for a catcher, but the fact that PERSON manager PERSON fit that description as well could work in his favor.

Altogether, the toolsy outfielder led all Blue Jays farmhands in both runs scored (93) and triples (10) while finishing second in home runs (17) and third in GPE (72). PERSON' performance caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, and they acquired him and reliever PERSON for ORGANIZATION in January.Wiry and athletic, PERSON stands out as much for his remaining physical projection as he does for his present athleticism and tools. He combines bat speed with a short right-handed swing to produce lots of hard contact, generating good extension through the ball and driving it to all fields. He began to tap into his above-average raw power and cleared fences more regularly in 2017, and scouts believe there'll be more power to come once he adds strength to his lean frame and better learns to leverage his swing.

The likelihood of this is bolstered by the polished nature of PERSON's bat. His feel for the strike zone and his timing are both impressive for his age, and he is adept at attacking early-count pitches he can drive, while taking tough strikes. It helps him run deep counts and walk as well as hit for power. These traits are conducive to quick development, which means PERSON has a better chance of reaching the majors while he's still limber enough to play third for much of his first six big league seasons. \nHe could end up with a 50 bat, 60 power, high ORGANIZATION, and fine third base defense, which would make him a solid-average regular.","label":0}

That profile interested the ORGANIZATION, who acquired PERSON along with PERSON from the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON. His time with PERSON was short-lived, as he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in a Winter ORGANIZATION deal for PERSON Wilson.As a former middle infielder, PERSON brings excellent athleticism to the mound. He also brings a solid three-pitch mix. His fastball will sit at 93 mph, and he'll touch 95 mph on occasion.

More than anything, he throws a ton of strikes, proof of which comes in his career 1.8 walks-per-nine ratio heading into 2015.

Both the quality of his breaking ball and his fastball velocity vary pretty dramatically, but when they're both dialed in, PERSON can dominate without throwing a lot of strikes, mostly by bullying hitters with his heater. He is stiff, oddly postured, and may not have the necessary athleticism to repeat his delivery. The ORGANIZATION should continue developing him as a starter so he gets more reps with both his change (which got better in 2018 and has a chance to miss bats one day) and breaking ball, but we think they'll pull the ripcord eventually and let PERSON breath fire in late innings.","label":0}

During the spring, PERSON steadily worked his way up from the late first round to the third overall pick by hitting more than scouts expected a long-limbed power threat to hit. PERSON pulls this off by keeping his arms tucked in during his swing and having a flatter plane; as a result he's both quicker into the zone and in the zone longer than most power hitters. Ideally, hitters with PERSON's plus-plus power have more loft in their swing plane and extend their arms to generate the most power, with PERSON an example of a hitter with a similar frame and this more power-focused approach. We're projecting PERSON as a 50 bat with 60 game power and split the difference a bit--he could go even more extreme for power at the expense of contact--but there are a number of ways this offensive skillset could turn out, particularly with new and more progressive hitting instruction this year for the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's defense also could go a few different ways, depending how much weight he adds to his lean frame and how his lateral quickness ages. Defensively, PERSON looks major league average at times and clearly below average at others, but he'll get plenty of chances to make things work at third base.","label":0}

Elbow issues led to ulnar nerve transposition surgery in 2012, so the right-hander had thrown just 22 innings in his first two years at ORGANIZATION. This spring, he settled into a more predictable role, giving scouts a better look at his fastball-slider combination.

PERSON could very well surpass those power projections, especially after he tightened his approach and drastically reduced his chase rate during his return to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has above-average speed but has yet to show much prowess as a basestealer. He spent most of his pro debut in center field, where he projected as an average defender.

PERSON also missed most of his draft spring, but with a broken wrist. He returned not long before the draft and did not look very good, and teams had mixed opinions about him on draft day. Some thought he just needed more time to get back to full strength and speed, while others were scared off by their post-injury looks, which were so bad that multiple scouts told us they thought he may have been better off sitting out rather than giving teams a bad look just before the draft. \nAt his best, ORGANIZATION shows at least average raw power, plus speed, some feel to hit, and is a center field fit. His swing is naturally geared for opposite field contact, which will likely cap his power output unless he undergoes a swing change. That will be less necessary if ORGANIZATION stays in center field. Season-long failure to hit in the ORGANIZATION will leave us with more questions about ORGANIZATION than we had entering the year, especially if his early-season struggles with strikeouts persist.","label":0}

The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the eighth round of the 2018 Draft, signed him for $169,600 and watched him continue to dominate in his pro debut. PERSON's first full season brought similar results, as he made just six starts at ORGANIZATION A Lansing before moving up to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Dunedin.PERSON's effectiveness is routed in his invisible fastball. He throws his heater with below-average velocity, usually working at 88-92 mph, and sometimes works in the lower side of that velocity band. But the pitch plays above its velo because he's incredibly deceptive, employing long arm action on the backside and an explosive delivery that enables him to induce a ton of whiffs inside the zone. He also demonstrates feel for throwing both a mid-70s curveball and a harder slider, with the latter projection as the better secondary pitch, and he'll also mix in a changeup. PERSON doesn't fit into a neat box as a right-hander who lacks physical projection, pitches with below-average velocity and lacks a put-away secondary pitch, but there's something to be said for the effectiveness of his fastball and the sustained success he's had as a result.

That alone is enough to go on the first day if the health checks out, which GPE's does. The neutral aspect is that he's a maxed-out 6-foot-2, 200 pounds. The negative aspect is a very long arm stroke and as you might guess, a power approach rather than fine command. No prep prospect can be everything as an 18-year-old but GPE's velocity was 95-98, touching 100 this spring in early starts with lots of rest and was more 92-96 touching 97 when on normal rest. Pitchers lose velocity as they age, so many teams prefer a more conventional delivery and arm stroke, and a pitcher with average stuff and good feel who can grow into power stuff, rather than a power pitcher who has to learn feel only when his stuff declines. The recent track record of prep pitchers who hit 98-100 before the draft is riddled with injuries and command regression. With prep pitching being so subject to specific team tastes to try to avoid busts and attrition, many teams are out on GPE on Day 1 and others, particularly the more progressive clubs that value velo, spin rate, high octane stuff in shorter stints, and area control with that stuff, are interested in the 20s and 30s.","label":0}

Some scouts were still uncertain about PERSON's ultimate upside, arguing that his style of hitting indicates a swing flaw. To possess premium bat speed and face pitching in the 80s and still hit opposite field homers indicates PERSON was late on subpar stuff, and his deep hand load (which helps create the power) means this approach and his ultimate upside might not work in pro ball.

His first full season was marred by a bus accident while playing in the ORGANIZATION that forced him out of action for a few weeks, but he bounced back with a strong 2016. He was on the cusp of being big league ready when a hamate injury knocked him out for a couple of months to start 2017.PERSON has some legitimate pop in his bat from the right side of his plate when 100 percent, emanating from a whip of a swing, and should provide at least 15 homers annually. There is some swing and miss, but as his approach continues to improve, so does his overall hit tool. A third baseman when he first began his pro career, the ORGANIZATION moved him to the outfield and he's grown more comfortable, playing an athletic left field.The younger brother of ORGANIZATION prospect D.J. PERSON, PERSON is at the ORGANIZATION' highest level at age 22, waiting for his first callup. ORGANIZATION fans will be sure to love his energy and passion for playing the game.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON may already profile as a second baseman, but that hasn't kept him from standing out as an interesting high school middle-infield prospect.Strong summer performances ensured that scouts would go check out PERSON in GPE this spring, and he hasn't disappointed. The left-handed hitter can really swing the bat, showing excellent rhythm and tempo in his swing. PERSON isn't really a part of his game, but he can shoot the gaps on occasion. PERSON can really play defense, with outstanding hands and instincts. His fringy arm and lack of speed mean he can't play shortstop at the next level, but he showed over the summer just how good he can be on the right side of the infield.PERSON is the type of player who will play higher than his overall tools, and the team that sees him as that future piece of a winning puzzle will draft him and try to sign him away from his commitment to GPE.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON was part of the ORGANIZATION' 2016 pool-busting haul of players who later became free agents due to the sanctions levied against GPE. PERSON got a $1 million bonus the first time around, then another $850,000 from GPE, signing along with fellow former-Brave and PERSON. It's a cliche in scouting to call a player a 'Venezuelan-style shortstop,' but PERSON fits that to a T: smaller, without big tools, but with an advanced feel to play, and a gritty, high-effort style. He had about 30-grade raw power when he signed, and his exit velos were topping out in the mid-90s in the ORGANIZATION for GPE, but he's now hitting a quarter of his balls in play in the 90s and looks like he'll be able to avoid being so weak that pitchers can knock the bat out of his hands. PERSON is a roughly average runner with a roughly average arm, but both tools play up due to his instincts and strong internal clock, so he's a potential above average shortstop. He also has advanced feel to hit, with above average bat control and a self-aware approach at the plate. There's a road to a Jose Iglesias-type regular here, but it's more likely PERSON lands in the utility range, with maybe a season or two where he's starting quality.","label":0}

Players like this sometimes have seasons in excess of 2 WAR but are generally the type who bounce around the fringes of active rosters, like C.J. PERSON or PERSON.","label":1}
{"text":"We still know very little about PERSON compared to most 22-year-old pitching prospects. He popped up seemingly out of nowhere as a sophomore at a lesser ORGANIZATION junior college but quickly entered the first round discussion when ORGANIZATION ball kicked off in January of 2017. As the draft approached, PERSON was showing better secondary stuff in games and bumping 100 mph in bullpen sessions for scouts. He forced his way up draft boards even though teams had little history with him, and some were skeptical of the new velocity or concerned it would lead to injury. \nPERSON made seven short but dominant appearances in the LOCATION during the summer and was poised to begin 2018 at ORGANIZATION (an aggressive assignment), but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the ORGANIZATION. In his final extended spring rehab start, he was sitting 94-96 and touching 98 with the fastball. He finally toed a ORGANIZATION State League rubber that week and lasted 1.2 innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna. The injury ended his regular season after just five outs. \nAfter rest and some rehab during instructs, PERSON went to GPE for the ORGANIZATION. His stuff was electric there, his fastball always sitting 95-99 and cresting 100 mph often. He threw a 104 mph fastball and a 95 mph slider during the ORGANIZATION game, and he was able to dump his upper-70s curveball in for strikes throughout his six-week tenure, though he threw no changeups. PERSON was also horribly wild at times. It's fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of PERSON, it's impossible to know for sure. \nThere's a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen, but if he does and he breathes one-inning fire like he did during ORGANIZATION, he basically has PERSON's stuff (though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle). Provided he stays healthy, PERSON's future is bright, albeit unclear. He's likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost 2018, but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff, there is still frontline starter potential.","label":0}
{"text":" PERSON was having a bit of a breakout season in the GPE system when he was included in the package of prospects sent to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal. He struggled a bit once he joined the ORGANIZATION, though it was a relatively small sample size. There is a lot to like about PERSON, starting with an above-average fastball that comes from a relatively clean delivery, topping out in the mid 90s. He can throw it with some sink and move it in and out, but gets into trouble when he leaves it up in the zone. His curve has the chance to be an above-average breaking ball and he can use a splitter effectively as an offspeed pitch. PERSON has struggled with command over the course of his career and he had trouble throwing strikes post-trade. He'll need to refine that part of his game to be a starter, but the good news is he has the stuff to be an effective reliever if needed.","label":0}
{"text":"While at GPE (Wash.) JC, GPE underwent PERSON surgery in the fall of 2010 and missed all of 2011 and much of 2012 as a result. His arm strength returned in 2013, impressively enough for the ORGANIZATION to draft him in the fourth round. After a good start to his first full professional season, the ORGANIZATION acquired him in July as part of their return for PERSON. GPE' best pitch by far is his fastball, which sits in the low 90s, can reach 95 mph and features life as well as velocity. His secondary pitches are more works in progress, with his spike curveball showing more promise than his changeup. At 6-foot-4 and 205 pounds, GPE has the build to be a starter and has pitched well in that role after spending most of his debut as a reliever. To remain in the rotation, he'll have to throw more strikes and refine his curveball and changeup.","label":0}
{"text":"There's always been a lot to like about GPE, from his 6-foot-5 frame to his left-handedness and his fastball-slider combination. It's just that scouts hadn't been able to see much of GPE, who missed his first two years at ORGANIZATION following PERSON surgery and had been used sparingly this spring. Thrust into a huge spotlight by starting the ORGANIZATION semifinal, GPE stepped up big time with six shutout innings.If he's healthy -- and it's a big if -- GPE has solid stuff to count on. He touched 95 mph during that tourney semifinal and will regularly be up to 93 mph, with arm action and a delivery that are pretty solid. He can elicit swings and misses with his slider, but while he has a changeup, he hasn't been able to show a feel for it. He has struggled with his command, not surprising given how little he's pitched. Based on talent alone, GPE is a top several rounds talent. It might come down to whether a team's medical staff will give the go-ahead given his injury past. The team that does roll the dice could have a Draft bargain on its hands.","label":0}
{"text":"Despite pitching to mixed results during his three years at ORGANIZATION's, PERSON shot up teams' Draft boards in the spring of 2017 following a move from the bullpen to the rotation. Targeting his upside in the latter role, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the fourth round in June and signed him for $367,500. The right-hander's pro debut only validated PERSON's scouting efforts, as PERSON posted a 1.79 ORGANIZATION and a 0.75 WHIP while holding hitters to a .168 average over 51 innings in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League. Advancing to Class A Bowling Green in 2018, PERSON got off to a strong start in the ORGANIZATION before undergoing season-ending PERSON surgery in June. PERSON combines size and athleticism with a lightning-quick arm to generate a plus fastball that bumps 97-98 mph and sits at 93-95. His slider can be inconsistent but has the makings of at least an above-average pitch, while further strides in developing his changeup could give PERSON a third Major League-average offering at maturity. Meanwhile, PERSON's three-pitch mix plays up thanks to his advanced control and command and because he's adept at pitching down in the zone. Many expect PERSON, with his electric arm and promising arsenal, to serve as a valuable bullpen piece once he's fully developed. The ORGANIZATION, however, will continue to deploy him as a starter, with the goal of offering him as many innings as possible so as to further his development.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON had a breakout season in 2013, despite having to overcome a strained oblique that sidelined him for two months. As a 20-year-old at ORGANIZATION A San Jose, PERSON led all ORGANIZATION starters with 12.45 strikeouts per nine innings, and he pitched in the ORGANIZATION. He hasn't been as dominant in Double-A this year, though he has continued to pile up strikeouts.PERSON attacks hitters with his lively mid-90s fastball that reaches 98 mph. His breaking ball is a swing-and-miss pitch that looks like a hard-biting slider at its best. PERSON's changeup is still developing, but it gives him a chance for a fourth Major League average offering. He is still learning to repeat his delivery, and his command suffers as a result.PERSON earns comparisons to PERSON, and he has an excellent chance to join the ORGANIZATION' ace in the succession of homegrown pitchers to reach PERSON.","label":0}

They pushed him somewhat aggressively, sending him to full-season ball in 2011. He began 2012 at the same level before getting a midseason bump up and seemed to rise to the challenge. He didn't look overmatched during his stay in the ORGANIZATION either. PERSON has the potential to be a talented all-around shortstop, one who can make the flashy play but still needs to work on not losing focus on the routine ones. He's an aggressive swinger at the plate who needs to refine his approach at the plate in order to tap into decent power.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON showed well in GPE's rotation as a sophomore but was unable to make progress the next year, spending much of the season in the bullpen with underwhelming results. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the 23rd round that June, and he pitched at both Class A levels during his full-season debut before advancing to Double-A in 2016 and making his big league debut early in the '17 season.A physically strong right-hander, PERSON pitches with a plus fastball that sits 94-96 mph and touches 97 with late sinking action that has resulted in strong ground-ball rates throughout his career. His low-80s slider plays well against right-handed hitters thanks to its depth and tilt, at times flashing above average, though his overall consistency with the pitch leaves much to be desired. PERSON holds his own against lefties in spite of his lack of a changeup, but he may need to add the pitch to his arsenal in order to retire them at the highest level.PERSON has the ability to work more than one inning, which he did in 23 of his 48 appearances (including four starts) in 2016. That stamina could make him a long reliever in the big leagues, though he does have the potential for a greater role if he can improve his slider and fastball command.","label":0}
{"text":"There's nothing subtle about PERSON. As a freshman, he earned the nickname \"PERSON\" because of his constant energy and his full-out sprints from the bullpen to the mound. He takes the same approach on the mound, aggressively attacking hitters, and it resulted in school record for saves this spring at ORGANIZATION' stuff has kicked up a notch in his junior season. After pitching with an 88-92 mph fastball last year, he's now operating at 90-95. He also throws a tough upper-80s cutter that he can turn into a mid-80s slider with more break when he wants.PERSON also has a curveball that shows signs of turning into an average offering, though he uses it infrequently and mostly just to give batters a different look. He's not big, but he has a solid build and sound mechanics. He repeats his delivery well, enabling him to throw strikes and keep the ball down in the zone.","label":0}

PERSON fits that description, collecting a GPE ORGANIZATION title with PERSON in his first full season in the process.The 6-foot-5 right-hander passes the eye test of a future big leaguer and has made progress in his overall pitchability since signing out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE. He uses his frame well to throw downhill with his sinking fastball that can touch 94 mph at times and get those all-important groundball outs. His changeup is his best secondary pitch and it has the chance to be an out pitch. His curveball is serviceable and his slider, while below-average, gives him a fourth option to choose from. While he doesn't miss that many bats and has been a little too hittable, he also doesn't hurt himself with walks.PERSON will get the chance to see how his pitching early to contact works as he moves up the ladder.

He has explosive strength in his hands, which creates 70 raw power despite ordinary bat speed. He's a well below-average runner, but has quick feet due in part to his football background. PERSON also closed for ORGANIZATION, sitting in the low-90's on the mound. Most scouts project him at first base, but he'll get some looks at third and there's a chance he'll get a look at converting to catcher because of the arm. Those most optimistic see arm strength, a competitive mentatilty, and the short-area explosion necessary to move up the defensive spectrum from first base. There's lift in the swing and current game power skills that make up for a tendency to chase sliders off the plate.

His fastball can be plus, up to 95 mph with late life and sink. His hard slider gives him a second plus offering, a breaking ball with late bite that hes not afraid to throw at any point.

PERSON, for instance, hit under .200 his first two months of his first full year at the level in 2010. PERSON suffered the same fate in 2012 but recovered and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in 2013. While he's a fringy hitter, there's no doubting his right-handed power, notably to the opposite field.

{"text":"ORGANIZATION was barely seen the summer before his senior year in high school, pitching in the low-to-mid-80s in the lightly-scouted southwest corner of GPE, and committed to a smaller mid-major school. In his senior spring, things starting changing; he was getting into the low-90s, but it was still raw enough and abrupt enough of a change that it made sense for ORGANIZATION to go to school, now committed to GPE. He had another velo bump early in his college career, which eventually led to PERSON surgery. PERSON grew in scouting circles as his post-surgery stuff was elite and after his first start of 2018, a heavily-scouted matchup with PERSON, ORGANIZATION looked like a top five overall pick. In that game, he hit 100 mph and flashed an above average slider and changeup along with enough feel to project as a starter. From then on, things started to unravel, until the ORGANIZATION popped the local kid 31st overall. ORGANIZATION had some minor issues -- a finger injury and fluctuating velo as weather and workload dictated -- but more worrisome to scouts were both his maturity and how he fared when his fastball was more of a 6 than an 8, and his command was a 3 or 4 instead of a 5. Most college pitchers can succeed with 55 or 60 stuff and below average command, but ORGANIZATION struggled and showed it on the mound. The optimistic case is that a change of scenery, coaching, and workload (with less pressure) will help tease out that top five overall pick version of ORGANIZATION, while the pessimistic case is that what we saw down the stretch is indicative of a future as a streaky power reliever with limited feel.","label":0}
{"text":"GPE is above average to plus as a runner, defender and thrower, but scouts aren't completely sold on him offensively, projecting him as a gap-to-gap hitter with modest power.","label":0}
{"text":"GPE has some very talented athletes in its 2019 recruiting class. That's headlined by two-sport star PERSON. PERSON might not be quite on the same level as his potential classmate in terms of tool packages, but his athleticism and ability to play up the middle make the ORGANIZATION All-American an intriguing prospect in his own right, though he hadn't increased his profile in the GPE high school ranks this spring.PERSON's carrying tool is his speed, and it's close to top of the scale. The right-handed hitter has recorded some outstanding home-to-first times as well as in the 60-yard dashes that have become a staple of the showcase circuit. He has shown the ability to make solid contact in the past and there is some bat speed with the chance for him to have at least gap power as he progresses. His athleticism allows him to cover ground at shortstop and he has enough arm for the position, but not all are convinced he can stay at the premium position. There is consensus that he can stay up the middle, with many thinking he could turn into a very good center fielder. Now it will be a question of whether a team is willing to draft him early enough and pay him enough to sign him away from going to PERSON.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON was primarily a hitter in high school, and many teams didn't take him seriously as a pitcher or even see him multiple times until late in the spring. The ORGANIZATION were the team highest on him, and talked him into giving pitching a shot full-time with a well-over-slot bonus. PERSON is, as expected, still raw, but it's easy to see what ORGANIZATION scouts were so excited about: he has near-ideal body and arm action along with standout arm strength, athleticism, and ability to spin the ball. The finer points of pitching, how to mix all of his pitches, and dialing in the repetition of his delivery are still variables, all stemming from his lack of innings. He's a popular pick to be the breakout prospect in the system and has among its highest ceilings if it all comes together.","label":0}
{"text":"So young is PERSON that he had to wait almost two months after the July 2 signing day to turn 16 and become eligible to put pen to paper on his pro contract, which included a $1 million bonus. He's a typical, frame-based projection outfield prospect at a lean, high-waisted, broad-shouldered 6-foot-2. His upright swing is currently suited for high-ball contact but, based on the GPE propensity for enacting swing changes, that will likely change pretty quickly. As he grows into his body and better incorporates his lower half into his swing, he could have serious in-game power at maturity. Likely a long-term developmental project, PERSON may not be stateside for actual games until the 2020 AZL.","label":0}

He has plus raw power and has shown the wherewithal to tap into it in games at times in the past. He hasn't shown the same advanced approach he had over the summer, but the skills are there to hit for average and tap into that raw power. Relatively new to switch-hitting, his left-handed swing needs work. PERSON has a very strong arm and good hands, which gives him the chance to stick at short. His lack of speed could eventually necessitate a move to third.PERSON' summer moved him way up on GPE lists and raised the level of expectations considerably, but he didn't come out and perform as hoped this spring.

PERSON's elbow continued to bother him that fall during instructional league play -- leading to PERSON surgery that would cost him all of '16 -- while a pair of arthroscopic surgeries to address lodged tissue in the joint line in his right elbow kept him off the mound again in '17.

The big question around PERSON is his bat. He's trying to switch-hit currently, with his left side behind his right, and though he's added good weight, a lack of strength concerns some as his bat tends to trail through the zone leading to an opposite-field based approach.A lack of true defensive shortstops in this class has no doubt helped PERSON, who has reminded some of a ORGANIZATION type, shine by comparison.

He has a short stroke with a ton of bat speed. There's been a little more swing and miss to his game this spring, perhaps pressing a tiny bit trying to show how good of a hitter he is to offset any defensive concerns. Even so, he's hit for a high average and shows at least average in-game power, with the ball coming off of his bat differently than most.

When he arrived in the spring of 2018, he had added sculpted muscle mass to a prototypical frame, and his fastball was humming in at 94-97 early during spring outings. After some time in extended spring Ttaining, PERSON spent the end of last summer in Low-A as a 19-year-old, and had issues with walks. Though his delivery is devoid of violence, he struggles with release consistency and has scattershot fastball control as a result. PERSON's feel for locating his terrific curveball is often superior to his fastball command, and while this approach is becoming more acceptable in the majors, he'd ideally refine the latter. \nIt's odd to look at PERSON's numbers and argue that he took a step forward last year, but he accomplished a third of the things we hoped he'd develop -- more velocity, better command, and a better changeup or some other third offering -- before turning 20. If either of the last two components fails to progress, PERSON will end up in the bullpen. If they both do, he'll be a mid-rotation starter.","label":0}

PERSON reached base consistently, and he wreaked havoc on the bases, swiping 51 bags between PERSON and Double-A GPE. PERSON earned his Double-A promotion after playing in the ORGANIZATION Game at ORGANIZATION. His transition wasn't so smooth, however, as the swing-and-miss crept back into his game in GPE, and he batted just .179 in 43 appearances. A switch-hitter, PERSON has the potential to hit for both average and power. Before the 2018 season, he made an adjustment, allowing him to be shorter to the ball with more extension after contact. But he'll need to continue to cut down on the strikeouts. If he can add more contact to his game, he has plus-plus speed -- which translates on both sides of the ball.PERSON has a tall, athletic build that gives him the potential to do a lot of things well on the baseball field, but he still has gains to make as a hitter. A refined approach and better swing mechanics certainly have him back on track. But questions linger as to whether his game, particularly his hitting, will translate at higher levels.","label":0}

After signing, the ORGANIZATION put him in the bullpen and his velocity immediately ticked up in shorter stints, working 94-96 and hitting 99 mph.

{"text":"A two-time member of the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team during his time at GPE, PERSON's abilities in center field have never been questioned. His hitting ability, on the other hand, drew mixed reviews from scouts leading up to the 2015 Draft. The ORGANIZATION, believing in his bat, selected him in the third round, and then watched him reach Double-A in his second full season. Returning to the level in 2018, PERSON was named a ORGANIZATION midseason All-Star before an errant pitch resulted in a broken arm and effectively ended his season in late July.  PERSON impacts the baseball more consistently now after lowering his hands in his setup at the plate -- an adjustment that has been at heart of his uptick in production.

So, too, can he spot his low-90s fastball where his catcher asks for it, working up at the letters and to both corners of the plate at will.

He has gotten hammered in his return to Double-A this year, however.PERSON's fastball sat around 90 mph in high school but now runs from 92-97 mph with arm-side run and sink that should help him deal with PERSON. When he doesn't get around his low-80s slider, he shows the ability to throw it for strikes and to back-foot it against left-handers. His fading changeup slipped a little in 2017 but can be a solid pitch when he maintains his arm speed and slot when he throws it.Colorado officials compare his less-than-smooth mechanics to PERSON's, and like the three-time Cy Young Award winner in his younger days, PERSON's biggest need is consistent command. He had repeated his delivery well and thrown strikes in the past, but inconsistency with his mechanics has led to his struggles in 2018. He's still just 22, so he has plenty of time to turn things around.","label":0}

At his best, he is patient and drawing walks, which should help him hit for average with some extra-base production. PERSON's standout tool is his plus arm and he controls the running game well. Working with PERSON, PERSON also made strides in his receiving and could eventually be better than average with that and his game-calling skills.Many in the industry see PERSON as a future backup because of questions about his offensive upside.

GPE's (it's pronounced like peanut butter and ORGANIZATION ) fastball only sits in the low-90s but plays up because of extension, life, and the angle created by his height. Those traits in concert with one another make for a heater that competes for whiffs in the zone. The secondaries are closer to average, often below, though GPE can locate them.

That scout said if all three elements were together at once, it would be something like PERSON (who was a 55 or 60 PV\/FV at his peak). There's some obvious risk that PERSON's stuff plays below it's peak 2018 showings, that his command is a bit below average, and that his size limits him to multi-inning relief, in which case he's more of a 40 or 45 FV reliever who dazzles at times. He probably isn't a 180 inning starter, but PERSON will be one to watch early in 2019 to see what sort of stuff he's showing. He could be the next Phillies Latin power arm to be moved to relief who then shoots to the big leagues after PERSON, PERSON and PERSON.

And while he opened the 2018 season in Triple-A, PERSON was up in the ORGANIZATION making his debut less than a week later. After the season, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON Roark.PERSON has always had elite-level power stuff and it really played up once he was pitching in shorter stints. Going right after hitters suits him, and his fastball-slider combination led to a ridiculous 15.1 K\/9 rate in 2017. His fastball registers in the 98-100 mph range out of the bullpen, and his hard slider is a big-time swing-and-miss pitch. His changeup will never be fantastic, but he does use it against left-handed hitters on occasion. The biggest thing holding PERSON back is his command. He's walked 5.3 per nine in his career, and issued 12 walks over seven innings in eight outings with the ORGANIZATION.

He backs it up with a very advanced changeup for a teenager and a slider that's tough on right-handers, because he throws from an extreme angle.Because he's a smallish right-hander -- his listed 6-foot-2 height is charitable -- with a low arm slot and considerable effort in his delivery, some scouts worry about PERSON's ability to hold up as a starter.

He has a knack for making contact and is extremely tough to strike out. His overall approach at the plate improved, and that helped him tap into his raw power more consistently. Initially a shortstop, PERSON now splits his time between second and third base, either of which is a much better home for him, given his lack of quickness. He has good hands and a strong arm, but the lack of range might continue to be an issue. PERSON' bat is ready to contribute soon, regardless of his position.","label":1}
{"text":"A litany of off-field issues dominate every discussion about PERSON, who can't seem to get out of his own way. A fist fight with a teammate ended a college career marred by various other infractions and inconsistent physical conditioning.

He did just that in 2017, hitting a career-high 24 home runs, up from 13 the previous year, to pace all Minor League shortstops, while also posting an extra-base hit rate of nearly 55 percent. PERSON's game will always feature some swing-and-miss, and he struck out at a career-high 26 percent clip in Double-A, but the overall approach is solid.

The presence of superstar PERSON in GPE means he won't, however, and PERSON is expected to see increased reps at other positions going forward.

He's always had raw power, but didn't always look like he could tap into it consistently. Lately, however, he's shortened his swing and begun to use the whole field more effectively, showing extra-base pop to the opposite field. Much of his success stems from a more open stance which has helped him get his hips through more consistently. He's a first baseman only with well below-average speed, though his hands and footwork at the corner infield position should be adequate.

He does have solid contact skills from the right side of the plate and he should grow into some raw power. He needs to add strength and has trouble impacting the ball at times as a result, though some scouts point out that FACILITY was most heavily scouted while facing pro competition this spring. The ORGANIZATION A&M commit has close to top-of-the-scale speed, which makes him a threat on the basepaths and helps him cover a ton of ground in center field, where he should be a plus defender down the road.

PERSON's breakout campaign in college baseball's best league stood out in a thin crop of college hitters, and the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to find him still on the board in the third round. PERSON has a nice left-handed swing, shows good feel for the barrel and drives the ball across the entire field. After totaling six homers across his first two collegiate seasons, PERSON added some loft to his stroke and finally tapped into his raw power in 2017 to finish with 41 extra-base hits, including a team-high 15 home runs. An above-average runner, he moves well once underway but doesn't figure to be a stolen-base threat. Defensively, PERSON has looked comfortable at second base after previously struggling as a shortstop.

His fastball is just about average velocity-wise, thrown 88-91 mph, but it plays up because it has plus plus life and he can throw it effectively to both sides of the plate. Right-handed hitters have no chance and when his slider is effective, he can get lefties out as well.If he can continue to show he can get hitters on both sides out, he has the ceiling of a setup man.

Though horrible weather this spring delayed his senior season until mid-April, he regularly threw 92-95 once he took the mound. He generates his velocity with arm speed rather than effort and has some armside run on his heater. PERSON has decent feel for his curveball and changeup but both are works in progress because he has spent more time on his development as a position player. He threw a slider last summer, which some scouts preferred to his curve.

This type of player is getting more attention in recent years, as the same thing is happening in the draft and in the majors.

It begins with a fastball that sits in the 93-94 mph range, with the right-hander being able to reach back for more, touching as high as 97 mph. His hard slider gives him a second potential swing-and-miss pitch. His changeup is effective at times, with some splitter-like action, but it's inconsistent.

Indeed, PERSON's ground ball percent dropped nine percentage points, but the changes compromised the quality of his contact in other ways, and made it hard for him to connect with pitches in some parts of the zone at all.

He has one easily above-average pitch in his curveball, a plus breaking ball that misses bats. He also mixes in a slider, which sometimes blends in with his curve a bit too much, and he has a usable changeup, though it's his fourth pitch. He's around the strike zone with all of his pitches.With an advanced feel for four pitches as well as a bulldog mentality on the mound, PERSON shows the makings of becoming a No. 4-type starter at maturity.

As he entered ORGANIZATION play, the only time he's even been watched closely against strong pitching, PERSON wasn't good. He posted a .668 OPS with 21\/39 BB\/K ratio in 131 plate appearance. His swing flaw is tied to a toe tap he uses for timing, which has been terrible against mid-90s stuff since he stays back\/coiled so long that his stride length\/power varies swing to swing and he has no rhythm.

His fastball will now touch the mid 90s when healthy. His slider is solid average and will show flashes of being a plus out pitch. He has a very good feel for a changeup, which he is confident throwing for strikes. He commands all of his pitches well, throwing groundballs and missing bats consistently while also not hurting himself with walks. He's still an excellent athlete, one who repeats his delivery well, and he gets high marks for a mound presence that belies his years.

His power curveball is a solid average offering with the potential of being an out pitch, his changeup gives him a third usable weapon and he even has a slider to boot.

His best pitch is a sharp breaking ball that he throws with a spike grip.

Nearly two decades later, it's his son's turn, and there is little doubt the ORGANIZATION prep infielder, who is also the cousin of both PERSON and PERSON, will easily beat his dad, in terms of when he's selected.PERSON has a tremendous toolbox to work with and they were sharpening as the spring wore on. The right-handed hitter managed just a .218 average as a freshman, but has improved markedly since then, showing the ability to impact the baseball consistently. The better he's gotten at getting the barrel to the ball, the more his raw power is showing up in games, and he was clearing fences a lot more as the ORGANIZATION approached.

Already to be taken with a healthy grain of salt, ORGANIZATION numbers are often faulty when the prospect in question is more physically mature than his peers, and the hefty PERSON is a classic case. He will likely need to move to first base, perhaps even while he's still in the minors, putting a ton of pressure on his admittedly prodigious bat to fully actualize. There's not much physical projection here, so the raw power PERSON currently has is pretty close to what he'll have at peak, meaning the bat-to-ball component is what will drive his stock going forward.","label":0}
{"text":"GPE started immediately at ORGANIZATION as a freshman shortstop before making the transition to catching as sophomore a year ago. He earned all-star honors behind the plate in the ORGANIZATION last summer, leading the circuit with 72 total bases, and has upped his offensive production this spring. In a down year for catchers in the GPE, he should be one of the first selected and could climb as high as the third round.GPE has a simple swing and he recognizes pitches and controls the strike zone well, so he should hit for a decent average. Though he's not very physical, he provides some sneaky power from the right side of the plate. His above-average speed may be his best pure tool, which is rare for a catcher, and he has the instincts to steal some bases as well.Quick and athletic behind the plate, GPE still needs to polish his throwing and receiving but has the tools to be at least average in both regards. While he's strong for his size -- charitably listed at 5-foot-11 and 180 pounds -- he's small for a catcher and there's some concern about whether he'll be able to handle the workload of a long pro season. If not, he fits the utility profile because he's capable of playing almost anywhere on the diamond.","label":0}
{"text":"A ninth-round Draft pick in 2010, GPE has long looked the part of a power pitcher with his size, arm strength and natural bat-missing ability. He had struggled to find the kind of consistency necessary to maximize his impressive physical tools and achieve sustained success as a starter. A permanent move to the bullpen in the second half of 2016 sat well with the right-hander, as GPE pitched his way from Double-A up to the big leagues. He was included in the package of prospects sent to the Reds in return for PERSON in January.GPE throws a heavy fastball in the low to mid 90s, occasionally reaching back for a few extra ticks. He added a slider to his arsenal in 2015, and it's quickly emerged as his best secondary weapon, thrown with power in the upper 80s. GPE will flash an above-average curveball in the low 80s, while his changeup continues to be a work in progress, though it's not as important in a relief role.GPE's inability to repeat his delivery was largely the source of his control problems and he struggled with consistent gains in that area as a starter. He showed great strides in 2016 with his walk rate, and pinpoint command isn't a necessity should he stay in the bullpen. His fastball-breaking ball combination is ready to get big league hitters out in that kind of role right now.","label":1}
{"text":"A very divisive amateur prospect, some scouts were put off by PERSON's unique swing, while it reminded others of ORGANIZATION'. The ORGANIZATION have parlayed his natural bat control into more power. PERSON has gotten stronger and more physically mature, his lower half is better incorporated into his swing than it was in high school, and in 2017, he began lifting the ball more as his ground ball rate dropped from 42% to 34%. With that additional lift has come in-game power and PERSON has slugged well over .500 during each of the last two seasons, and hit about 25 homers during each campaign. He had a horrendous 28-game big league debut but his long track record of hitting suggests that should be heavily discounted. \nThough PERSON spent much of his minor league career in center field, he's a below average runner who is ticketed for an outfield corner, probably in right. He's an opportunistic base stealer but almost all of his value is tied to his bat, and we think he eventually ends up as a middle of the order bat with a dynamic hit\/power combination. \nThere are still detractors who don't like PERSON's motor, or his swing, but on the low end he projects somewhere in the ORGANIZATION Kepler\/Nomar Mazara area, and that still plays everyday.","label":1}

PERSON, PERSON's latest star, might get picked earlier than any of them because he's an offensively gifted catcher with plus arm strength to boot. His standout tool is his right-handed power, which he generates with bat speed and strength. He has enough feel for hitting that he could produce .280 batting averages in the ORGANIZATION. To do that, he'll need to curb a tendency for his swing that gets long at times which causes him to miss hittable fastballs. PERSON's arm gives him a third future plus tool. He moves better than most catchers, though his receiving will need to improve if he's to stick behind the plate. If not, he has enough athleticism and bat to make it as a right fielder.

Repeated hamstring injuries limited PERSON to 22 steals and 102 games in '14, though he did appear in the ORGANIZATION and reach Triple-A. He opened the 2015 season as the FACILITY' regular second baseman, but his defensive inconsistency and some baserunning mistakes resulted in his return to Triple-A in mid-May. In December, PERSON was dealt -- along with PERSON and PERSON -- to the ORGANIZATION in a three-team trade that sent PERSON from GPE to the FACILITY. PERSON has the tools to be a classic tablesetter at the top of a lineup, starting with his well-above-average speed. He has demonstrated good on-base ability with a .368 OBP in four Minor League seasons. He's stronger than most speedsters and can sting the ball into the gaps on occasion, though he also can get overly aggressive at times. Though he's quick and athletic, PERSON doesn't have the smoothest actions and footwork at second base. His hands also aren't the softest, leading some scouts to believe he could wind up in center field.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON is extremely polished for his age, in large part because he grew up around the game as the son of Dodgers scout PERSON.

Sent to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League at age 17, PERSON had a solid debut last summer, despite being one of the youngest regulars in the league.PERSON has the bat speed and already-mature approach to hit for average, and he could have double-digit home run power as he gets stronger. PERSON can get off balance at the plate from time to time, but that's a correctable flaw.While PERSON isn't as fast as he was prior to knee surgery, he still has average speed, and he knows what he's doing on the bases.

He can pitch at 93-95 mph and touch 97 with his fastball, throwing it with run and sink. He couples it with a nasty slider\/cutter, thrown in the upper-80s and with true slider break. He also has a solid curve and changeup to give him a potential four-pitch mix. The right-hander struggled with command during his first two seasons with the ORGANIZATION, but threw more strikes as a junior. Some scouts didn't love PERSON's delivery and thought he could be a future reliever. The ORGANIZATION think he has starter potential all the way and his size, stuff and durable frame all should give him every chance to fulfill those expectations.","label":1}
{"text":"The old adage goes that if you hit, you'll find a spot in the big leagues. PERSON, a non-drafted free agent from ORGANIZATION, is certainly putting that axiom to the test.Having to prove himself every step of the way, PERSON has done just that with his bat, using his ability to hit to carry him all the way to the top of the organizational ladder in the ORGANIZATION. He makes consistent contact and rarely strikes out, carrying a career .323 average in the Minors when he got called up to the big leagues for the first time in GPE. His ability to hit for average is really his lone offensive tool, as he doesn't possess over-the-fence power, and speed isn't a big part of his game. But along with his bat, he does offer positional flexibility, showing the ability to play second, short and third base capably.All of this points to a potential big league career as a utility guy. That may not sound like much, but for a player who wasn't even drafted back in 2011, it would be plenty.","label":0}

The tools are for real: plus raw power, plus arm strength, above-average bat control, speed and defense in right field and, until 2018, an unassailable record of performance. Still, corner-only hitters with approach issues -- PERSON is a free swinger with a pull-heavy approach -- run the risk of having their lack of discernment taken advantage of in the majors with little defensive value left to fall back on. After reaching GPE in 2017, 2018 was a nightmare for PERSON: he struggled out of the gate, had his approach tinkered with to try to fix things only to have it not work, then injured his ankle and needed surgery. He missed two months and continued struggling when he returned. Some rival clubs see a buy-low opportunity and would love to take a chance on PERSON' tools, but the ORGANIZATION probably aren't selling low, with the rebuilding club offering an easy road to ORGANIZATION playing time for the foreseeable future. There's big offensive talent here if PERSON can bounce back and find an approach that works in the big leagues.

Before 2018, PERSON would sit in the mid-90s, reach 97, and mix in a solid average slider, but the off-speed consistency and command weren't strong.

Hes willing to work counts and take a walk, but hes also struck out too much in the early stages of his career.

His body, even at 6-foot-7, is already maxed out and he may not grow into more velocity, but his secondary stuff and control are already fairly well in place.

After being sent out as a reliever during his pro debut, PERSON got a chance to start and ran with it, pitching his way across three levels and finishing the year in Double-A.PERSON relies heavily on a fastball-splitter-changeup trio to get hitters out. He'll throw his fastball in the low-90s with occasional life. His split-finger changeup is his out pitch, and it's a good one, thrown in the low-80s with tumble that can miss bats and get weak contact. He mixes in a breaking ball as well and has shown the ability to throw strikes, with all three pitches coming from a quick and repeatable delivery.In all likelihood, PERSON ends up back in the bullpen, where his fastball-split combination could play up.

His upright swing is currently suited for high-ball contact but, based on the GPE propensity for enacting swing changes, that will likely change pretty quickly.

He was pitched around, and unable to make as much impact contact. But all the tools remain present. PERSON has a very selective approach, letting strikes he can't drive pass him by unless he has to protect. He has a very athletic swing despite being decidedly unathletic in every other way, enabling all fields power and high rates of contact. There's no margin for error for right-handed hitting first baseman, but if there's one prospect to be confident in hitting as much as is necessary to profile at first base, it's someone with this combination of visual evaluation and statistical track record.

This spring, a bout with mono slowed him, but also may have enabled him to get back to being a better all-around hitter.When at his best, PERSON shows the ability to barrel up the baseball consistently. When he first was returning from mono, he shortened up his swing and got to more pitches. He can drive the ball and there is going to be power to tap into as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame, just so long as he doesn't get out of swing to get to it. An above-average athlete, PERSON runs decently for his size and has shown the ability to play both first base and a corner outfield spot capably, with left a likely home should a team want to try him out there.Players who can hit have the chance to get to their raw power.

Right now, PERSON has surprising contact skills for someone as lanky as he is and he's adept at identifying balls and strikes. His size and currrent swing both have significant room for growth. PERSON's bat path enters the hitting zone in such a way that it causes him to pound the ball into the ground. If that gets tweaked, and he also adds strength into his mid-20s, he might suddenly start hitting for power. This is a rare, high-variance prospect who also has a high floor.

He isnt the most selective hitter and doesnt have the loosest swing in the class, but he has some feel for the bat head and doesnt have trouble with velocity. His power and fly-ball based approach along with these issues mean he could be a 40 or 45 bat with about an average walk rate and anywhere from 50 to 60 game power.

PERSON's athleticism and quick arm help him generate easy velocity. He sits in the mid-90s with a lively fastball that he pairs with an above-average breaking ball. He misses bats with both pitches, while the crossfire in PERSON's delivery gives him natural deception and makes him especially tough on right-handed hitters. His changeup remains a work in progress, though PERSON has made strides in developing in the past year to the point where it's at least usable against left-handed hitters. His control, though still below-average, was markedly better last season as he trimmed his walk rate to 3.2 BB\/9 from 4.8 in 2017.

After things had plateaued for so long with PERSON, he seemed to be improving. Then he broke, and at an unfortunate time. PERSON in late October means PERSON, who's already relatively raw for a prospect his age, may not throw another professional pitch until mid-2020, when he's 25. We think this makes it significantly more likely that PERSON ends up in relief and while we think he could be a dominant three-pitch reliever, it has also delayed his timeline to the big leagues by perhaps two years, putting him in line to debut near the same time as similar talents who just wrapped a season in A-ball.","label":0}
{"text":"GPE, like PERSON, created quite a buzz in the ORGANIZATION during his GPE debut in 2015 with his triple-digit fastball and dominant outings. He threw well with a jump to full-season ball in 2016, but struggled when he was bumped up to the ORGANIZATION State League. A return to that level in 2017 was much better for the right-hander.GPE was 19 for all of the '16 season and he is still learning how to pitch with his high-octane stuff. At the lower levels, he could get away with just blowing it by hitters, but as he starts to get challenged more to make pitches, he'll have to set up his pitches better and have a plan of attack. He has the weapons to do so. His fastball touches 99-100 mph at times, but his slider -- which eventually should be an average breaking ball -- isn't currently good enough to keep guys off of his fastball, and he got hit more than he should. His changeup is currently his best secondary offering.GPE has much to work on in terms of his command, getting ahead in the count early and his overall pitchability, but he'll also be just 20 for all of the 2017 season, with more than enough time to figure things out.","label":1}
{"text":"Heading into the 2012 Draft, PERSON drew plenty of interest coming out of the LOCATION high school ranks. The ORGANIZATION took a shot in the 14th round and were able to sign him away from his ORGANIZATION State commitment with a well-above-slot bonus. PERSON surgery in 2014 derailed PERSON temporarily, but if his performance in '15 is any indication, the ORGANIZATION could get a solid return on their investment.PERSON's repertoire registers as average across the board, but he has a good idea of what he's doing with his three-pitch mix. He'll sit in the 90-91 mph range and can occasionally reach back for a little more, throwing his fastball with some decent movement. PERSON can spin a breaking ball -- a mid-70s curve -- and has a feel for a changeup, with both pitches having the chance to be PERSON average. He can throw strikes with all three, and while overall command has been a concern, he filled up the zone when he hit full-season Savannah in 2015.PERSON has limited ceiling, but even with the time missed, he's still very young. With his feel for pitching, he has a chance to be a back-end starting pitcher when all is said and done.","label":1}
{"text":"An elbow injury that forced him out of action at GPE in 2012 may have worked in the FACILITY's favor, as they feel they may have gotten a very good steal in PERSON. An athletic second baseman, PERSON tore up the LOCATION League and was named the All-Star Game MVP before being moved up a level during his first full season. He has been a hitting, on base, and stolen base machine during his pro career, using his plus speed to wreak havoc on the basepaths. It helps him have decent range at second as well, though the rest of his defensive game is a bit of a work in progress. His bat and his legs, though, could get him to the big leagues fairly quickly.Bernie PERSON's scouting report ","label":0}
{"text":"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON the second catcher selected in the 2013 Draft, taking him with the 21st overall pick. He stood out most for his offensive potential as an amateur, but his bat has come along slowly as a professional and now lags behind his defense. After two seasons in GPE ball, PERSON made his full-season debut at ORGANIZATION A Bowling Green in 2015. He began the 2016 season at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Charlotte and was in the midst of a breakout offensive campaign when a hand injury sent him to the disabled list in early June.Behind the plate, PERSON has made strides with his blocking and receiving. His above-average arm strength is his best defensive tool, and it helped him throw out 41 percent of would-be basestealers in the ORGANIZATION in 2015. Meanwhile, club officials praise his leadership qualities and feel for handling a staff.Offensively, PERSON employs an up-the-middle approach, and he produces good bat speed from the left side of the plate. That, plus his size and strength, give him a good chance to develop more power, though he's hit just a handful of home runs across his first four seasons. If he is to reach his offensive potential, he'll need to do a better job controlling the strike zone and trim some of the swing-and-miss from his game.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON was a projection prep arm from GPE whose price was just high enough to get him to GPE. He had a big freshman year there and then had a national coming-out party as the ace of ORGANIZATION USA that summer. PERSON continued at about that level for the next two seasons, slinging in a heavy, 91-96 mph sinker from a low slot with a deceptive, crossfire delivery. He threw strikes and had a plus slider. Scouts who weren't as enthusiastic about PERSON's changeup, or arm slot, or the length of his arm action saw a reliever. His stuff would flatten out and his command would back up as he fatigued into the late stages of some starts. The ORGANIZATION had PERSON change his delivery and arm action for the first half-dozen or so starts in 2018, focusing on a more traditional four-seam fastball approach. It didn't work, and GPE let PERSON go back to what he had been doing later in the year, and his dominant final two months of 2018 reflect his comfort with this approach. We think the likely outcome here is a multi-inning power reliever who dominates righties with strikeouts and groundballs, though some see a starter in the mold of PERSON. Either way, PERSON should move quickly, especially if he's only asked to face a lineup once or twice per outing.","label":0}
{"text":"Only six Wisconsin high schoolers were selected in the top two rounds of the first 51 Drafts, but the ORGANIZATION State may have two this year in shortstop PERSON and GPE. The latter is the best offensive catcher in the 2016 prep ranks and could be the first high school backstop picked in June.GPE has a smooth left-handed swing that generates a lot of bat speed. He's strong and barrels a lot of balls, producing power without swinging for the fences. He has the upside of a .270 hitter with 20 homers per season, though the demands of catching may knock those numbers down.GPE has work to do behind the plate, though he has the tools to make it at catcher and scouts believe he'll figure it out. The ORGANIZATION recruit has solid arm strength and makes accurate throws. He sets a good target and moves well behind the plate, though his receiving and blocking skills will have to improve.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON has extensive athletic bloodlines, though he's the first member of his family to go the baseball route. His father PERSON was the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 1978 ORGANIZATION draft, and his brother PERSON is a superstar with the ORGANIZATION State Warriors. Another brother, GPE, had a brief ORGANIZATION stint in 2012. It's easy to dream on PERSON's size and athleticism, but he has yet to take a significant step forward in seven pro seasons. His bat speed and long levers give him plenty of raw power, and he has the patience to work counts and look for a pitch he can drive. But he alternately gets pull-conscious and passive at the plate, and he swings and misses too much, averaging a strikeout every 3.85 plate appearances in his ORGANIZATION career. In the 2015 offseason, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION -- along with PERSON and PERSON -- in the three-team deal that yielded the FACILITY from GPE. PERSON has solid speed and uses it well on the bases and in the outfield. An average center fielder with an average arm, he's capable of playing all three outfield positions. If everything comes together, he could be a 20-20 center fielder, but it's starting to look like he might not be more than a fourth outfielder at best.","label":1}
{"text":"The Friday night starter for the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a sophomore and junior, PERSON helped lead the Cavaliers to their first ORGANIZATION title in his first year in that role, then followed it up with a strong junior campaign. Seen as a rather safe college performer who was more high floor than high ceiling, he lasted until the end of the second round, where the ORGANIZATION gave him an above-pick value bonus of $1.1 million.PERSON features a heavy fastball up to 93-94 mph, sitting more in the 90-92 mph range. It's more about the plus sink than the velocity and the right-hander gets a ton of groundball outs. He'll throw two breaking balls -- a curve he uses to get strike one and a better slider with good, late bite that often serves as his out pitch. He can mix in a solid changeup with good movement.Starting pitchers from GPE haven't fared well in the pro game, but PERSON seems a good bet to reach his ceiling, even if it's not as high as some others. After a heavy workload this spring, he'll be used sparingly this summer, really getting his pro career started in earnest in 2017.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON didn't sign as a 2nd rounder last year for unclear reasons and has had an up-and-down senior year, but his stuff was a little better down the stretch, likely allowing PERSON to go in the 2nd round again but now with less leverage and at nearly 23 years old.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON had the offensive ability to go in the top 10 rounds of the 2014 Draft, but he fell to the 26th round because teams worried about his signability. He decided to prove his worth in the ORGANIZATION and posted a .971 ORGANIZATION (which would have led the league if he had enough plate appearances to qualify) in the first half before the ORGANIZATION signed him for $150,000. He hit his way to Double-A in his first full pro season while also seeing his first extensive action at second base.PERSON has the bat speed and strength to produce for both average and power. To do so, he'll need to guard against his right-handed swing becoming too long and improve his strike-zone discipline and his ability to handle quality breaking pitches. He tends to hit the ball up the middle and to right-center, and the ORGANIZATION would like to see him pull more pitches so he can turn his plus raw power into more home runs.An outfielder in his first two years at ORGANIZATION and a third baseman as a junior, PERSON began 2015 playing second base full-time in low Class A and continued to work there in high Class A. He only played right field in Double-A and while he could fill in as an infielder if he gets to the big leagues, he's going to be more of a corner outfielder than a super-utilityman. He has the arm to play a variety of positions but lacks quickness and smooth infield actions, so PERSON has had him continue to focus on right field in 2016.","label":0}
{"text":" PERSON went three picks after PERSON, and both spent 2012, their first full seasons, in the ORGANIZATION State League. While PERSON turned in a decent debut season, PERSON struggled for most of the year and returned to PERSON in 2013. He pitched better, but a shoulder season ended his season early. PERSON's fastball touched the mid-90s, with good arm-side movement at ORGANIZATION, but his velocity has been down a tick in the ORGANIZATION. His changeup is the better of his two secondary pitches and could be above average in time. His breaking ball was inconsistent, and he had trouble commanding it. ORGANIZATION and control have been PERSON's biggest issues as a professional. If he can refine that, there's no reason why he can't be one of the better left-handed prospects in the game.","label":0}

Undaunted, GPE signed PERSON for $1.625 million last July.The early returns on that investment have the ORGANIZATION optimistic that they could have a future No. 3 starter on their hands. PERSON was so impressive in Spring Training this year that GPE sent him to Class A for his pro debut, and he got off to a terrific start at ORGANIZATION County.PERSON's stuff has bounced back to where he's pitching with a consistent 90-95 mph fastball. He also can get swings and misses with his curveball. PERSON has advanced feel for his changeup and for finding the strike zone with all three of his offerings.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON is a bowling ball-shaped left fielder that hits from an extreme crouch and has just enough power (55) to profile, but he's hit everywhere he's been and always had a good sense of the strike zone, which endears him to analytically-driven teams.","label":0}
{"text":" One look at PERSON, a 6-foot-6 right-hander, and you think \"durable starting pitcher.\" His inconsistencies on the mound, however, make some wonder if that's ultimately his best role, though he did make his big league debut as a starter in 2015.PERSON did shake off a slow start in his first taste of Triple-A in 2014 to finish the season well, but it left some question marks. PERSON's fastball has enough velocity, sitting in the low 90s and touching more than that at times. He throws it with good downward angle and sink when he's on, though he's up in the zone more than he should be. His changeup is his best secondary offering, with his slider coming in a close third. Both have the chance to be PERSON average, but again, he struggles to throw them consistently well. PERSON doesn't hurt himself with walks, but his command within the strike zone has hurt him. He'll continue to get work as a starter, but his fastball might play better in short relief, long-term.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON was a buzzy prospect in high school, coveted for his rare power\/spede combo and overall athleticism, becoming more intriguing due to his limited baseball reps as he pursued a football career at ORGANIZATION and LOCATION. The ORGANIZATION signed him out of high school to own his rights if football didn't work out and were happy when he hit the ground running in 2015 as a full-time baseball player at age 20 in full season ball with a surprising amount of polish, especially for pitch selection, for a kid who had never fully committed himself to baseball before. The tools are still flashy and profile as an well-rounded everyday center fielder that likely gets an extended big league look at some point in 2018.","label":1}
{"text":"PERSON started his professional career quickly, reaching Double-A Binghamton in his first full season. His ceiling is somewhat limited, but his advanced feel for pitching and three-pitch arsenal make him a solid prospect.PERSON throws his fastball in the low-90s, with good movement. He throws a splitter in lieu of a changeup, and his slider has good late break to it. PERSON will need to be a little more consistent with his secondary stuff, but both pitches have the potential to be average offerings.PERSON missed the first few months of the 2014 season due to a right lat strain, but he quickly got back up to speed once he returned to action. Though GPE still sees him as a starter, his power stuff would play up in the bullpen. PERSON is nearly ready for a chance to contribute in either role in the ORGANIZATION.","label":0}
{"text":"PERSON appeared in six games for ORGANIZATION (N.Y) as a freshman before transferring to GPE Stroudsburg University (Pa.), where he showed steady improvement as a starter over the next three years en route to becoming PERSON's seventh-round pick as a senior in 2016. A full-time move to the bullpen led to a breakout first full season for PERSON, as he showed impressive bat-missing ability, garnered All-Star honors in the Class A Advanced GPE League, and then capped his season with a successful turn in the ORGANIZATION. And while he began 2018 in extended spring training due to a hip\/sciatic issue, PERSON quickly made up for the lost time in Double-A upon returning and earned his first big league promotion in July. PERSON's smooth delivery and short, clean arm action create late life on a fastball that will sit 92-95 mph while touching 96. He pairs his heater with a sharp, late-breaking slider in the mid- to upper-80s, and it's those two offerings that enabled him to pace all GPE League relievers with 13.1 strikeouts-per-nine innings. The right-hander also has a curveball and changeup, both slightly below-average pitches, at his disposal, and his entire arsenal does play up on account of his solid control and command.PERSON's four-pitch mix and overall durability makes him a candidate to one day rejoin a starting rotation, should the ORGANIZATION ever choose to pursue that route. For now, however, it's PERSON's knack for missing bats using largely his fastball-slider combo that is his ticket to a potential late-inning role in the ORGANIZATION.","label":0}
{"text":"The son of former big league player and manager PERSON, L.J. PERSON was a senior sign out of UConn who received a bonus more than $140,000 under the pick value of where he was taken.

PERSON's best tool is his bat, a right-handed hitter with an advanced approach at the plate and solid on-base skills. While he's never going to be a huge home run hitter, he does have some extra-base ability. He doesn't seem to fear facing better pitching, and his bat got going further into the 2015 season. There were concerns about PERSON's defense, but he's improved at second base and the ORGANIZATION think he can stay there.

{"text":"The ORGANIZATION may have a reputation for developing young power arms and getting them to the big leagues. Their 2015 postseason run was fueled on them. PERSON, with his command rather than stuff approach, could give the staff an interesting change of pace.PERSON features a really good sinking fastball, one that touches 94 mph and sits in the 91-92 mph range. It's not an elite-level sinker, but the right-hander does elicit a fair share of ground-ball outs, throwing it downhill from his 6-foot-4 frame. Typically, sinkerballers use a slider as a breaking ball, but PERSON mixes in an average curveball he spins fairly well. His changeup is his best secondary offering, an average, if not better, offspeed pitch. PERSON throws strikes with all three and commands them well within the zone.PERSON made it to Double-A in 2015, finishing fifth in the organization in ORGANIZATION. His feel for pitching and ability to limit damage should allow him to reach his potential as a back-of-the-rotation starter.

While he's 6-foot-4, 200 pounds and a late-bloomer, he projects to be an average defender with an average arm at shortstop and has the bat speed to project continued performance at higher levels.

That was especially true since he was immediately moved from behind the plate, where he played at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, to first base. He did make his way to Double-A in his first full season and capped things off with a stint in the ORGANIZATION League.GPE utilizes an advanced approach at the plate to see a lot of pitches and draw walks, leading to a system-best 77 free passes in his first full season and a .375 on-base percentage. That, combined with a contact-oriented philosophy, should allow him to hit for a high average, and it was encouraging that he performed better in that category after his move up to Double-A in 2017. There are concerns that GPE won't have the power to fit the first base profile, but there is more pop for him to tap into and he sees value in knocking out 30 doubles annually while trying to get on base at a 40 percent clip, a pace he was keeping up in GPE has continued to work on his defense at his new position, something he prioritized in 2017, and he should be capable there.

He was sidelined for much of 2018 after he was struck by a pitch on the foot, but he put enough balls in play to note that his pull rate was up and his ground ball rate was down, and a hitter with this kind of innate talent would suddenly become very interesting if a swing change were to coax out some more power.

He has some pop, but not a ton of over-the-fence power right now. That might be an issue based on where he likely profiles best defensively. While he has played some center field, he is better suited for a corner spot. He runs the bases well, with his speed and outstanding instincts serving him well in the outfield as well. If the power doesn't come, he may not have the kind of impact bat teams like to have in a corner spot every day, so PERSON's future may be as a valuable fourth outfielder type.

He's a slightly above-average runner who is better underway and he's shown the skills to be a solid contact hitter from the left side of the plate.

A terrific on-mound athlete built like an ORGANIZATION quarterback, PERSON relies heavily on a sinking mid-90s fastball. The rest of his profile is pretty raw. He doesn't have great natural feel for spin, and it probably behooves him and the GPE to focus on changeup development if his mediocre strikeout rate is going to climb. But the sinker, and high-volume strike throwing ability, provide the foundation for an innings-eating backend starter at the least, and you can feel free to project heavily on much of the rest of PERSON's profile because of his prototypical frame and athleticism, though it's becoming more evident that spin isn't a teachable quality. There's risk PERSON is forced into the bullpen due to the lack of repertoire depth, but if his velo ticks up in max-effort, single-innings stints, he could be dominant.

The overall command is still a bit below average, mostly due to below average command of his off-speed stuff. PERSON can sometimes get cute and pitch backwards rather than focusing on developing fastball command and throwing his best pitch more often. There's still a shot that he can turn into a traditional starting pitcher, but it looks more likely that he'll be some kind of multi-inning middle relief or setup guy.

PERSON named him its 2019 national high school player of the year.A rare potential five-tool shortstop, PERSON didn't always make consistent contact on the showcase circuit last summer but scouts aren't worried about his bat. The right-handed hitter shows good barrel control and some willingness to use the entire field, so he could hit for average if he modifies his aggressive approach. His raw power and speed are both plus tools, which, combined with his baserunning instincts, could make him a 20-20 player.PERSON covers plenty of ground at shortstop, has quick hands and possesses the arm strength to make all the necessary throws -- as well as pump mid-90s fastballs from the mound. His love for the game is evident, and scouts praise his makeup as much as his physical ability. He'll turn 19 shortly after the 2019 Draft, making him old for his class and sophomore-eligible in '21 in the unlikely event he follows through on his commitment to GPE."}

He hasn't had any underlying change to his numbers, all of PERSON's strikeout and walk rates, as well as his batted ball profile, are in line with his career averages, but his swing change is visually similar to PERSON's and new Reds hitting coach, PERSON, comes from an org (ORGANIZATION) that has had success tweaking older hitters. We think there's a chance PERSON performs the way PERSON has since his debut, big power and lower OBPs from a corner outfield spot.

But he also struck out 135 times, mostly because he was looking at too many pitches. PERSON has the chance to hit for average and power once he figures out how to hit, or rather which balls he can drive. He needs to be more aggressive in the zone, recognizing 3-1 pitches to drive for extra bases instead of taking and then working a walk. He has plus raw power and once he starts figuring it out, it should show up in games more consistently. Primarily a first baseman in high school, PERSON first struggled in left field but has worked hard to become a capable right fielder, with better breaks and an improved throwing arm.PERSON earns praise from the organization for him managing his body well, adding good strength as he matures.

His fast rise continued in 2013 as he began the season in Class A Advanced PERSON. He handled the ORGANIZATION with aplomb as a 20-year old before being dealt to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION.

Though he slid until the eighth round of the 2015 PERSON amid signability concerns, he turned pro for $725,000. In November, PERSON was shipped off to the ORGANIZATION as part of the ORGANIZATION trade.Entering 2015, PERSON looked more like a polished lefty ticketed for three years of college at GPE.

He has a ton of raw power and extra-base ability, capable of driving the ball to all fields. With that pop comes a lot of swing and miss, leading to concerns about his hit tool. PERSON had largely played shortstop as a pro, but he got some time at third in the ORGANIZATION. While he didn't feel comfortable there at the outset, he played there and center field, where his athleticism plays well, upon his return from suspension.

PERSON easily settled the argument with a superior junior season, thrusting himself into consideration as a top-five-overall pick.PERSON manages the strike zone very well and makes consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate. He doesn't strike out as much as PERSON, has an edge in bat speed and his stroke is more geared to generate power at this point. He understands that he doesn't have to sell out to hit home runs, so he doesn't.PERSON doesn't offer much when he's outside of the batter's box, however. Though he has worked diligently to improve at third base, he lacks quickness and range, his hands are just fair and his arm is only average. He'll probably wind up at first base but has the offensive upside to profile there."}

If he doesn't have 80 raw power now, he will in the next few years, and he's actually an average runner underway, though his first step isn't great and he'll lose a step or two with maturity. PERSON has the arm to profile in right field, but down the road, he'll likely be an average glove there at best. There's obvious leverage to his swing and he hit 10 homers in 44 games in the ORGANIZATION as a 17-year-old, so it's not like he's sushi raw at tapping into his best tool. PERSON had similar tools at this stage, so that's one way this can go. Another would be former Tigers prospect PERSON, who played last year in GPE. There are also two massive corner outfielders with 80 raw power currently in the big leagues for the ORGANIZATION, so you know what PERSON looks like if everything goes perfectly, but a 42% strikeout rate in GPE ball isn't the best starting place from which to get there."}

PERSON has gotten stronger as a professional, and his fastball now comfortably sits in the mid 90s and touches 99 mph. His curveball has also made strides and is a swing-and-miss pitch at its best. His changeup shows promise, but he's still learning the pitch. He doesn't have great height for a right-hander, but the ORGANIZATION have helped him adjust his delivery to allow him to throw from a steeper downhill plane and create groundball outs.In addition to signing at an older age than most of his compatriots, PERSON missed almost all of the 2013 season due to injury. As a result, he hasn't thrown many innings as a professional, but his breakout performance already has scouts excited about his potential."}

GPE is an aggressive hitter, but like his uncle, he tends to make contact more than you think he should -- though some refinement would allow him to tap into that power more. GPE runs fairly well, and he has about as strong an outfield arm as you'll find in the ORGANIZATION. All of GPE's skills give him the potential to be the prototypical right fielder when all is said and done, but first he has to show he can use those considerable tools consistently on the field."}

And it is power that does show up in games, though he didn't swing the bat consistently well all summer. There are some holes in his swing, which will lead to some swing and miss, but those who have seen him when he's locked in have seen his ultra-quick hands and bat speed. He did show that he can make hard contact against good competition at times over the summer, though he'd been a bit inconsistent this spring. One concern was whether he could stick at third, and while PERSON showed well at the hot corner at a variety of summer events, some of those worries did resurface this spring.If a scouting director saw PERSON at the right time, he might think of the ORGANIZATION of GPE commit as a top 10 pick and one of the best high school hitters in the country.

He has shown the same velocity this spring.PERSON lacks prototypical size at 6-foot-1, but he generates his velocity with a quick arm and works down in the strike zone thanks to his high three-quarters arm slot. His delivery also helps him stay on top of his power curveball, which can be a plus pitch. His changeup has its moments as well.Though PERSON doesn't have much physical projection remaining, he already has enough stuff and just needs more consistency.

His fastball can touch triple-digits and he absolutely dominated the ORGANIZATION during his second stint there. The big reason for that was a cut in walks and improvement in his overall command, which made him much less hittable. He has the chance to have three at least average pitches, with an above-average curve that has a big break to it and an effective fading changeup that he throws with good arm speed. He still needs to cut down on the deep counts as he moves up the ladder. If he can become a more consistent strike-thrower, he has the chance to be a solid big league starter."}

He clearly had substantial raw power, but never slugged more than his freshman year mark of .437 at ORGANIZATION. Since college, PERSON's swing has evolved in a way that better incorporates his lower half. It has more scoop, more ability to catch pitches in, and he's better able to lift balls that are down. Supporting evidence can be found by observing PERSON's batted ball profile, as his groundball rate is now close to league average instead of well above it. Though he thickened quickly in college, PERSON is still an above-average runner once he gets underway. His slow first few steps prevent him from everyday viability in center field, and PERSON saw more time in the outfield corners last year than at any other time during his career. He projects as a platoon corner outfielder, especially if last year's swing changes were just the start of a continuous, upward trend in power output."}

PERSON has filled out some in the intervening time, and has sneaky raw power that may be above average at maturity. That, in combination with clearly above average bat control and enough patience that PERSON lays off pitcher's pitches, is a rare combination for an 18-year-old middle infielder. You can see why GPE pushed him to Hi-A and why he continued performing. PERSON is an above average runner and thrower but may not stick at shortstop, in which case he'll be fine at second base.

He might now have wow stuff, but what he has has been really good in 2015, all coming from an easy, simple delivery. He pitches off his fastball, which is a tick above-average sitting in the 92-94 mph range, and it plays up because of his feel for the strike zone.

He pitched his way from Double- to Triple-A in 2019 when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON Elias.After working in the low 90s during the regular season, PERSON's fastball was consistently 95-96 mph with improved late life in the ORGANIZATION. He has an above-average slider, thrown in the mid-80s with good depth, and also can mix in a fringy changeup. He has below-average control of all three pitches, though it stands to improve as he becomes more comfortable with his improved stuff out of the bullpen. PERSON dominated same-sided hitters in the ORGANIZATION with his fastball-breaking ball combo, holding them to a .184 average without allowing an extra-base hit in 54 plate appearances. Such success highlights PERSON's potential as a left-handed specialist, though he'll first have to improve his control as he navigates the upper Minors."}
{"label":1,"text":"PERSON was a top high school talent out of GPE in 2014 when the ORGANIZATION went well over pick value to sign him in the fifth round of that June's Draft. He was making slow, incremental progress, slowed periodically by injuries, when he was dealt to the Cardinals in July 2017 for international bonus pool money. He responded by having a breakout year, playing across two levels of the upper Minors and earning a spot on GPE' 40-man roster.PERSON has long had solid all-around tools with plus instincts that allow them to play up. More than anything, staying healthy was the key component in his leap forward in 2018 as he had a full season really for the first time in his career. He has a simple approach at the plate and was able to tap into the raw power he'd shown since high school by standing a little more upright at the plate and making his feet a little more narrow in his setup, leading to him more than doubling his career home run output heading into the season. PERSON has very good speed and excellent instincts on the basepaths, though he has to learn to be more efficient when stealing bases. His speed and instincts help him in the outfield, where he's above-average in center field and has more than enough arm to handle a corner spot if needed.If things keep moving in the right direction, PERSON has the upside to be a 15 homer-15 stolen base kind of offensive performer. He might be best suited as a valuable fourth outfielder, but seeing him play his way into an every day role in center field isn't out of the question."}
{"label":1,"text":"GPE and physically projectable, PERSON is highly likely to move off of shortstop and over to third base (or perhaps the the outfield) as he fills out. His swing is picturesque but undercut by the length of his levers and he looks much better taking BP than he does in games, but there's a good chance he grows into monster power and he need only tap into most of it to profile."}

He missed the first two weeks of the 2015 season with elbow soreness but bounced back after that.PERSON has a deep repertoire featuring four potential solid-or-better big league pitches and the ability to throw all of them for strikes. His best offering is his 90-96 mph fastball, and while he sometimes gets caught in between his curveball and slider, both can be weapons. His changeup similarly varies from inconsistent to effective. PERSON could have been a Draft pick in the top two rounds out of a ORGANIZATION high school in 2012 had he been signable away from GPE. The biggest knock on him is that he's just 6-foot-2 and 170 pounds, but he had been durable prior to this spring. His athleticism and sound delivery should allow him to remain a starter."}

PERSON suffered the same fate in 2012 but recovered and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in 2013. While he's a fringy hitter, there's no doubting his right-handed power, notably to the opposite field. His bat could get him to the big leagues, though he's limited to first base and is blocked in GPE by that PERSON fellow."}

An 80-game suspension following a positive test for the performance-enhancing drugs ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION leave everything somewhat in doubt.The ORGANIZATION had kept PERSON back in extended spring camp in 2015 to get the left-handed hitter to use the opposite field more. He bought in and was driving balls off the left-center-field wall early in his GPE ORGANIZATION season. While PERSON has decent contact skills, he needs to refine his approach to see more pitches and draw more walks so he can tap into his raw power more. His defense at third is below average, so he might have to move across the diamond to first. Consistency in the field has been an issue for PERSON, with some mechanical issues and subpar actions at times.PERSON came a long way in a short time, and there was hope he could develop into an average hitter with solid in-game power. The suspension puts a cloud over all of those projections."}
{"label":1,"text":"If you were to just look at PERSON' 2016 stats and then be told that he's really only a viable defensive fit at first base, you'd call him a non-prospect. A broken finger caused the downturn in production and in 2017 PERSON was back to taking monster hacks that produce comfortably plus raw power.

After a stunning pro debut pitching out of the bullpen, he moved into the rotation in 2017, finishing fourth in the system in strikeouts and sixth in ORGANIZATION, then moved up to Double-A, where he finished off a playoff no-hitter. His development is now in the hands of the D-backs, who acquired him in a three-team trade in February that sent PERSON to GPE York.PERSON's velocity ticked up at the start of his pro career, with his fastball jumping up to 93-97 mph. He continues to work on the consistency of his mid-80s slider and he's worked to refine his changeup and has had success with it. His stuff held up all year in his first full pro season and while making the transition from reliever to starter, though the ORGANIZATION kept him on a tight pitch limit. High spin rates on his fastball and breaking ball led to a lot of missed bats in 2017.PERSON has an athletic delivery that he can repeat well, which should lead to solid control. He had ulnar transposition surgery on his pitching elbow in the fall of 2015 and also missed time with back and knee issues in college, but he proved to be durable over 27 starts in 2017. Even if he returns to the bullpen, he could be a valuable arm for the D-backs in the future."}
{"label":0,"text":"The wave of teenage talent currently at Hi-A drove PERSON to push PERSON straight to Double-A to start his first full season, and he's risen to the occasion, off to a pretty strong start, at least from bat-to-ball standpoint. A minimalistic swing enables him to make high rates of contact while the strength in PERSON's hands generates doubles power. It's not an exciting, athletic style of hitting but on an inoffensive, fundamentally sound defensive shortstop, it's a pretty interesting skillset. Barring a significant swing change, PERSON's offensive output will likely cap his ceiling in the 40\/45 FV range, but for a third round pick who moves quickly, that's a great outcome."}

But he also spent three years in GPE ball and didn't make it to low Class A until 2017, which is one of the reasons PERSON didn't protect him.The Rockies clocked PERSON as fast as 104 mph and he generates consistent upper-90s fastballs with little effort. While he has a quick arm, impressive athleticism and little effort in his delivery, he has trouble controlling his heater. When he has to dial it down to throw strikes, it tends to get hit.PERSON also has a powerful slider in the upper 80s but has even more difficulty keeping it in the strike zone. He also has a changeup with similar velocity but it's not very effective and he's more of a two-pitch reliever.

He reached Double-A in 2018, his second season in the organization, then capped things off in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON' calling card is his breaking ball, and it's a real weapon against left-handed hitters but nasty enough to miss right-handed bats as well. He throws it with deception with late, sharp break, and hitters don't see it. It's the main reason why he carries a 12.2 K\/9 ratio into the 2019 season. His fastball sits in the low-90s coming from a low three-quarters slot, allowing it to play up beyond the velocity.PERSON' progress has been slowed a bit by a lack of consistency and command, though it's clear his two-pitch mix is plenty to get big league hitters out.

His heater is difficult for batters to lift, because it features heavy life, and PERSON uses his large strong frame to pitch on a steep downhill plane.PERSON has two different power breaking balls, with his slider, which reaches the mid 80s, grading better than his upper-70s curveball.

He has little effort in his simple delivery, repeating it with ease while pounding the strike zone with his entire repertoire.

There will always be some swing and miss to his game, but he did cut down his strikeout rate a touch in 2017 and he does offset the whiffs by drawing a good amount of walks. He has worked on his overall approach and tried to cut down on his swing to allow him to tap into his tremendous raw power consistently. PERSON is going to have to hit because he is a below-average defender in left field with a below-average arm. The ORGANIZATION love PERSON's work ethic and that he doesn't just spend all of his time in the cage working on his one carrying tool, instead putting in great effort to show he is capable enough to play the outfield regularly.

PERSON does have plus raw power and good feel to hit with a swing that has enough natural loft that scouts thihnk he'll hit for contact and power. That may take an adjustment that gets PERSON hitting the ball in the air more often, but the hope is that he just starts doing that naturally without mechanical compromise. PERSON looks athletic and fleet-footed enough to play an outfield corner right now but he's already a massive 225 pounds at a age 20 and will probably end up at first base.

He has an advanced feel for hitting and and hits line drives to all fields, but his command of the strike zone hasn't been as strong as usual in 2016. While PERSON is not a big guy, he has impressive bat speed and could develop double-digit home run power once he matures physically.PERSON's well-above-average speed makes him dangerous on the bases, though he's still learning the nuances of stealing. The biggest concern with him remains his arm, which hasn't bounced all the way back since he had surgery to repair a torn labrum in 2011. The Rockies are confident that PERSON's arm will be playable and that he can become an average defender at second base, with center field a possible fallback."}

With added mass and strength typically comes a reduction in straight line speed, but GPE hasn't slowed down just yet and still looks like a possibility to stay in center, though most scouts who saw him in pro ball think he'll eventually move to left field. Regardless, there's a whole lot more bat here than there was on our pre-draft evaluation of GPE, who has risen to the top of the promising teenage hitter group in this system because he has a chance to hit for average and power while the rest are likely to do just one of those."}

He can run his curve into the upper 70s with 11-to-5 break and keep right-handers at bay with his sinking changeup.Though there's some effort in GPE's delivery and his control has slipped a notch this spring, he usually locates his pitches where he wants. That's important to his future success because he has no projection left in his stocky 6-foot-1 frame and little margin for error.

He returned over a month later and has been good down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs. He still hasn't shown the promise from the summer, as he's completely lost feel for his slider. He only threw the pitch in games this spring a handful of times and scouts speculated it made his arm hurt, but he threw it in some of the postseason workouts and simply had no feel for the pitch anymore.\n\nThe curveball that replaced it is similar to PERSON's curveball and is often a 45 or 50, maybe a 55 once a start but not often enough to project it as such. He's healthy, teams are clearing his medical and the arm speed is back, but his frame is now maxed-out and it's unclear where his breaking ball went and if it will come back. He's seen as very signable and the team that takes him will be banking on him returning to form; we've assumed there's a little more slider feel that will be teased out but not the 60 pitch of the summer."}
{"label":0,"text":"The son of former ORGANIZATION player PERSON, this 6-foot-6 right-hander was delayed in the start of his senior season because of his own high school basketball exploits. He was rushing up ORGANIZATION boards as the spring progressed.A premium athlete, PERSON uses every inch of his frame to his advantage on the mound. Though he started late because his basketball team made a deep postseason run, PERSON was nonetheless up to 96-97 mph with his fastball in early outings. He combines that with hard, power curve that has very good bite to it. His changeup will be his third pitch, but he's shown some feel for it and it should be a viable option in the future. PERSON's size, athleticism, stuff and projectability had decision-makers rushing in to see him in GPE. The ORGANIZATION commit has risen to close to the top of the high school pitching list and could very well hear his name called in the first round."}
{"label":0,"text":"PERSON entered his senior year of high school as a talented two-sport project with a, having size and arm speed, but inconsistent command, offspeed stuff, and somewhat strange east\/west elements to his delivery. His superior athleticism shone through in the spring, along with improved direction to the plate, and the ORGANIZATION popped him ninth overall in 2016 with an eye toward PERSON becoming a frontline starter. \nEarly in pro ball, PERSON had some real trouble with strike-throwing, then slowly settled in. He has two easy plus pitches in his fastball and curveball, but his changeup is almost always below average, and his command comes and goes. His fastball plays up due to his excellent extension, but he gets so much extension that he overstrides and it reduces the amount of feel he has, both in his changeup and command. If PERSON can dial down the aggression in his delivery a bit, the starter traits should come to the forefront and give the ORGANIZATION a No. 2 or 3 starter."}
{"label":0,"text":" PERSON doesn't have premium stuff, but his results since being drafted in the 20th round in 2011 have forced evaluators to take note of him. He led the ORGANIZATION with 175 strikeouts in 2013 and was well on his way to a strong follow-up campaign at ORGANIZATION before undergoing PERSON surgery in June 2014. That didn't deter the ORGANIZATION from selecting him in the Rule 5 Draft in December. When healthy, PERSON succeeds without overpowering stuff thanks to his deceptive delivery, command and pitchability. He hides the ball well and throws from a low arm slot, making it tough for hitters to pick up the ball. His fastball sits around 90 mph and he mixes in a short slider and changeup. PERSON has exclusively worked as a starter in the ORGANIZATION, scouts have long felt he might fit better in the bullpen. That's where he's likely to get his chance to stick with the ORGANIZATION, once he gets back on the mound."}
{"label":1,"text":"PERSON flashed promise but lacked consistency during his three years in UNC-Greensboro's starting rotation. The ORGANIZATION were happy to gamble on his size and his potential in the 2014 Draft, however, when they selected him in the third round and signed him for $425,000. The big right-hander rewarded their faith with a strong full-season debut the following year and continued to climb the ladder in 2016, culminating with an impressive second-half showing in Double-A. The ORGANIZATION acquired PERSON and PERSON last ORGANIZATIONvember in exchange for 2014 first-rounder (ORGANIZATION. 6 overall pick) PERSON, and he made his big league debut in June after a strong start to his season in Double-A.A towering presence on the mound, PERSON uses his 6-foot-8 frame to create a steep downhill plane to the plate and generate weak ground balls. He pitches with an average fastball, sitting at 90-92 mph and touching 94 with his heater, though it tends to play up because he hides the ball and gets good extension over his front side. PERSON's changeup is his best secondary pitch and receives above-average grades from scouts, and he also can flash average with a curveball that has a big 12-to-6 shape but inconsistent pace.PERSON is athletic for his size and repeats his delivery well. He projects to have at least average control and command of his three-pitch mix, giving him the potential to develop into a ORGANIZATION. 4 starter."}
{"label":0,"text":"It's possible PERSON would have been PERSON's best everyday option at catcher toward the end of last year, but a desperate need for pitching depth facilitated his trade to PERSON for PERSON. PERSON is an athletic catcher with a plus arm, average receiving skills, and some feel to hit. After struggling to perform with the bat during the first several years of his career, PERSON has two straight season of league-average offensive performance at ORGANIZATION and Triple-A. He has a pull-and-lift style of hitting, but not enough raw power to optimize that kind of approach. He's a safe bet to be a quality backup and has a non-zero chance to hit a little more than we expect and be a low-end regular."}
{"label":0,"text":"ORGANIZATION fans should get ready for another GPE to pitch in GPE very soon. PERSON is the nephew of former big leaguer PERSON, who spent several years pitching for the ORGANIZATION. He's knocking on the door, having reached Triple-A in 2012, though he missed considerable time with injuries. When he was on the mound, he continued to show tremendous stuff while developing a better feel for pitching. The arm strength has always been there and GPE shows a plus fastball, up to 96-97 mph. There's some sink to it as well and he gets a good amount of ground-ball outs as a result. He throws both a slider and a curve. The curve is better, especially when he stays on top it, throwing it with tight spin. The slider has a cutter action to it and both it and his changeup have the chance to be average pitches. If his command can continue to improve, he has the chance to contribute as a starter. If not, he'll definitely contribute out of the bullpen."}
{"label":0,"text":"PERSON doesn't have as much experience playing center field as you'd expect for a 65 to 70 runner from GPE that's played on some solid teams domestically and internationally. He played in the corners in deference to more experienced defenders and also played a good bit of first base in GPE to save his arm, since he also pitched. Like most GPE defectors, he's cleaned up his frame a bit since leaving the island and also added more speed and power. PERSON should be able to stick in center, but he just hasn't been seen playing the position in many games recently, though he has enough arm for right field if for some reason he needs to slide to a corner. There's power for 15-18 homers, but it'll likely play lower than that with his more contact-focused approach; most scouts I spoke with hanging a 50 on his bat and a 45 on his game power (12-15 homers), easily projecting him as an everyday player if he sticks in center as expected. It isn't the most electric, toolsy GPE prospect in recent memory, but it's roughly comparable to PERSON, with less raw power. PERSON is a good bit younger than PERSON and will get far less due to some uncertainty about his skills and the limits of the international pools. The ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION have shown the most interest after PERSON's camp decided to wait for the next signing period, though it sounds like the ORGANIZATION made an attempt to sign him at the end of the last period."}

He reached Triple-A in his first year in the ORGANIZATION' system after being acquired in a trade for PERSON, but he drew a 50-game suspension in the offseason after testing positive for a stimulant.PERSON may be small (5-foot-10, 170 pounds) and possess below-average fastball velocity, but he is effective because he's extremely deceptive, mixes four pitches and locates them where he wants. His fastball maxes out at 93 mph, but hitters don't punish it because it features good life and he works it to both sides of the plate and down in the strike zone. His best offering is his solid curveball, and he also can get swings and misses with his average slider and changeup.Throwing from a variety of arm slots to keep hitters off-balance, PERSON has dominated left-handers as well as right-handers. He's a good bet to become at least a middle reliever in the big leagues and could ascend to that role in 2016."}

PERSON rewarded the ORGANIZATION by dominating in his first two pro seasons and then reached Double-A at age 20 in 2016. However, it will now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further his development after they acquired PERSON and PERSON in the ORGANIZATION Lucroy-Jeremy Jeffress Trade Deadline blockbuster.PERSON combines stuff and feel better than most young pitchers. His strong build allows him to maintain his 92-97 mph fastball deep into ballgames, and his low-80s slider gives him a plus second pitch. PERSON threw his changeup sparingly as an amateur, but has developed it enough as a pro to where scouts view it as a potentially average pitch. Meanwhile, a clean and repeatable delivery has helped to make PERSON an accomplished strike-thrower early in his career.Much like GPE, PERSON impressed last summer in his brief ORGANIZATION debut, and he continued to do so in 2017, his first full year with the organization. He lacks projection in his physical 6-foot-3 frame and needs to stay healthy, but PERSON has both the stuff and command profile to develop into a No. 2 starter."}

He was having an impressive sophomore campaign, too, before he fractured his right thumb in GPE, prematurely ending his 2015 season.PERSON makes a lot of contact, thanks to his quick swing, excellent hand-eye coordination and innate feel for the barrel. He has a line-drive stroke and, while power will never be a part of his game, drives the gaps well. His above-average speed gives him all the tools to fit at the top of the order.PERSON has a strong arm, and scouts believe he has the skills necessary to remain at shortstop.

When the opportunity arose to bring GSP into the fold at the ORGANIZATION in 2014, the D-backs didn't miss a second time, getting the southpaw as part of the ORGANIZATION deal with PERSON. GSP blossomed with the D-backs and earned his first taste of the Majors in 2017, only to be traded for the second time in his career during the offseason when he was shipped to the ORGANIZATION in a three-team trade with the ORGANIZATION. GSP pitched across two levels, reaching Triple-A in 2016 while leading the organization in strikeouts and finishing second in ORGANIZATION, though he struggled to repeat those results in 2017, both in Triple-A and the ORGANIZATION. He has had success with a solid, if unspectacular, three-pitch mix, commanding all pitches fairly well. His fastball is above-average, thrown in the 90-95 mph range, and he's shown the ability to reach back for more when he needs it. His curveball has developed into a plus pitch and he has good feel for his changeup. When he's on his game, he executes his gameplan better than most.There could be more in the tank for GSP, an encouraging sign for a guy who already is on the cusp of a big league job. His 150- and 147 2\/3-inning seasons in 2016-17 are a pretty good predictor of what kind of workhorse starter he is going to be in the big leagues."}

He's wiry and projectable but already strong, and he has present pull power that projects to plus.

PERSON has some pitch recognition issues that lead to strikeouts. Those create uncertainty about his profile, but they'll be more acceptable if he can stay on the dirt.

He ultimately turned down the ORGANIZATION as 30th-rounder to attend ORGANIZATION, where his father PERSON had played en route to a big league career. Much like former ORGANIZATION star PERSON, an GPE first-rounder in 2018, PERSON has confounded evaluators with the dichotomy between his success with metal bats (.939 ORGANIZATION, 42 homers in two-plus years with the ORGANIZATION) and struggles with wood (.570 ORGANIZATION, three homers in two summers in the ORGANIZATION).If scouts were convinced that PERSON will hit with wood, he'd likely be the first college shortstop drafted in June. A switch-hitter, he has some timing issues and a swing that tends to get long, leading to strikeouts. His strength and leverage already generate plus raw power, and he should have more as he fills out his lanky 6-foot-3 frame.There are no holes in the rest of PERSON's game.

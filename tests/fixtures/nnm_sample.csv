Turkey is open to allowing captured Canadian ISIS members to transit through the country so they can return to Canada for prosecution, a Turkish official said in an interview.

The official told Global News that Turkey was willing to co-operate with the RCMP to repatriate the dozens of Canadians caught by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces during the collapse of ISIS.

“I think we would be positive to that,” said the official. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, the official and a colleague spoke on the condition they would not be identified.

They said Turkey would not deal directly with the Kurdish forces holding the Canadians in Syria but said if the RCMP or Canadian Armed Forces brought them to the border, they would be allowed through.

“With some imagination, I suppose a way could be found,” the official said.

The RCMP has been exploring options for bringing the roughly 30 Canadians held by the Syrian Democratic Forces back to Canada. Turkey is considered the preferred route.

The Liberal government has said it would be difficult to get the Canadians out of Syria because they could be arrested and charged by authorities in neighbouring Turkey and Iraq.

But in a national security podcast released Friday, two experts said Canada’s current policy of inaction was not a lasting solution and the government needed to find a way to get them home.

“There needs to be something done about these Canadians that are abroad,” said Leah West, a former Department of Justice lawyer and now a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto faculty of law.

Speaking on A Podcast Called Intrepid, she told hosts Stephanie Carvin and Craig Forcese that countries needed to work out a collective solution, “because leaving them in the hands of the Kurds is not sustainable.”

Jessica Davis, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service analyst and now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said while returning them to Canada had its own challenges, it had to be done.

“I think leaving them overseas is much more problematic from a threat perspective. There’s a possibility of being released, of being reintegrated into ISIS forces. All of those things just make it worse,” she said.

While the RCMP has been looking into transiting the Canadians through Turkey, it wants to ensure Turkish authorities would not question the detainees or search their electronic devices.

Doing so could taint their prosecution in Canada. Upon their arrival in Canada, the RCMP intends to lay charges when possible or seek peace bonds to restrict their actions.

The RCMP sees Turkey as a better option than Iraq, where foreign ISIS members could face death sentences. An RCMP delegation visited Turkey in March, and officials from the two NATO allies held recent security consultations.

One complication is who would hand the detainees over to Turkish authorities. The coalition holding the Canadians is dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units or YPG.

Turkey views the YPG as part of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization.

“We wouldn’t deal directly with the YPG. I don’t see that possibility,” the Turkish official said. “We don’t deal with terrorists.”

Those currently in detention in Syria include a Canadian who used social media to encourage terrorist attacks in Canada, and another who is believed to have helped produce ISIS execution videos.

Several Canadian women and their children are also among the detainees.

Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, and the capture of thousands of foreign fighters and their families, the RCMP has ramped up preparations for their possible return of Canadians.

“We need to get ready in case they come back sooner than what we had expected,” Deputy Commissioner Gilles Michaud, who heads the RCMP’s federal policing branch, said in February.

To the extent possible, he said, the RCMP is trying to have charges ready before they set foot back on Canadian soil and is working with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to see what can be used as evidence.

Canada is a shit name for a company based in the west anyway. Good riddance.,"TransCanada Corp. is officially dropping the ""Canada"" from its name, but CEO Russ Girling isn't saying he expects it will make it any easier to get pipelines approved in Canada or the United States.

The Calgary-based company is now to be called TC Energy Corp., after shareholders approved the change at its annual meeting Friday.

""The name TC Energy acknowledges our origin as TransCanada PipeLines, while adding the word 'energy' speaks to the breadth of our business, which includes pipelines, power generation and energy storage,"" Girling told the meeting.

""But to be clear, this is a name change, not a brand name. We are very proud of who we are and what we do.""

He declined to talk to reporters after the event.

The company said the change recognizes its growth into the United States and Mexico, including through its recent $13-billion US purchase of U.S. natural gas transporter Columbia Pipeline Group.

It has about 7,000 employees in North America, with 3,500 in Canada, 3,200 in the U.S. and 300 in Mexico.

But some analysts suggest it's also a chance to distance itself from Canada, where difficulty in getting pipeline projects approved has been blamed for a glut of oil that caused steep discount pricing last fall and prompted the Alberta government to curtail production starting in January.

""I think the name change is semantics,"" U.S.-based analyst Jennifer Rowland of Edward Jones wrote in an email.

""I don't think it attracts new investors, but I do think it's a subtle, or not so subtle depending on how you view it, way to de-emphasize Canada as some investors are leery of investing in Canada given the government intervention in free markets in Alberta and the difficult regulatory environment for energy.""

TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta into the U.S. was first proposed in 2008, rejected by then-president Barack Obama in 2015, approved by President Donald Trump in 2016 and again in March, but remains on hold awaiting court rulings in Montana and Nebraska.

The court delays mean the project will not be able to start construction in the U.S. this year, Paul Miller, president of liquids pipelines, confirmed during an afternoon conference call with financial analysts.

The project could still be unfinished if a new federal government is elected in the U.S. in 2020, he added, but it's hoped all permits and approvals will be in hand by then and a new administration won't affect bringing the project on stream.

Shareholders at the meeting voted almost 90 per cent against a motion sponsored by the Pension Plan of the United Church of Canada that would have required the company to report on how it is meeting international standards for Indigenous people's rights.

They went along with the company's recommendation to reject the motion as unnecessary given its existing policies.

The official approval of the name change came as the company reported a first-quarter profit of $1 billion of $1.09 per share, up from $734 million or 83 cents per share a year ago.

Revenue for the first quarter totalled $3.49 billion, compared with $3.42 billion in the first quarter of 2018.

On a comparable basis, TransCanada says it earned $987 million or $1.07 per share for the quarter, up from $864 million or 98 cents per share a year ago.

Analysts on average had expected a profit of 99 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon."

Listen, I don't mind people leaving Canada and collecting their pension.  But there needs to be some accountability here","The spouse of a Saskatchewan pensioner who died kept receiving monthly pension payments for almost 10 years before the provincial government found out.

Now the province is trying to recover more than $110,000 in illegal payments, according to the government's most recent quarterly report on losses of public money.

The report said between 2007 and 2016, payments totalling $111,541 were deposited into the bank account of the deceased pensioner's spouse.

The Teachers' Superannuation Commission has recovered $80,415 and is pursuing the remaining amount of $31,126.

The matter was referred to the police.

The provincial losses report also revealed a contract manager was given an 18-month sentence after stealing rent receipts and submitting false expense claims totaling about $114,000 from the Saskatchewan Housing Corporation.

A 2016-17 fourth quarter report found a preliminary loss of about $2,000 due to the contract manager stealing rent receipts and submitting false expense claims. A further investigation revealed the loss was much higher.

The court also ordered the former manager to pay back the money."
That Quebec Biker war ended around 20 years ago.,"Police north of Toronto have charged a father and son after officers found explosive materials and a detonator device at a home in Richmond Hill, Ont.

Reza Mohammadiasl, 47, and his son Mahyar, 18, were arrested on Monday and charged with one count each of possession of an explosive device following a search of their home. Both men were scheduled to appear in Newmarket court on Tuesday.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the arrests and charges are a local matter that concerns York police and there is no known connection to national security.

""There is no known connection to any issue related to national security,"" he said in Ottawa. ""It is a local policing matter. Obviously they've made arrests, they've laid charges, and it's up to them to comment further.""

Border agents tipped off police

York Regional Police said the investigation began last Thursday when they received information about a person being investigated by the United States Customs and Border Protection and the Canada Border Services Agency.

On Friday, police executed a search warrant at a home on Larratt Lane, near Bathurst Street and Elgin Mills Road West, and discovered explosive materials. Police did not specify what exactly the materials were or how much was removed. They said chemicals were also seized.

Ontario Provincial Police, along with the York police's explosives detection unit, helped to removed the materials.

As a precaution, police practically shut down the street on Friday, forcing neighbours from their homes and restricting vehicle and pedestrian traffic as officers carried out their work. Neighbours have since been allowed back into their homes, police said.

Despite, evacuation orders being lifted and the suburban street returning to normal, residents say they have been left feeling uneasy.

Jill Garazi, who has lived on Larratt Lane for 16 years, said the experience was ""very stressful and traumatic.""

Area resident Rajneesh Bir said crime was so uncommon in the neighbourhood that even minor robberies were rare.

""Suddenly we hear about explosives and wow. It's very scary,"" Bir said.

'It's a very serious case for sure'

Const. Andy Pattenden, spokesperson for the York Regional Police, said officers are investigating how the materials got into the home, why they were there and what the accused planned to do with them.

""We don't often see things like this. It's a very serious case for sure. The charge, possession of explosives, is a very serious charge,"" Pattenden said.

""Thankfully, nobody was injured in this particular case. But there's lots more to this investigation. That's why we really need some tips and help from the public as to how these materials got there, why they were there and what these two people were up to.""

Police had a presence at the home on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Pattenden said.

In a news release on Tuesday, police said dangerous chemicals being stored in a home can pose serious risks, including fires and explosions.

They urged members of public to call police if they see any suspicious activity, notice chemical odours, or unusual storage or stockpiling of chemicals and to take precautions.

Hazardous materials should never be eaten, inhaled or consumed, and even slightly inhaling a chemical can cause serious injury, they said. If a material is considered hazardous, police urge the public to leave the area and call 911.

""If you witness anyone dumping material that appears to be hazardous waste, get the best description as possible and call police immediately. Never approach the suspects,"" police said.

Police would like to hear from anyone who knows the two accused or who has information that may help investigators."
You’re right. Thank you.,"Afterlife violated the copyrighted work of grieving families in order to make a profit, a judge in Ottawa ruled in ordering damages to be paid in a class-action lawsuit.

The lawsuit was filed in Federal Court in Ottawa by Newfoundland lawyer Erin Best on behalf of client Dawn Thomson, who was shocked to find her father's obituary on the website.

""Afterlife's conduct, aptly characterized as 'obituary piracy,' is high-handed, reprehensible and represented a marked departure from standards of decency,"" wrote Justice Catherine Kane.

Afterlife effectively copied and pasted obituaries and photographs that had been published elsewhere, and passed the content off as its own.

It was like someone had ripped my chest out again. - Raylene Manning-Puddister, grieving mom

It outraged families by selling memorial-themed products like candles and sympathy cards that unwitting friends and family could purchase — but with all the revenue going to Afterlife.

She ordered Afterlife — run by Pascal Leclerc — to pay $20 million in damages, and an injunction against the website to prevent it from operating in the future.

Leclerc initially hired a lawyer to handle his defence, but eventually backed out of the proceedings, leading to Kane issuing a default judgment.

Shock and disgust

Thomson's father, Denis Trainor, passed away in early 2017. A year later, she saw his obituary posted on Afterlife's website, where people could pay for things like digital flowers and candles.

""Ms. Thomson described her outrage and mortification that others would think she sought to profit from her father's death,"" wrote Kane.

While Thomson was the face case for the class action, the lawsuit was launched after events set in motion by a different grieving Newfoundlander.

Raylene Manning-Puddister was sitting at home one morning when she went to Google her son's baseball stats.

Although she has them memorized, she said, ""being a bereaved mom, it's just a dark road you walk every day of your life.""

Instead, she found his obituary as one of the top hits.

It was the same one she had written in 2012, when her 22-year-old-son, Tyller Pittman, passed away. To her surprise, it was posted on a site she had never seen before.

You would have a heart of stone if you were not moved by these people. - Erin Best, lawyer

""His obituary was literally word for word. The same pictures. There wasn't even any change in what I wrote myself.""

Afterlife had even used a poem Manning-Puddister had written for her son, placed alongside paid advertising and options to purchase digital tokens of sympathy.

""It was like someone had ripped my chest out again. I felt like I'd literally gotten kicked in the stomach,"" she said. ""Who in the world would do something so horrific to take advantage of bereaved parents, of people that lost their parents?""

Manning-Puddister called into CBC's St. John's Morning Show, where she shared her story and questioned how it was legal.

CBC then called Best to weigh in on whether it was copyright infringement. She later decided to file a lawsuit.

'They were absolutely devastated'

In her ruling, Kane said the site had infringed on copyrights by lifting the obituaries and photos of the deceased from other websites.

She awarded $10 million in statutory damages and $10 million in aggravated damages.

Best said once she announced she was filing a suit, she was bombarded with people who were furious, hurt, shocked and disgusted by Afterlife.

""You would have a heart of stone if you were not moved by these people,"" she said. ""They were absolutely devastated ... they felt like it was a kick in the stomach at their most vulnerable time.""

Whether any of the plaintiffs will see any money remains to be seen, Best said.

The site had posted more than one million Canadian obituaries at the time it was taken down. Afterlife now directs people to another website, Everhere, which the judge said is also run by Leclerc.

Everhere drew ire in Saskatchewan last year when families of victims of the Humboldt Broncos crash learned it was selling similar products without their permission.

Kane requested the injunction should name Leclerc personally, so he cannot continue posting obituaries on Everhere.

How do you figure?,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

*looks at US shale production*,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

Among the new jobs created in April were 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."
That you're no longer in Iran and women should be free to wear what they want?,"After spending all day hearing from defenders of his secularism bill, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette was confronted Tuesday evening with a challenge from a wispy-haired, 87-year-old philosopher.

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."

Michael Chertoff has a warning for Canada about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Canada's federal government is currently deciding whether Huawei can be trusted to build the next generation of Internet infrastructure across the country.

Chertoff, who was the United States' homeland security secretary under former president George W. Bush, says that decision could have major consequences for Canada's relationships with both China and the United States.

Meanwhile, Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is due to appear in a Vancouver court where a judge will consider an extradition request from the United States.

Here is part of Chertoff's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.

Mr. Chertoff, how is the United States likely to respond if Justin Trudeau agrees to allow Huawei 5G network to be a principal part of our system?

I think it's going to raise concerns about the security of your system.

We've seen stories recently, in fact, involving more back doors or problems with Chinese software and hardware.

So that's going to create some obstacles to the ability to rapidly share data because they're concerned that there'll be a compromise.

You know that China says that Huawei is a private company — that the Chinese government is not involved with it and that there are firewalls that would protect these networks from any kind of Chinese influence. What does the United States think of that?

I think most Americans are skeptical of that for a number of reasons.

First of all, the Chinese clearly anoint certain companies as champions and support them.

And if you just look at what happened recently, with respect to Canadians being arrested in China as retaliation for the arrest of a senior Huawei official, it suggests a degree of solicitude for the company by the Chinese government that is is not consistent with the idea that they're independent.

To could give the Chinese the ability to occupy a pivotal part of your infrastructure, one that will be, as I say, the commanding heights of the next 10 or 20 years of the economy, you're giving them enormous leverage in any dispute.

You're giving them a surface area for which they can potentially take intellectual property or otherwise compromise confidential material and you have to, I think, seriously view China as a rival, if not an adversary.

What could they potentially do?

Well, they could either find or embed pathways in to compromise networks and allow the theft of intellectual property.

They could introduce disruption or latency into the network because it's not just the hardware and software that you first install. It's all of the updates, the patches, everything you do to them to tend to and monitor the system going forward.

It's not just a question of taking data and either misusing it or stealing intellectual property. This will actually be part of the mechanism that controls your industrial control systems and your operating systems.

So the person who dominates that, in a way, has the ability to affect everything from your power grid to your air traffic control system to your even your sensitive national security infrastructure.

The Canadian government is deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention of two Canadians in China. Read my statement: <a href=""https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc"">https://t.co/4Mxk6t89cc</a> —@cafreeland

As you mentioned, we have two Canadians who are detained in China, held in isolation. Two others on death row. In other matters, our trade is being deeply effected as the Chinese shut us out of the markets. All this because of this extradition request from your country for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meanwhile, your president is busy securing a comprehensive free trade agreement with China and moving ahead and benefiting. So do you understand why Canadians might feel like we're being played here?

Well, I don't think that's a fair inference. Look, I think there are a couple of different things.

First of all, I mean obviously the security relationship the U.S. and Canada have is a very strong one. We're allies and I don't think anybody believes the U.S. is an ally of China — nor is it clear to me what's going to come out of this trade agreement.

I think what actually is demonstrated by Chinese behaviour is that when you're touching on what they view as one of their national champions, they will use any leverage they have to punish you.

And that ought to cause people to ask the question: well geez, if we give them the keys to the kingdom on our 5G network, what will they do if they don't like something we do in the future?

But wait a second. We arrested Meng Wanzhou at your behest, at your government's behest, and we're being punished while you move ahead with getting the trade deals that we're shut out of now. So I guess the question is, you know, at some point this seems rather unfair to us.

First of all, I don't know whether the Chinese aren't going to try to punish the U.S.

But if you're asking me why the Chinese decided they were going to focus on Canada in retaliating, I think it suggests they're trying to bully Canada and it may be that they feel they can get away with it more with Canada or that they can intervene before the extradition gets done.

Well, maybe the United States should start pushing back at our behest a bit.

I think we may see some further developments. I would not describe your relationship between China and the U.S. as a warm and fuzzy relationship.

There are a lot of different deals going on but I would be very careful not to have the Chinese try to drive a wedge between the Canadians and the Americans, by making it seem as if they're picking on one and not on the other.

Well, President Trump has said that he may trade Meng Wanzhou for getting his trade deals. So, maybe we're being played by your country as well.

I don't know what you're referring to and I don't read Twitter as a map for what's going to happen.

I would not presume anybody knows what's going to be the next step in all this because there are a lot of balls in the air.

Is it not true that President Trump suggested that he could exchange Meng Wanzhou for a trade deal with China?

He often says all kinds of different things, which never come to pass. So I'm not going to speculate as to what was in his head. But I'm not going to presume that this has any realistic prospect of happening.

"15 years ago Americans  abused the Canadian health care system by getting health card's, the government made it they have to be a legal resident and paying taxes  in order for Non- Canadians to be in the system. It was also around the same time, bus loads would come up here for Prescription Drugs and lead to shortages here. This also needs to be stopped.","Quinn Nystrom was expecting the worst.

She thought the U.S. Border Patrol would want to search her car. That she would be bombarded with questions. That they would demand she show her prescription for insulin.

Worst of all, she was worried they would confiscate the small, cold vials of a life-saving drug that she had crossed the border to buy at a pharmacy in Fort Frances, Ont.

But it didn't happen. Not for Nystrom, not for anyone in her small group from Minnesota — calling themselves the Caravan to Canada — who were on a mission last weekend to buy insulin at one-tenth the price of what it's listed in the United States.

As the cost of insulin continues to skyrocket in the U.S., where pharmaceutical companies can dictate the price, people are making the trek north as an alternative to paying thousands of dollars to stay alive.

The small group drove five hours from Minnesota to Ontario to buy insulin at one-tenth the cost. (Rachel Nystrom)

Insulin and many other drugs cost less in Canada, thanks to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, a federal agency that establishes the maximum price that can be charged for patented drugs.

So while an influx of Americans crossing the border to buy insulin won't affect the price, it could hurt supply in Canada.

""There absolutely is some degree of risk,"" said Barry Power, director of therapeutic content with the Canadian Pharmacists Association.

""If you look at the disparity in the populations, a small percentage of Americans coming to Canada is a disproportionate increase for services and supplies that are earmarked for Canada.""

For Americans, it's hardly a long-term solution. For some, it's the only option.

And for others, it's already too late.

Nicole Smith-Holt, also from Minnesota, joined last weekend's Caravan to Canada. Her son, Alec Smith, died in June 2017 from diabetes complications. She said he had been rationing his insulin when he couldn't afford to buy more.

""Mine was a symbolic fight, and going to see how easy and accessible and affordable it is at a pharmacy in Canada,"" she said. ""If I had known about this in 2017, I would have made that trip in 2017 and been able to save his life.""

'Desperate measures'

Nystrom, who has Type 1 diabetes, requires insulin to stay alive. She is on a type of fast-acting insulin called NovoLog, which costs about $300 US a vial. The Canadian equivalent, NovoRapid, is about $30 per vial. She was shocked to learn about the price difference.

""I almost felt walking out of that pharmacy like I was robbing the pharmacy. I just couldn't believe it,"" she said.

But border towns across Canada have seen Americans coming to buy medication for years.

The Guardian Johnson Drug Store in Perth-Andover, N.B., sits just shy of seven kilometres east of the U.S. border. Pharmacist Jill MacIntosh said the store has about 10 patients who come regularly from the U.S.

""We see probably at least one person a week,"" she said.

Dr. Seema Nagpal, vice-president of science and policy with Diabetes Canada, said her organization is paying attention to the cross-border traffic and potential insulin shortfalls.

""We try to keep our ear to the ground and hear as early as we can if that is becoming a problem, but we just haven't heard that yet.""

Nagpal said there are major health risks for people who can't afford to pay for their insulin.

""When a person doesn't have access to treatment that they need in order to sustain their life and to have a future, absolutely I understand there would be desperate measures in order to maintain their health,"" she said.

But she said Canadians also struggle to pay for their insulin.

""Many people are forced to make choices about whether they pay rent, whether they put certain foods on the table versus filling their prescriptions,"" she said, adding Diabetes Canada hears about insulin rationing in Canada, as well.

Pharmacists in both Canada and the U.S. say Americans coming north for cheaper insulin isn't a solution to the problem. (Reed Saxon/The Associated Press)

How long a vial of insulin lasts depends on how much a person takes. It could be anywhere from a week to a month.

Right now, insulin isn't available as a generic drug in the U.S., because pharmaceutical companies have made small improvements to insulin over the years to keep it under patent.

Nystrom has health insurance in Minnesota through the Affordable Care Act. But she's on what she calls a high-deductible plan: She pays $370 US a month for the plan itself, but has to pay a $7,800 US deductible before her plan will cover her insulin.

But not everyone in the U.S. has insurance, or is able to get it.

Smith-Holt said before her son died, he had just turned 26, which meant he was no longer eligible to stay on her insurance plan as of June 1, 2017.

On June 22, he went to the pharmacy to get more insulin. He was told it would cost $1,300 US. His body was found June 27.

""We are assuming he was hoping that what he had left he could stretch until payday,"" Smith-Holt said. ""He was just three days short of that payday when he passed away.""

High cost of insurance

While there are programs that exist for people over 65 or low-income families, the only other options in the U.S. are coverage through work or to buy it out of pocket.

Lija Greenseid, who organized the Caravan to Canada, lives in St. Paul, Minn. Her 13-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes and she and her husband buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

Last year, she said they spent $13,000 US just to obtain health insurance — and then $14,000 US out of pocket before her daughter's insulin was covered.

""It's a huge amount of money for us. Because of that, we didn't put any money into our kids' college savings accounts or put anything into retirement for the year. We really just had to pay our health-care bills,"" Greenseid said.

""So now you can see why we do crazy things like go across the border and buy insulin.""

Quinn Nystrom holds the insulin she bought on her trip to Canada. (Submitted by Quinn Nystrom)

Their fears around crossing the border come from confusion and uncertainty about what's allowed to be brought back into the U.S.

The U.S. Border Patrol declined to answer questions directly and referred CBC News to its website and to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The Border Patrol website says Americans travelling with prescription medication should have it in its original containers, have a copy of the prescription on hand and carry only personal-use quantities, which is a 90-day supply. It was unclear whether the same rules apply to medication bought outside the country.

The FDA did not reply by deadline for this story.

Len Saunders, an immigration lawyer in Blaine, Wash., on the border with Surrey, B.C., said he's never seen issues with bringing back medication as long as it's not a controlled substance.

""I don't think Americans care about people bringing insulin back to the U.S.,"" he said.

'They're a national embarrassment'

But crossing the border isn't an option for everyone.

""I don't think it's a long-term solution. And I also think it's sort of a cop-out for the U.S. government,"" Nystrom said.

""They want to say what a sophisticated country they are, how advanced they are, how they're one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and to me they're a national embarrassment and they are not taking care of their citizens.""

In February, the American Pharmacists Association and the Canadian Pharmacists Association issued a joint statement warning that drug importation policies could put patients at risk.

Power, with the Canadian association, said they wanted to highlight that crossing the border to get ""cheaper drugs"" from Canada is not a solution to problems in the U.S.

""They need to work on addressing the root causes that are causing the price disparities and making Americans take extreme measures to go outside the country to get their medication,"" he said.

Dr. LaShawn McIver agrees. The senior vice-president of government affairs and advocacy with the American Diabetes Association said 39 per cent of Americans saw the cost of their insulin increase in the last year.

""If people are travelling to other countries because they can't afford their insulin, then that's a problem,"" said McIver.

She said the U.S. federal health agency is looking at importing lower-cost drugs from other countries. But the American Diabetes Association wants to see changes at home so that insulin is more affordable.

She said the association is working with Congress to find solutions, and is calling for price transparency laws.

The Caravan to Canada drove five hours to the border. The caravan's hashtag, #Insulin4all, is seen on the back of one of the cars. (Quinn Nystrom)

While everyone agrees crossing the border isn't a sustainable option, it's likely to continue.

Nystrom said she knows of a group from Michigan that drove up to Canada on Thursday. She's planning another trip in June.

Greenseid wants to rally state politicians in Minnesota to sponsor a bus to bring people to Canada to buy insulin.

""As a mom, I do this lovingly for my child, but I really want to work for change so that it's easier for her when she gets older,"" Greenseid said. ""Because it's just too expensive.""

"I wish them both the best of luck. However the reality is our system is not kind to independent candidates even strong ones. They likely wont win  because of this, which is a shame because they are both good parliamentarians.","Former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott will seek re-election as Independent candidates in the fall election campaign, having rejected an offer to join the Green Party after weeks of talks with leader Elizabeth May.

The MPs made their announcements at separate, back-to-back news conferences in their ridings, nearly two months after being expelled from the Liberal caucus.

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

I see only 1 comment suggesting that so the only thing staggering is your bullshitting,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."

""We are still waiting for an explanation about why this is necessary,"" Charles Taylor told Jolin-Barrette at legislative hearing in Quebec City.

If passed, the bill would bar Quebec civil servants in positions of authority — including public teachers, police officers and Crown prosecutors — from wearing garments like the kippa or hijab while at work.

Just over a decade ago, Taylor and sociologist Gerard Bouchard co-authored a landmark government study into how best to accommodate religious minorities.

In response to Taylor's challenge, Jolin-Barrette argued that large parts of his bill were inspired by the Bouchard-Taylor report. But Taylor replied they never recommended stripping teachers of the right to wear religious symbols.

""No right is without a limit,"" Taylor said. He added, though, that trampling on fundamental rights — such as religious freedom — required a good reason, something the government had yet to provide.

That point was echoed in later testimony by Quebec's human rights commission and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, one of only two religious groups invited to speak at the hearings.

""We don't think the government has demonstrated that there is a serious threat to secularism in Quebec,"" said Dan-Michaël Abécassis of CIJA.

Taylor has since backed away from one of the most discussed recommendations of the 2008 report, which suggested that police and judges not be allowed to display signs of their faith.

Watch Charles Taylor argue why Bill 21 has a particular impact on Muslim women:

While Bill 21 does not target one religion specifically, Charles Taylor argues it must be understood in the context of a society ""full of Islamophobia."" 0:59

He changed his mind, he said, when he saw the consequences of proposing limits on religious expression.

""Campaigning on this issue stirs up hate,"" Taylor said. ""You can't exaggerate the alienation this causes for minorities.""

Taylor testified alongside Jocelyn Maclure, a Université Laval philosopher who also worked on the Bouchard-Taylor report. Maclure issued his own challenge to the government: produce studies that show religious symbols by themselves lead to conversion.

""I'm still waiting to see those studies because they don't exist,"" Maclure said.

Muslim women equated with 'fundamentalists'

The two philosophers were the first critics of the bill to appear before the committee on the first of six days of hearings into the draft legislation.

All the groups who testified to that point backed the bill, even suggesting it go further. They want to see it applied to private school teachers and daycare workers.

Some of these groups didn't hesitate to use fiery language to describe the danger of not passing strict limits on religious symbols in the civil service.

Djemila Benhabib, an outspoken secularism advocate, equated Muslim women who refuse to remove their hijab at work with extremists.

""Women who wear the hijab … are engaging in emotional blackmail when they say they won't take it off. I consider them to be fundamentalists,"" said Benhabib, who represent a group called Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité.

(Premier François Legault disagreed with Benhabib's characterization, saying: ""Let's be careful with the labels."")

'The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,' Jolin-Barrette said as he opened the hearings. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Another group speaking for secular North Africans tabled a document that said women who wear the hijab ""aren't really Muslim.""

The Liberal secularism critic, Hélène David, asked the group what they thought about women who wear the hijab by choice.

""You don't understand indoctrination,"" she was told by Ferid Chikhi.

Will government make concessions?

The Coalition Avenir Québec has a strong majority, and has indicated it wants to pass by the bill by the end of June.

But Legault has also said he wants to build broader support among the opposition parties, if possible. So far, only the Parti Québéois has expressed any openness.

The price of their support, the PQ interim leader said Tuesday, is extending the bill to private schools and daycares, as well as clarifying how it will be enforced.

Djemila Benhabib, representing the Collectif citoyen pour l'égalité et la laïcité, said Tuesday that some Muslim women who wear the hijab are 'fundamentalists.' (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)

Jolin-Barrette, the bill's sponsor, told reporters before the hearings began that the government wouldn't negotiate on a number of points. Chief among them, he said, was the bill's invocation of the notwithstanding clause.

That would protect the eventual law from court challenges based on claims it violates religious freedoms.

Along with the measures targeting teachers, the use of the nothwithstanding clause is arguably the bill's most controversial feature, roundly denounced by legal experts and civil rights advocates.

Jolin-Barrette opened the hearings by addressing the widespread criticism the draft legislation has attracted. He said the 2018 election gave the government a clear mandate to move forward with its proposals.

""The government of Quebec is convinced it has found the right balance between individual rights and collective rights,"" he said."
And each one of them make assholes of money,"Canada's labour market delivered a surprise Friday with its biggest one-month employment surge since 1976, when the government started collecting comparable data.

The country added 106,500 net jobs in April, and the bulk of them were full time, Statistics Canada said in its latest labour force survey.

The unexpected increase helped drop the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent last month, from 5.8 per cent in March.

The labour market has seen strong employment numbers since mid-2016 and has remained a bright spot for an economy that has struggled in other areas — to the point it almost stalled over the winter.

Employment grew 0.6 per cent with the April increase — the highest proportional monthly expansion since 1994.

Numbers far outstrip estimates

Economists had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs for the month and the unemployment rate to remain at 5.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

A closer look at the April numbers reveals the overall gain was driven by the creation of 73,000 full-time jobs and 83,800 positions in the private sector.

Compared with a year earlier, Canada added 426,400 jobs for a proportional increase of 2.3 per cent. The labour market has created an average of 36,000 jobs per month over the past year.

Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy. - Brian DePratto, senior economist, TD Economics

Year over year, average hourly wage growth for all employees in April was 2.5 per cent, up from a reading of 2.4 per cent for March. Wage growth is a key indicator monitored by the Bank of Canada ahead of its interest rate decisions.

""Nearly every indicator of quality came in strong this month: The best-ever gain came with solid full-time job growth, all in employees — rather than self-employed — more Canadians were drawn into labour markets and wages were up,"" said Brian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, in a written statement about the results.

""Chalk this one up as a solid message that employers still have faith in the Canadian economy.""

Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, told CBC News that the economy does seem to have some ""spring in its step.""

""It's hard to take seriously that we gained 100,000 or more jobs in a single month, but there's undoubtedly some truth to the idea that the weakness we've seen in the economy in the past two quarters is giving way to a better pace to growth as the weather and some other segments of the economy improve,"" Shenfeld said.

The gains were spread across many industries, with both the services and factory sectors seeing employment increases.

Employment rose by 32,400 in the category of wholesale and retail trade positions, while the construction sector added 29,200 jobs.

""Overall, the trend in job growth over the past year has been tilted towards services, while growth of goods producing industries like manufacturing have lagged. Construction was also in this camp, but jumped up this past month,"" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site Indeed Canada.

""A few factors could have helped boost construction employment like a rebound from a cold-winter, and a 23 per cent jump in housing starts in April, but we can't take too much from one month's worth of data.""

Labour economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter said she was glad to see some long-awaited wage growth.

""Wage growth has been sluggish throughout the recovery, but finally seems to be ticking upwards,"" said Pollak. ""We will need to see continued job gains for wage growth to solidify.""

Part-time positions for youth

A rush of 66,400 part-time positions for workers 15 to 24 years old helped lower the youth unemployment rate last month to 10.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent, the survey said.

Those part-time jobs are worth noting in context of the big overall number, Shenfeld said. ""The data do show that Canadians are working fewer hours per job and that's a part of it.""

By region, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island all saw net job gains last month.

Desjardins senior economist Helene Begin said in a written statement that nearly 80 per cent of the overall gain was concentrated in Ontario, which added 47,100 jobs in April, and in Quebec, which saw its jobless rate fall to 4.9 per cent for its lowest level since the survey's creation in 1976.

The April increase put Canada back on the job-creation path following an interruption in March.

Overall employment dropped by 7,200 net jobs in March, the first monthly decrease after six consecutive months of rising employment between September and February."
if it's not the government its the companies that decide. which one do you pick?,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

"It is, the sentence is for life; but in a compassionate society like Canada there is a hope that people can be rehabilitated. This means that parole be considered. In this case he cannot apply for parole until he's served 50 years of his sentence.","""Callous"" killer Edward Downey, who murdered a five-year-old girl and her mother, has been sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole for 50 years.

In December, a jury convicted Edward Downey of first-degree murder in the deaths of Sara Baillie and her daughter, Taliyah Marsman, 5, who were killed on July 11, 2016.

Downey, 49, will be 96 years old when he can apply for release from prison.

""The gravity of the offence, Mr. Downey's moral blameworthiness and his degree of responsibility are at the highest level. After kidnapping Taliyah, Mr. Downey planned and deliberated upon her murder for some hours before he killed her,"" wrote Court of Queen's Bench Justice Beth Hughes in her decision.

Both victims died by asphyxiation. Baillie was found wrapped in duct tape and stuffed inside a laundry hamper. Her daughter's body was found days later, in a rural area east of the city.

'Just about out the door'

Baillie had witnessed Downey abuse her best friend, a woman who can only be identified as AB.

Downey blamed Baillie for encouraging his girlfriend — the victim's best friend — to break up with him. This would have meant Downey, who was broke, would soon be homeless as well.

On the morning of July 11, 2016, ""Ms. Baillie was just about out the door to take Taliyah to daycare when Mr. Downey arrived,"" wrote Hughes.

Downey wrapped duct tape around Baillie's face, hands and wrists, smothering and then strangling her before stuffing her body in a hamper. He then took Taliyah for several hours before deciding to kill the child as well.

After he killed his victims and while he was in the middle of dumping the child, Downey was exchanging flirtatious text messages with a woman.

Those messages show Downey felt no remorse, according to the judge.

Taliyah 'the sole witness'

Though he had hours to change his mind, Downey murdered Taliyah because she would have been able to identify him as her mother's killer.

""By murdering Taliyah, Mr. Downey killed the sole witness to her mother's murder. His text conversations after dumping Taliyah's body outside of the city reveal a callous and remorseless individual,"" wrote Hughes.

Before handing down her sentence on Tuesday, Hughes rejected Downey's bid for a mistrial.

Defence lawyer Gavin Wolch had argued for a judicial review based on the discovery of one juror's political connections which could have been in contravention of the Jury Act which prohibits certain people from serving based on political employment.

Baillie's uncle Scott Hamilton spoke outside the courtroom after the sentence was handed down, thanking police, prosecutors Carla MacPhail and Ryan Jenkins and the judge."
"I was thinking more the independents but that's still a good point.

It just pissed me off that fucking Walmart was allowed to sell booze before actual Canadians. It makes me sick.","Some 7,000 unionized employees at the Beer Store are urging Premier Doug Ford not to make it last call for the private retailer by expanding brew sales to corner stores.

The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada Local 12R24 on Friday launched a public awareness blitz against Ford’s plan to liberalize the selling of beer and wine.

Three 30-second radio ads began airing across the province, blasting the premier for proposing “to spend $1 billion shutting down the Beer Store,” bankrolled by cuts to health care and education.

“Premier Ford, keep your promise that no one will lose a job,” a male announcer intones in each of the hard-hitting attack ads.

John Nock, the president of the union local, warned “the Ford government is creating chaos for communities by pushing ahead with corner-store beer sales.”

“Right now, beer prices before taxes in Ontario are among the lowest in Canada due to our efficient distribution system to outlets that are equipped to handle beer safely,” said Nock of the 450-outlet chain owned by Labatt, Molson, Sleeman and about 30 small Ontario breweries.

“Study after study has shown that beer prices will rise due to higher distribution costs and the usual convenience store markups,” he said.

“That is what happened in Alberta when it privatized alcohol sales, which Doug Ford’s $1,000-a-day alcohol consultant Ken Hughes knows too well because he profited from it as a partner in Alberta Spirits Inc.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes no longer has any stake in Alberta Spirits Inc., which is now owned by the company that runs that province’s largest booze chain, Liquor Depot.

Ford and Finance Minister Vic Fedeli hired him to oversee the expansion of alcohol sales in Ontario.

But Fedeli has emphasized that the government is not contemplating a sell-off of the LCBO, the provincially owned 660-store chain that has a monopoly on liquor sales in Ontario.

Industry sources have told the Star that Queen’s Park could be on the hook for at least $1 billion in payouts to the Beer Store if it breaches a 10-year deal signed in 2015 with the previous Liberal government that expanded sales to 450 supermarkets.

That would be to compensate the brewers for $100 million already spent on infrastructure improvements, lost profits during a two-year price freeze in the contract, and the cost of winding down the chain, including severance payments, pension liabilities,\ and broken lease penalties.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Hughes has dismissed that as “fear-mongering.”

The premier’s booze czar has noted the province has “tools in our tool kit” to get the breweries, who have operated the chain since the end of Prohibition in 1927, to agree to revised terms.

But he has declined to discuss what those measures might be, stressing it was “premature” and “irresponsible” to discuss compensation to the Beer Store for cancelling the accord.

The complex 10-year deal highlights potential liabilities for scrapping the deal.

“An arbitration tribunal ... shall treat all obligations in this agreement ... as binding and enforceable against the province despite its status as the Crown, even where the alleged breach results from a change in legislation or public policy,” the 27-page accord states.

“Such an award shall be calculated on the basis of the normal principles of damages for breach of contract.”

Nock warned beer prices would inevitably rise because distribution costs will increase.

“If the government really wants to lower beer prices, it would reduce Ontario taxes, which are among the highest in Canada. It’s definitely not ‘for the people.’”

Fedeli ducked questions last week about whether he would lower beer taxes, which are much higher in Ontario than in Quebec or Alberta, the two jurisdictions he touts when promoting looser beer restrictions.

Marie Heinein explained it to me.,"The Crown's case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman unexpectedly began to collapse in March partly under the weight of information from several former Conservative cabinet ministers and staffers, CBC News has learned.

They were key players in the previous government's $668 million deal to have the Davie Shipyard, in Levis, Que., convert and lease a supply ship to the navy, say multiple sources, some of whom were interviewed by a lawyer representing the former vice-chief of the defence staff.

These individuals were never questioned by the RCMP or the Crown in the run-up to a breach of trust charge being laid against Norman a year ago.

The former commander of the navy was accused of leaking cabinet secrets on 12 separate occasions, almost all of them involving the period of time prior to the last election.

What became clear — throughout the process — was that Norman was working in close cooperation with staff in former prime minister Stephen Harper's office in order to make the deal happen.

""There was a political will to get this done,"" said one former Conservative staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was intimately familiar with the project at the outset.

As the case against Norman developed, many members of the former government expected the Mounties to come knocking. But they never did, said the staffer.

Allusions to the involvement of Harper's office were sprinkled through court records in interviews with federal bureaucrats conducted by the RCMP, but the extent to which the former commander of the navy worked with them was not made clear.

The Crown acknowledged Wednesday that it did not have the full picture when it decided to charge the 38-year military veteran.

""It's a complex legal charge,"" said lead Crown attorney Barbara Mercier. ""We didn't have the entire information.""

'It should have been handed over'

The new evidence, gathered by Norman's lawyers and presented to the Crown on March 28, included some documents which were not uncovered during the investigation, something Norman's lead defence lawyer blamed on government obstruction.

""It should have been handed over,"" Marie Henein told reporters. ""It should have been handed over to the prosecution. It was not. As to the why, I don't know. I leave you to answer that.""

The Crown announced earlier today that it had stayed the charge against Norman, saying new information had come to light through Norman's defence team that convinced the prosecution there was no longer a reasonable chance of conviction.

Norman was accused of leaking to both an executive at the Davie Shipyard and to a CBC journalist.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also announced Wednesday the federal government would be paying Norman's legal fees. A private crowdsourcing initiative already has raised more than $400,000 for Norman's defence.

The prosecution said Norman's actions were inappropriate and secretive, but that doesn't mean a crime was committed.

""Inappropriate does not mean criminal,"" said Mercier.

A breach-of-trust charge can be laid against an appointed or elected official discharging a public duty.

To convict, the Crown must prove the accused person's conduct represented a ""serious and marked"" departure from the standards expected in that position, and that the accused acted outside the public interest towards a dishonest, partial, corrupt or oppressive purpose."
"pssst, wanna know a secret about the drug war? being illegal doesn't stop people from doing drugs, but it can stop them from getting help","Voters narrowly made Denver the first U.S. city to decriminalize psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in ""magic mushrooms.""

Decriminalization led by a slim 51 per cent, according to preliminary figures on Tuesday's election released by Denver's Election Division. As many as 1,300 votes still remain to be counted, but that figure was not enough to swing the vote the other way, division spokesperson Alton Dillard said.

Final election results will be released on May 16, he said.

Organizers turned to the same strategy that marijuana activists used to decriminalize pot possession in the city in 2005. That move was followed by statewide legalization in 2012. A number of other states have since broadly allowed marijuana sales and use by adults.

Organizers say their only goal in the mushroom measure is to keep people out of jail in Denver for using or possessing the drug to cope with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and other conditions.

The initiative effectively decriminalizes use or possession of psilocybin by people 21 and older, making it the lowest enforcement priority for police and prosecutors. It does not legalize psilocybin or permit its sale by cannabis businesses.

Kevin Matthews, director of the Decriminalize Denver campaign, said psilocybin has helped him deal with depression for years.

""This is not something you have to take every day,"" the 33-year-old Denver native said. ""It provides a lot of lasting benefits, weeks and months after one experience.""

Used in religious practices

Psilocybin has been federally outlawed since the 1960s, when it was widely known as a recreational drug. The ban stymied medical research, but small studies in recent years have found the substance had positive effects on anxiety and depression for cancer patients.

Users have described seeing vivid colours and geometric patterns and experiencing powerful spiritual connections and emotions.

Magic mushrooms have been used in religious practices for decades because of their powerful effect on perceptions and spiritual experiences. Those same effects have appealed to recreational users dating to the 1960s counterculture movement.

A California effort to decriminalize psilocybin failed to qualify for the statewide ballot in 2018. Organizers in Oregon are trying to gather enough support to put an initiative to a statewide vote next year.

Mayor opposed initiative

It took the pro-psilocybin organizers in Denver three tries to develop language approved by city officials for the ballot. They collected more than 8,000 signatures to qualify for Tuesday's election.

Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and District Attorney Beth McCann opposed the initiative, but there was no organized campaign against decriminalization. The city's election largely focused on a six-way race for mayor and a heated effort to end Denver's ""urban camping"" ban that affects people without housing.

Voters roundly rejected an end to the camping ban. In the mayor's race, incumbent Michael Hancock will face a June 4 runoff election against challenger Jamie Giellis.

The mushroom ordinance also prevents city funds from being used to pursue criminal penalties on possession or use and creates a panel to study the effects of the change."

In her Vancouver-Granville riding this morning, Wilson-Raybould said a non-partisan approach is the best way to change the way politics is done in Canada.

She said she decided to seek re-election after hearing encouragement from people in the riding.

""With your support, I am confident that running as an independent is the best way to go about it at this time, and the best way to transform our political culture,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she will work with like-minded parties on issues like the environment. She said she believes the best way to tackle the big issues confronting Canada is through collective efforts.

""In this reality, there is less room for overt partisanship in our evolving democracy,"" she said. ""Rising to these challenges requires Ottawa to operate more openly and transparently in the spirit of non-partisanship with increased co-operation.""

Philpott told a gathering of supporters in her own Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville this morning that she was urged by her constituents to stay in federal politics, and that stepping back from the federal fray now would have sent the wrong message to young women.

She said people are growing tired of hyper-partisan politics and the fighting and dysfunction in the federal system, and instead want politicians to treat each other with respect and look for real solutions.

""We need political will and who better to build political will than independent voices who aren't afraid of anybody?"" she said.

'They weren't interested'

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said today she was disappointed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott decided not to join her party after weeks of discussions.

She said she would have happily welcomed them as potential future leadership candidates, but it was a moot point because both politicians told her they had no aspirations to lead the Green Party.

""I was interested in making sure everything was on the table. They weren't interested,"" she said. ""I just wanted to discuss with them what was open, what's possible.""

(Turget Yeter/CBC )

May said that she has no immediate plan to step aside as leader and her eventual successor will be chosen by the grassroots members. She said she plans to stay on as an MP after a successor is chosen and, for that reason, she has a vested interest in backing a candidate with whom she could work well.

May said she couldn't say why the two ultimately decided not to join the Greens, but speculated they had feelings of ""deep unhappiness"" lingering from their involvement in the Liberal Party and felt reluctant to join another.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both praised May and the Green Party's commitment to fighting climate change, and promised to be allies on environmental issues.

Philpott said confronting issues like climate change, electoral reform and reconciliation with Indigenous people requires political collaboration.

'Cry for co-operation'

""These are all the big challenges that we can't solve if we're constantly fighting with one another,"" she said. ""This is a cry for co-operation. Let's co-operate. Let's collaborate. It's the only way we're going to solve these hard problems.""

Philpott said she hopes other people who don't fit into a partisan ""box"" will put their names on the ballot as independent candidates.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the two MPs statements today serve as a ""clear reminder"" that there's no room in the Liberal Party for those who stand up to Justin Trudeau.

""While it is unfortunate that the Liberal leader kicked Ms. Jody Wilson Raybould and Dr. Jane Philpott out of caucus for simply telling the truth in the face of his scandals, it is heartening to hear that they have decided to continue standing up for what they believe in,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus on April 2, saying trust with the two former cabinet ministers had been irreparably broken as the government worked to beat back allegations that officials inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Soured relations with the two MPs came to a head when Wilson-Raybould released a secretly taped audio recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, who has since retired as clerk of the Privy Council.

Trudeau delivered news of the expulsions to the national Liberal caucus during an open, televised meeting, saying the two could not stay on because they could not express confidence in the caucus.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,"" he said at the time.

""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Inappropriate political pressure

The political saga has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt she had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction company had been seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a trial, but Wilson-Raybould had decided not to overturn the public prosecutor's decision to proceed with prosecution.

During an inquiry by the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould testified she faced ""veiled threats"" and inappropriate pressure by the Prime Minister's Office and other government officials to change her mind.

After her expulsion, Wilson-Raybould said she had no regrets and ""spoke the truth.""

'Profoundly disheartening'

""What I can say is that I hold my head high, and that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party,"" she said on Twitter.

Philpott, who was considered one of the most respected and competent members in Trudeau's cabinet, said the development was ""profoundly disheartening.""

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus.

The Liberal Party said there will be a nomination process in the coming weeks to select a candidate for Markham-Stouffville.

""The Liberal Party of Canada is continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming the Team Trudeau candidate in Markham-Stouffville,"" a statement from the party reads.

"The only thing I care about is stopping the deplatforming and censorship of dissidents and political candidates. However, him making this move alongside his pledge to give the Christchurch shooter everything he wanted makes me think he's going in the opposite direction.","OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says social media platforms and tech giants have failed Canadian users and it’s time the government stepped in.

According to prepared remarks obtained by the Star, the Liberal government is set to unveil a framework for reining in tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The so-called “Digital Charter” will outline the government’s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate — and Trudeau said the government is considering “meaningful” financial penalties for companies that break the rules.

Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world’s largest tech companies signed on to the “Christchurch Call,” a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.

In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new “Wild West” — and suggests the time for regulation has come.

“It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that’s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,” Trudeau’s speech read.

“It’s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.”

The speech is sparse on details of what the “Digital Charter” will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians’ right to privacy.

Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau’s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?

The international push to do just that appears to be growing.

Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant’s data gathering. And the European Union’s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens’ right to privacy in the information age.

The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.

In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.

“With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,” Trudeau’s speech reads.

“It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.”

Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies — Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter — issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.

“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,” the companies’ joint statement read.

“Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”

The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to “detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,” creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and “working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.”

But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.

Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.

“(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it’s not an official thing, it’s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,” Owen said in an interview Wednesday.

“The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.”

Why we need to make it a law for politicians who accept lobbied money from corperation to be treated like NASCAR driver's. They are required by law to have their logo plastered on their suits as long as they're in office.,"A Canadian non-profit that advocates for an open and affordable internet wants Ottawa to make electronic devices like smartphones easier to fix.

Less than two months ago, OpenMedia started a petition calling on the federal government to put in place ""right to repair"" legislation. It's garnered more than 11,000 signatures and raised thousands of dollars.

""[Electronics are] treated as disposable,"" said executive director Laura Tribe. ""There's nothing that will increase your cell phone bill more than dropping and shattering your screen.""

Tribe says government legislation would force electronics giants to give consumers and small businesses the tools to repair those shattered screens, and other problems with brand-name gadgets, by forcing companies to make manuals, software and parts available at a ""reasonable and non-discriminatory price.""

Currently, many devices can only be repaired by the manufacturer or not at all, she says.

""We're really making sure people have the power to really own their devices.""

Ontario's 'right to repair' bill

Earlier in May, the Ontario government voted down a private member's bill aimed at making tech repairs easier introduced by Liberal MPP Michael Coteau at second reading.

Days before the vote, Coteau said in the Legislature, ""[The current approach] forces people, too often, to simply throw away a product rather than repairing that product and supporting a local business that does that.""

When asked by Coteau if he would support the bill, Minister of Government and Consumer Services Bill Walker said the law would ultimately ""limit consumer choice"" by making electronics harder to access as businesses could choose not to bring new products to market in the province.

""It would worsen Ontario's business climate, driving away innovation and jobs,"" he said, adding the bill would affect the intellectual property of the companies.

Coteau is confident the bill will come up again in the legislature even if he's the one who revives it.

""We need to have some say and some control in the world around us when it comes to digital devices,"" he told CBC News.

'Terrible for the environment'

Greenpeace points to another concern, arguing a law would be environmentally friendly.

""It reduces the amount of waste, particularly electronic waste,"" said Keith Stewart, the environmental groups's energy analyst.

Stewart used his washing machine at home as an example. He paid for a repair person who told him the device was done. His son, however, quickly found a solution to the problem by looking up a video online.

""The government claims to be for the little guy,"" he said. ""This is how you can concretely help the little guy.""

The federal Office of Consumer Affairs told CBC News it ""supports consumer interest research and undertakes analysis on marketplace issues to inform and support public policy development.""

However, it pointed out that the ""right to repair"" falls under provincial jurisdiction.

OpenMedia says it hopes the federal government will step in once it presents the petition."

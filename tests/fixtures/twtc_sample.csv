"A second-round pick by GPE in the NUMBER Draft, PERSON spent parts of two seasons in the D-backs' system before they dealt him to PERSON in the November NUMBER PERSON trade. Things started to click for PERSON in NUMBER at Double-A, as the then NUMBER-year-old impressed with his feel to hit and power potential, but he was unable to build upon that success last year in Triple-A. He did, however, make his big league debut in GPE, logging one at-bat with the ORGANIZATION, who traded him to the Cardinals NUMBER days later in the PERSON deal. He opened NUMBER behind schedule as a result of a fractured right hand suffered while punching a television during the offseason. A lower body injury in May then sidelined him for nearly a month. PERSON has always intrigued scouts with his natural hitting ability and projectable power, but it hasn't come together for him as quickly as it seemed it might earlier in his career. He has an aggressive approach and good bat-to-ball skills from the left side of the plate, and there's plenty of raw power for him to tap into. Right now, though, PERSON makes way too much ground-ball contact -- he's posted ground-ball rates north of NUMBER percent in every pro season -- so a mechanical adjustment may be necessary to unlock his potential at the plate.The D-backs moved PERSON from shortstop, his high school position, to the outfield at the start of his career. He's become an average defender out there, spending most of his time in left, with average arm strength that enabled him to record NUMBER outfield assists in NUMBER.",1
"Originally signed by the ORGANIZATION out of GPE in NUMBER, PERSON was dealt to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the NUMBER PERSON. He has developed a solid reputation as a hitter, producing good batting averages and low strikeout totals throughout his young career. PERSON has a quick, balanced swing and a good feel for the barrel, helping him hit line drives to all fields. So far that hasn't translated into much power, but scouts expect that part of his game to come as he physically matures. PERSON is a below-average runner, limiting him defensively. He is passable in left field, but his bat will have to continue to produce as he advances through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"GPE catchers are always in high demand, and short supply, come ORGANIZATION time. A left-handed hitting backstop who performs, no matter where, is bound to move up ORGANIZATION boards and that's exactly what was happening with PERSON as June approached.One of the best Division II talents in the country, PERSON can really swing the bat. He has plus bat speed from the left side of the plate with a good overall approach that should allow him to hit for average. He has plenty of power and could have even more as he learns to pull the ball more when needed. His overall catching is a work in progress, as he has limited agility, but many think he has the chance to stick behind the plate. He does have decent hands and good raw arm strength, though his exchange and footwork make his overall arm just average.Even if a team isn't sure PERSON can be a catcher long-term, there's a good chance one will buy the bat at some point in the early rounds.",0
"PERSON passed on signing with the ORGANIZATION as a NUMBERth-rounder in NUMBER and instead opted for his senior season at ORGANIZATION, where he posted a NUMBER.NUMBER ORGANIZATION and NUMBER saves to finish with the second-most saves (NUMBER) in program history. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their third-round pick in June, and he proved to be far more than just a money-saving selection during his pro debut after signing for $NUMBER,NUMBER below slot value.  PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON because he's a lanky, side-armed right-hander with two above-average pitches. His combination of a low NUMBERs fastball, that touches NUMBER mph, and a tight slider makes PERSON highly effective against same-sided hitters, and he's already impressed ORGANIZATION club officials with his ability to throw strikes from his unique slot.As a low-slot reliever who features both velocity and control, PERSON has the potential to jump on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION in NUMBER after reaching full-season ball during his pro debut.",0
"A talented two-way player from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON wanted to hit as a pro. Many teams liked him more as a pitcher, but the ORGANIZATION were more than willing to let him swing the bat. A slow starter in each of his first two full pro seasons, PERSON still mashed his way to Double-A at age NUMBER, collecting NUMBER or more home runs in each of those years. He capped off NUMBER with a strong ORGANIZATION, finishing first in slugging, second in home runs and third in OPS.There has never been any question about PERSON's raw power and earlier questions about his ability to tap into it consistently have thus far been answered. He's become a better overall hitter and is quicker to the ball than when he first entered pro ball. While he'll always rack up strikeouts, he did lower his K rate and improve his walk rate in NUMBER while moving up the ladder. PERSON also made huge strides in his defense at third and there are no longer concerns about his ability to stay at the hot corner, where his plus arm has always played well. He runs better than people might think at first glance, and some feel his athleticism would allow him to move to left field if there was a need or someone blocking him in GPE. For now, he'll continue to improve in all facets of the game as a third baseman, where he looks like he'll fit the power-hitting, run-producing profile in the mold of a ORGANIZATION type of player.",1
"On the ORGANIZATION and in the first half of his junior spring, PERSON looked like a solid third round prospect, a pitchability lefty sitting NUMBER-NUMBER mph with mostly average stuff, and above-average feel and command. In the month or so leading up to the draft, PERSON's velo ticked up, and down the stretch he sat NUMBER-NUMBER, touching NUMBER mph deep into starts, with an assortment of offspeed pitches that all flashed above-average. The track record of GPE arms is concerning, but PERSON seemed less beholden to the issues traditionally associated with their prospects, with some scouts considering him endearingly rebellious. 
He throws a cutter, slider, curveball, and changeup that all flash above-average, with the slider occasionally flashing plus. He was NUMBER-NUMBER this spring, so the velo uptick has held for nearly a year now. He's a potential No. NUMBER if this continues, maybe more if it's just the start of something.",0
"PERSON had a great draft year. He had a plus arm, above-average speed and defense, solid-average raw power, and performed on paper.  The concern was that his swing was a little stiff and had a grooved, invariable path, and it was thought that this might limit his offensive upside and relegate him to a fourth outfielder role. A year and change later, and that's largely still the report, with likely outcomes ranging from low-end everyday center fielder to NUMBER-man filler/emergency callup depending on how his offense progresses.",0
"Recruited by PERSON as a two-way player, PERSON saw little action as a pitcher or an infielder as a freshman in NUMBER. He did, however, experiment with dropping his arm slot, which improved the velocity and life on his fastball. The ORGANIZATION liked the results enough to draft him in the NUMBERth round out of ORGANIZATION (Fla.) JC in NUMBER and sign him away from an ORGANIZATION State commitment for $NUMBER,NUMBER.PERSON worked with a mid-NUMBERs fastball from a more conventional three-quarters arm angle. While most pitchers lose velocity when they throw from a lower slot, he saw his fastball jump to NUMBER-NUMBER mph and top out at NUMBER while at ORGANIZATION. In his third pro season, he was operating at NUMBER-NUMBER mph with quality sink that yields a lot of groundouts before sustaining a slight tear in his trapezius muscle in mid-May.Hitters have trouble squaring up PERSON's sinker when he keeps it down in the zone. He backs it up with a hard, sweeping slider that is quite effective against right-handers. He's having much more success against left-handers in NUMBER after they hit him hard in his first two years as a pro, and if he keeps that up, he could start to rise quickly through the Minors.",0
"The ORGANIZATION spent a franchise-record $NUMBER.NUMBER million on bonuses and penalties for their NUMBER-NUMBER international class, including $NUMBER million in a bonus and tax for PERSON and $NUMBER,NUMBER for PERSON. A ORGANIZATION, he didn't reach full-season ball until August NUMBER but jumped to Double-A NUMBER months later. Though he succeeded as a starter in NUMBER, his small frame led GPE to make him a full-time reliever in NUMBER.Now that he's working out of the bullpen, PERSON relies primarily on two pitches. He attacks hitters up in the strike zone with a four-seam fastball that sits at NUMBER-NUMBER mph and touches NUMBER, then drops in a low-NUMBERs curveball that shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. He didn't exhibit much feel for or trust in his changeup as a starter.PERSON creates deception by hiding the ball well and employing a high arm slot that gives him some downhill angle and helps him stay on top of his curveball. He has mostly pounded the strike zone since coming to the GPE in NUMBER, though his control wasn't as sharp after he first arrived in Double-A. He could develop into a seventh-inning reliever at the big league level.",0
